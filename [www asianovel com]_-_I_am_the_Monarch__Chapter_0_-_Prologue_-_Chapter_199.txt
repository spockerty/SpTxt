I am the Monarch


나는 군주다





Roan, ran away 20 years ago from his rural village in the aim of becoming a Great General. However, all he got 20 years later was just a handful of money and the lowly position of squad commander of the First Legion’s.

In the end, he became a cold corpse in the battlefield… but somehow, he came back in the past.

“Alright. This time, I won’t become a Great General but a Monarch.”

His previous life’s aim was becoming a Great General, but, he only became a spearman squad commander.

This time, his life’s aim is becoming the Monarch.

“Then I guess I’d become at least a General, right?”

Roan, who remembers 20 years of his future, now starts his unstoppable march.

Chapter 0 - Prologue




‘In the end it ends like this.’

A hollow laugh forced itself out.

However, I’m not surprised nor do I feel it to be unfair.

Because I knew that I was going to die like this.

“Whew.”

He let out a long sigh.

The steam slowly drifting from his mouth rose up towards the sky.

“There was a bastard alive over there.”

Noticing the steam from his breath, a few enemy soldiers came walking towards him.

‘Just let me be. Anyways, there’s already a hole in my stomach.’

He wanted to protest with that, but in the end he just let it be.

He remembered the spring from 20 years ago.

‘Was I 18 years old, when I ran out of the town saying: that I would become a great general that would command the entire world?’

After that, he kept struggling on the battlefield for 20 years.

And the results from all that ended with; that he only had a bit of money in his hands and that he belonged to the First Spearman Corps.

“What Great General? I’m going to die freezing to death. Damn it.”

His life flickered by like a revolving lantern.

‘What would have happened if I had participated in that surprise tactic? No, if I had enrolled when they were enlisting soldiers for the region of Bate? No, no. If I had gone West in that winter; when there was a monster subjugation operation?’

His thoughts brought him to the crossroads of his life with plenty of alternatives.

At that time, he foolishly chose one side without hesitating.

But the end results weren’t that good.

And because of that, he now lay with a hole in his stomach awaiting death’s cold and final embrace.

Soon, he could see the hostile expressions of enemy soldiers closing in…

‘Damn it.’

The curse ran through his throat.

Stab.

A steel sword stabbed his chest.

“Damn……it.”

His voice uttered feebly, devoid of strength… rolling out his final breath.

Roan of the First Spearman Corps, from the Rinse kingdom died just like that.

Chapter 1




“Huff!”

A clogged breath exploded out.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

His chest heaved like he had been running for the whole day.

‘Did I die?’

He felt strange.

His senses felt dull just like when he had woken up from a dream, and his headache hurt as if it would split apart.

At that moment, he felt a sharp impact on the back of his head.

Thwack!

“This bastard of a greenhorn slipping out! You dare to sleep while we are on standby for battle?”

Roan looked back with his cloudy eyes while touching the back of his head.

“Oh? Are you glaring at me right now?”

It was a robust man with a square chin.

He couldn’t see well because his field of vision bothered him, but Roan knew who he was.

“Mister Pete?”

It certainly was Pete.

The Corporal of Rose battalion, 7th Division, that he’d first been assigned to 20 years ago.

‘But he died in the monsters subjugation 20 years ago……..’

Roan frowned.

‘In the end, you meet dead people again.’

At that moment, he stood up and extended his hand, feeling glad to see him again.

“It’s been a long time. Nice to see you.”

He gave a pleasantly warm greeting while he smiled.

However, Pete’s expression wasn’t that good.

“This bastard!”

A punch quickly flew out, along with a curse.

Thwack!

“Kugh!”

Roan rolled on the ground after being hit.

Severe pain exploded through his body.

‘Damn it. Can you feel pain even after you die?’

He moved his chin.

At that time, he noticed his right hand, along with feeling the rest of his body.

It’s a really feeble looking body.

On top of that, the back of his hand was soft and clean.

‘What is this? Do you get younger when you die?’

Everything left him bewildered as he questioned himself.

At that moment, someone hurriedly came towards him and stopped him.

“Roan. Are you crazy? Why are you suddenly behaving like this?”

It was a noise so small, it seemed like it was whispering to him.

Roan slowly turned his head and looked at the owner of the voice.

“Pierce?”

A surprised look appeared over his face.

Roan’s face was much more surprised than when he first saw Pete.

“Why are you here…….? No, you became younger on top of that?”

Pierce didn’t die.

On top of that, he couldn’t die.

Because after he became a Duke of Rinse Kingdom, he no longer put himself in dangerous places like battlefields.

However, more than anything, he couldn’t understand how he became young again. It made him remember the first time they met 20 years ago.

“Are you crazy?”

Pierce slapped him with an expression full of panic.

Slap.

At that moment, Roan felt that his consciousness became clearer.

It was just like the fog in his head dissipated with the stinging slap.

And the dull senses became sharp just like before.

When that happened, he could clearly see the scene before him.

‘Is this the Rose battalion’s barracks?’

He was certain.

He was certain that it was the barracks the Rose battalion used 20 years ago.

It wasn’t a place such as heaven or hell.

On top of that, there were people seated in a line on the floor.

They were all familiar faces.

‘My comrades from the Rose battalion 20 years ago? What happened? Did I not die?’

It was a confusing situation for Roan.

However, his thoughts didn’t last for long.

“This bastard!”

Because Corporal Pete approached him with a solid front kick.

Bang.

“Kugh.”

Roan rolled on the floor and quickly curled himself up.

He hid his vitals by instinct.

But fortunately, Mr. Pete couldn’t continue kicking him.

It was due to the entrance of the barracks opening up, and a middle aged man with scary eyes appeared.

“What are you doing?!”

A sharp voice rang out.

Roan recognized the owner of that voice, even without looking at him.

‘Lieutenant Tane.’

His head started to spin.

‘I didn’t die.’

He slowly pinched the inner sides of his thigh.

He felt an intense sharp pain.

‘It’s not even a dream.’

Then only one thing remains.

‘Did I return to the past?’

It was difficult to believe, but it had the highest probabilities.

If that also wasn’t it, maybe the past 20 years of his life was just a dream.

‘Whatever it is, I’m still alive.’

Just this was enough for him.

Roan slowly stood up from where he laid, and hurriedly returned to his spot on the floor.

Tane frowned, but he didn’t press the issue further.

He didn’t have the leisure to do so right now.

“Everybody prepare. We will march through Ale Village and reach Pedian’s Plain.”

At that moment, everybody’s faces distorted.

“Oh damn. For it to be Ale Village.”

“If we went to Varen’s Castle I was planning to seriously relax myself.”

“That bar last time was fine, right?”

“Yeah. The female owner killed it.”

They talked amongst themselves and soothed their regretful feelings. Tane clapped.

Clap!

“Everybody shut your traps and move out quickly! Oliver take care of the new enlisted.”

“Yes!”

Oliver, who was tall and had a slim body, replied in a loud voice while approaching Roan.

“Everybody take out your helmets and armor now!”

At his words, the new enlisted soldiers including Pierce started to slowly equip their armor.

Oliver glared at Roan and started yelling as he was about to launch into a tirade of abuse.

“You stupid bastard! You too, quickly put them on. I’m looki…….”

He couldn’t finish his sentence.

Roan had skillfully equipped the armor and even finished organizing his kit in an instant.

‘What is this bastard? Why is he so skilled?’

Oliver was at a loss for words at the moment.

Clearly looking at how Roan was packing the equipment, he was even a step faster than himself.

‘I did these kind of things for 20 years.’

Roan had a bitter smile on his face.

Oliver wanted to say something, but as he had nothing else to point out, he turned back with a disappointed face.

At that time, Pierce’s beseeching voice rang behind his ear.

“Roan.”

His voice was so soft it barely seemed like he was whispering at him.

As Roan looked back, Pierce pointed at his equipment bag and wore a helpless expression.

‘You really are the same as 20 years ago.’

He was also like this back then.

Pierce, at that time, had a timid personality and didn’t have any talent. But on top of that; he had a small physique so he’d always asked him for help.

Roan walked towards him, and shook his head after packing his equipment in the bag.

‘For this guy to become the Duke of Rinse Kingdom surpassing even the Commander in Chief……..’

Just looking at him right now, it was something unbelievable.

‘He was fortunate. His life changed for the better; after he became apprenticed to the extraordinary Master Spearman: Viscount Reil Baker……..’

At that moment, Roan’s eyes became wide.

His fingers trembled.

“Roan. What happened?”

Pierce had a worried expression on his face, but it wasn’t a situation where he could mind that.

‘If it’s true that I have returned to the past, then I know what’s going to happen from now on.’

Although he didn’t remember all of the small details and accidents, he did remember the news that shook the world.

Especially, the battles and wars he had experienced for the past 20 years. He clearly remembered it all, to the point where if he was asked to make a report of it, he could write it all down.

Thump thump.

His heartbeat became faster.

‘I can become one.’

His two eyes became filled with a hot passion.

‘This time, I can become one.’

Roan’s face became bright red.

‘This time, I can really become a great general. A great general who can really command the entire nation.’

His smile dimmed all of a sudden.

‘No, no.’

The memories, experiences, and information he had weren’t at the level to satisfy him with only being a great general.

Grip.

He tightly clenched his fist.

‘At the very least, I should become a Monarch.’

From ancient times, they’ve said to dream bigger.

The objective of his past life was to become a great general.

But he became a spearman.

So the objective in this life was to become a monarch.

‘If that’s so, won’t I at least become a commander?’

On top of that, the starting line in this life was already different.

Because he knew what was going to happen from now on.

‘First………’

His recollection of the memories from 20 years ago.

The first battle.

That fierce memory.

At that moment, Roan’s face froze.

“Damn.”

He remembered.

The heartbreaking and miserable first battle.

Chapter 2




20 years had passed, but he remembered perfectly.

‘Excluding Pierce and I, all of the new enlisted died.’

It wasn’t only them, but Oliver and Lieutenant Tane had also lost their lives.

‘We were attacked near Ale Village by the goblins.’

It was a gorge which became narrower traversing through it.

That was where those bastards were hiding in ambush.

The Rose battalion who was moving carelessly, was almost completely annihilated.

‘What can I do?’

Warn the Captain about goblins waiting ahead to ambush them?

‘It would be fortunate if he doesn’t cut off my neck.’

There was no way they would listen to the words of a newcomer without any proof.

No, in the first place, he wouldn’t even have the qualifications to meet him.

‘Should I tell Lieutenant Tane?’

This wasn’t a good option.

In his memories, he didn’t really have a friendly disposition.

‘Then, do I have to endure again how the battalion was annihilated?’

He couldn’t do so.

He didn’t want to also ruin this second life.

Then, Roan’s face brighten up with reassuring smile.

‘Ah! There was that.’

The corner of his mouth slowly rose up.

He looked at Tane as if he were waiting for something; eyes filled with eagerness.

“Ah! Also…..”

Tane, who was packing his equipment, yelled with an expression as if he had remembered something of late.

“Is there someone who’s familiar with the region of Ale? Someone that’s lived in that region for a long time, or spent time there?.”

‘This is it!’

Roan took a step forward and raised his right hand.

“I know it well.”

“You?”

Tane frowned.

‘The guy who was being punished by Pete.’

Pete wasn’t the type to become violent for no reason.

Then that meant this guy in front of him had a problem.

‘Troublesome.’

The role of scout was certainly important.

If he made a mistake, he could put the whole battalion in danger.

“Are you really familiar with the region of Ale?”

“Yes! I am. I can go from here, Ellin’s fortress, to Ale Village with my eyes closed.”

“Mmm.”

Tane frowned and looked at Roan.

‘Well, the final decision is made by the Captain.’

He didn’t keep thinking about this for long.

In the first place, he wasn’t the type to do so.

“Fine. What’s your name?”

“It’s Roan.”

“You pack your things immediately and follow me.”

Tane walked while looking at Corporal Lander.

“Lander. If you finish your preparations, head to the training grounds with the squad.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Corporal Lander smiled as if telling him not to worry about it and nodded. Tane hit his chest and went outside.

Roan hurriedly followed behind his back.

As he went outside of the barracks, a familiar smell tickled the tip of his nose.

‘The smell of war. No, the smell of death.’

Ironware, bonfires, horses, sweat, soldiers and blood.

It was a smell that had many things mixed together.

It was a smell he’d sensed for the past 20 years until he became weary of it.

It was a disgusting smell, but somehow a corner of his heart felt more comfortable.

‘The more you become accustomed to this smell, the closer you are to death.’

Roan smiled bitterly and shook his head.

At that time, Tane, who was one step ahead of him, asked bluntly.

“Where are you from?”

“I’m from a small town in the mountains. Closer towards the borders within the Grain mountain ranges.”

“The Grain mountain range….. It’s a rough place.”

Tane commented like that and continued walking at a brisk pace.

‘A recruit from the Grain mountain range knows the region of Ale as well?’

He had a feeling that he was being deceived.

‘Well, I’m not the one to get punished.’

Tane smirked and halted at attention towards the man in front of him.

A middle aged man was seated at a table, while looking through a pile of documents.

“Captain Dosen.”

Tane approached him and bent down.

Dosen, a middle aged man, was one of the five captains in Rose battalion and he was in charge of reconnaissance.

‘He’s already picked quite a few.’

Tane’s gaze moved next to him.

He saw the other scouts from the remaining squads.

They already numbered more than ten.

“Oh. Tane.”

Dosen smiled brightly and greeted him with a nod of his chin.

Tane moved to the side and pointed at Roan.

“There’s also a soldier in our squad who is familiar with the region of Ale.”

“Really?”

Dosen looked at Roan.

“It’s my first time seeing him. Is he a newcomer?”

“Yes. He came in yesterday.”

“He’s a good looking guy.”

Dosen smirked while looking at Roan up and down.

“You are familiar with the region of Ale?”

“Yes.”

Roan replied without hesitating.

‘In my previous life the amount of battles in the region of Ale only amounted to twenty. Twenty…’

Because of that, the surrounding region was really familiar in his eyes.

Dosen nodded at his reply.

“Then should I ask you a simple question? What’s the specialty product of Ale?”

It wasn’t a difficult question.

“It’s barley.”

“Then, the largest village in the region of Ale?”

“It’s of course Ale. Continued by Riven Village, Moss Village, and Ferbus Village.”

He answered back without stopping.

‘All of the places where we had battles.’

Roan smiled.

Dosen nodded with a surprised expression.

“I hadn’t suspected you would even know about Ferbus Village. It seems like you are indeed familiar with this region. You are just perfect for a scout.”

Roan didn’t really talk about where he came from.

Because that wasn’t the important thing.

‘I’ll find the goblins hiding there and keep one step ahead of them.’

He looked at the scouts who were next to him.

‘Because of these fools not doing their job properly, many people died.’

Of course, he knew why they couldn’t discover the goblins.

This area was a safe region with no monsters at all.

So they also assumed that there was no way goblins would appear.

‘This time, I am preventing them.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

“Take this. Don’t lose it.”

Tane handed him one spear.

Roan nodded and tightly gripped it.

Grip.

It had a strong and heavy feeling to it.

‘Uncomfortable.’

His palms were excessively soft and smooth.

The injuries, and hardened skin he’d receive over the past 20 years had all disappeared.

‘It really is starting again.’

He smiled bitterly.

“Then, I will take my leave.”

Tane saluted at Dosen and walked his way towards the training grounds.

Roan took in a deep breath while looking at Tane’s back moving farther away.

“Don’t be too scared.”

A soldier, who was looking at him, patted consolingly on his shoulder.

He seemed to have misunderstood and believed that he was afraid.

“This much is nothing. Last year………”

He regaled Roan with his colorful tales of heroism for quite a while.

‘I also have 20 years worth of stories.’

When he started to talk, the story had no ending.

At that time, Dosen put aside the pile of documents.

“I think that this many guides will be enough. Mason. As you have the most experience, lead the other scouts.”

At his words, the soldier who was talking nonstop, smiled brightly and nodded.

“Understood! Just leave it to me!”

He gave an exaggerated answer.

He carried a look which made you unable to place any trust in him at all.

‘This is why you were ambushed by the goblins.’

Roan frowned.

‘It’ll become a bit troublesome if the Rose battalion were annihilated.’

In his past life, the Rose battalion was annihilated due to the ambush from the Goblins.

Because of that, all of the surviving soldiers along with Roan, were separated out and migrated into other squads.

‘Even if you pile in your efforts, it gets taken away by other guys.’

The stones that came rolling aren’t as appreciated as the fixed ones.

And originally, the soldiers whom were in the new squad already ignored him.

And taking the efforts of another was also a frequent scenario.

Because of that, even after he had caught a lot of monsters, he was reprimanded for moving alone.

‘I can’t live like that in this life.’

Grip.

He put strength into his hand.

“Well! We are also heading out to the training grounds.”

Mason’s loud voice rang out.

He moved one step ahead of them and started walking.

Roan followed behind his back while taking in deep breaths.

‘This is the start.’

The moment his life started again.

His heart beat faster.

Blow.

The cold wind that was blowing, carried the smell of the battlefield.

Chapter 3




In the expansive training grounds.

The soldiers were lined up in an orderly fashion.

In the middle of them, he saw the 13th Division where Tane and Pierce were located.

‘This nervousness……’

Even if it was a simple monster subjugation, before any battle, tension roamed anxiously.

Roan liked this tension.

‘This makes you feel alive.’

However, there was an existence that broke this tension.

“So last year, when I was in Loren’s Province……..”

Mason prattled on about his tall tales without stopping.

Although Roan’s face clearly showed he didn’t want to keep listening, it was useless.

“That time, I heroically evaded the spear a Orc threw at me……..”

Then a group appeared on the platform of the training grounds.

“……I…will…… Ahem.”

Mason’s mouth finally closed.

‘I think that I would be able to live in peace now.’

A smile appeared on Roan’s face.

The ones who walked onto the knee-high platform were the Lieutenant Colonel of Rose Battalion, Gale and his adjutants.

Dosen was also there.

Sit.

They were quiet and immediately sat down.

Gale stood on top of the platform and looked at the soldiers who were lined up.

“Our Rose Battalion will leave Ellin’s Fortress, and pass through Ale Village to reach Pedian’s Plain.”

“Yes!”

Loud replies came back to him. .

A smile appeared on Gale’s mouth.

‘If it’s this much, we can be called the best of 7th Division.’

He was quite proud of the soldiers of Rose Battalion who had to go through a lot of things with him over the past five years.

It was just like a parent looking at his child.

“Everybody, don’t die.”

These were words that seemed to be casually thrown out.

With that, the lieutenant colonel’s speech ended.

‘Right. Lieutenant Colonel Gale was the kind of person who appreciated his soldiers.’

He sacrificed himself, when the goblins ambushed them; in an attempt to try at least save one more person.

Later on, when rescue arrived, the corpse which had suffered the greatest amount of wounds on his body was Gale.

‘That kind of commander needs to live a long life.’

Roan’s eyes glittered sharply with determination.

Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.

Gale and his aides started to move towards the field.

Roan and the other scouts followed Mason and walked out at the front.

Stomp. Stomp. Stomp.

The repetitive steps of the marching army were noisy.

“Where did I finish off back then? Right. In that battle, I……”

He started again.

Mason talked on without resting having already forgotten the role of a scout.

‘Why is it me?’

There were many other scouts.

But why did it have to be him?

As he turned his head, he realized the reason.

The other scouts had kept their distance far away from him.

‘He was a famous bastard.’

They knew about the incredible talking ability Mason had.

Only the newcomer Roan didn’t know about it, and he fell into their trap.

Roan, who couldn’t hold it in anymore, opened his mouth cautiously.

“Don’t we have to check the surroundings in case monsters appear?”

“After that, I grabbed his wrist and then his legs, huh? What? Monster?”

Mason, who was even spitting while he was talking, put on an absurd facial expression.

He patted Roan’s back and shook his head.

“Look. Newcomer. There’s no need to worry this much. This area is the safest one. It’s a place where no monsters appear.”

“But……..”

“Ha. You are much more of a coward compared to how you look.”

Mason shook his head while he was clicking his tongue.

He frowned with a gaze, as if he was looking down on him.

However, Roan preferred those eyes.

Because in that moment, he stopped blathering his mouth.

At that time, they saw the peak of the mountain in front of them.

‘Rose Gorge. No, Ale Gorge.’

It was a small gorge which you had to pass through if you wanted to reach Ale Village.

The original name was Ale Gorge, but after the Rose Battalion was annihilated, it started to become known as Rose Gorge with that kind of historical meaning.

‘The day they changed the gorges name will not come to pass.’

Roan tightly gripped his spear while he dry gulped.

Step. Step. Step.

The scouts’ feet were near the gorge.

‘Now’s the time.’

Roan called out to Mason.

“Sir Mason.”

“Huh?”

“The form of this gorge doesn’t seem normal. Shouldn’t we investigate beforehand?”

“Gorge? Investigate?”

Mason frowned and looked at Ale’s Gorge.

And then he shook his head and clicked his tongue.

“You really are a coward. This is a safe area. There are no such things as monsters.”

“But couldn’t there be a possibility?”

“No, there’s absolutely not. This is one of the safest places within Rinse Kingdom.”

Mason was confident.

He was confident in so much as to thinking that there would be no one, who knew the region of Ale better than him.

‘I’m a native here.’

He turned his head and looked back at the other scouts.

“Hey. This newcomer here says that we need to investigate the gorge. What do you think?”

Most of the faces of the scouts distorted.

“What? Investigate? What dog shit are you talking about?”

“You really are a pleb. A greenhorn.”

“If you don’t know a thing, just shut up.”

Criticisms came pouring out of their mouths.

However, Roan’s face didn’t change in the slightest and still looked serious.

“However, all of our battalion have to pass through such a narrow gorge. If there are monsters hiding, we will take on heavy casualties.”

“Ha, really!”

In the end, Mason shouted.

He pointed at Roan’s face with his index finger to the extent where he almost poked him.

“Don’t say useless things. There’s no way that will happen.”

However, Roan wasn’t the type to back down right now.

Because he was very well aware as to what was about to happen .

“They also say we will have to arrive at a stone bridge and then cross it. If maybe, there are monsters waiting for us ……”

“Stop.”

Mason raised his hand and stopped him.

His face was bright red.

Gulp.

Roan nervously swallowed with his dry mouth.

The reason Roan could talk back like this, was because he didn’t directly belong to him.

These were actions which he could never attempt on Tane or Pete.

Mason glared at him as if he wanted to devour him, and in the end, spoke with an annoyed voice.

“If you want to investigate that much, go alone.”

“Can I?”

It was a grave offense to leave his rank.

Mason nodded.

“Go. I don’t think there would be anything bad happening by doing something in vain.”

He spoke these words as if he were mocking him.

However, Roan’s face brightened up.

“Then, I will be heading out.”

After he nodded, he started to move.

Running.

His legs couldn’t be seen.

Roan left the ranks and ran towards the gorge entrance. Gale, who was leading the front squad, noticed him.

“Who’s that soldier leaving the ranks? Seems to be running into the gorge?”

Dosen looked and then frowned.

“It seems like a soldier from the scouts. I’ll head over and check.”

“Mmm.”

Gale nodded with a disturbed expression on his face.

Because of an unauthorized solitary action, he could endanger the entire squad.

Dosen looked towards Gale while grabbing the reins.

Rattle. Rattle.

The canter of the horse became faster.

“Mason!”

Dosen found Mason.

Mason, who was looking at Roan running to the gorge, bent his head.

“Yes. Adjutant Dosen.”

“Who’s that bastard? Why did he leave the ranks as he pleased?”

His words poured out like a blazing flame.

Mason put on a bitter smile and scratched the back of his head.

“I wonder, that guy claimed there could be monsters hiding in ambush within the gorge, so he said it needed to investigated.”

“In the gorge? That bastard, doesn’t he know that this is a safe area?”

“He knows. But even so, he says that maybe…….”

Mason shook his head.

Dosen’s eyes were following Roan, who couldn’t even be seen, while he was frowning in disgust.

“Damn. Anyways, he was spotted by Lieutenant Colonel Gale. Maybe later you and that fellow will have problems.”

“Ah! I find it unfair! That guy kept stubbornly insisting ……”

“Shut up. You are the one placed in charge. You will also face punishment because you couldn’t properly control your guys.”

After Dosen fired those words, he turned his head back.

Whine.

He heard the neighing of the horse and thought perhaps it was making fun of him.

Mason looked at Dosen’s back who was riding farther away and then frowned.

“Damn. What is this? Because of a crazy newcomer bastard.”

After he spat, he looked back at Ale Gorge.

“But where did that bastard disappear off to?”

He thought that now, he would have to kick him in the crotch at least once.

Roan, who didn’t know that Mason was thinking like this, was approaching the entrance.

Shock.

The sharp senses he had accumulated over the past 20 years were telling him that it was dangerous.

‘Danger.’

A threatening aura could be felt all around the gorge.

Roan nervously gulped and grabbed his spear.

‘The only thing I need right now is acting.’

He didn’t need to move in deeper while facing danger.

He needed to return in a moderate amount of time, as if he had investigated the gorge and come back startled.

‘If I just say that there are goblins in the gorge, the end.’

A smile appeared on Roan’s face.

He leaned on a trunk of a large tree.

It was a clear blue sky without clouds.

“Right. The weather was this good.”

He remembered his past memories.

The day when they were attacked by the goblins.

The sky that day was a deep blue.

“Just like we have gone on an excursi……..”

He swallowed back the words he was mumbling.

Shock.

His body tensed up.

The hair on his skin rose up and dried sweat started to flow again on his back.

‘There’s something here.’

Inside the forest that didn’t have anything until now.

However, he felt a frightening presence.

The noise he heard at that time.

Chwee.

Roan’s face froze in an instant.

‘Goblins!’

It was certainly the shriek of a goblin.

Chwee.

The noise came closer.

Chapter 4




Gulp.

His adam’s apple roughly shook.

‘Two? No. Three.’

Roan lowered his posture while he was still leaning on the tree.

Whoosh.

The leaves blown by the wind, rustled on the ground.

Chwee. Chwee.

The shrieking of the goblins grew closer.

Stealthily.

Roan slowly unsheathed his short sword.

It was an old and dull short sword.

However, it was enough to complete this task.

Chwee.

A sound was heard nearby.

‘Now!’

Roan quickly turned his body.

And then he saw the goblin right in front of his eyes.

Chwee!

The goblin fell in a state of confusion when he saw Roan suddenly appear.

Roan didn’t let this opportunity pass and quickly stabbed the goblin.

Stab.

The short sword was swiftly stabbed into the goblin’s chest.

Chwee.

Afterwards the goblin dropped dead to the ground.

Chwee! Chwee!

The goblins who were behind the first one became enraged at the sudden death of their companion.

Those monsters rushed towards him.

Pull.

Roan jerked out the short sword which was in the chest of the goblin and threw it.

Thump.

The goblins who were running forward couldn’t dodge it and tumbled on the floor.

It was an ideal opportunity.

Roan quickly rushed towards them and stabbed forward with his spear.

The spear stabbed the head of the goblins in succession.

Chwee.

He killed three goblins in an instant.

But even so, his expression wasn’t good.

‘It’s a disaster.’

The palms of his hands was hurting.

Just because he used his spear twice, the skin seemed to be peeling off.

On top of that, it didn’t even have an ounce of strength behind it.

‘I really became a complete novice.’

Roan smiled bitterly and picked up the items which the goblins had on them.

“I’m sorry but I’ll have to take your necks.”

His hand moved at the same time.

Chop.

The heads of the goblins rolled on the floor.

Roan tied up the dirty and rough hairs of the goblin and grabbed them.

Drip. Drip.

Green blood flowed from where the necks were chopped off.

And then the leaves of the mountain shook fiercely.

‘Mmm!’

The wind was was still the same.

‘It’s them!’

If it wasn’t for the wind, then only one option remained.

The other goblins were coming down in search of their comrades.

Roan quickly ran towards the gorge’s exit.

Chwee! Chwee!

Angry noises from the goblins could be heard behind him.

However it was impossible for them to chase him.

He already came out of the gorge and had entered the plains.

He could see Rose Battalion far off in the distance.

Roan shook the thing in his hand.

“It’s the goblins! Goblins are waiting in ambush!”

He shouted loudly but no one heard him.

He was still too far away.

*****

Mason, who was waiting for Roan to come back, frowned when he looked at Roan coming out of the gorge.

“Why is that bastard like that?”

It seemed like he was yelling something, but he couldn’t hear him.

“And what is that thing he is holding?”

It was a thing which appeared to be like a watermelon.

“He seems to have picked up local fruit from the woods.”

Another scout that was next to him spoke with an impudent tone of voice.

Mason looked at him as if it was stupid.

However, as Roan came closer, Mason’s face froze.

Because his yelling was heard more clearly than before.

“It’s the goblins! Goblins!”

Only then did he realize that it wasn’t a watermelon which he was holding, but the head of a goblin.

Mason looked at the other scouts with a dumbfounded facial expression.

‘It’s really a goblin?’

Especially Mason, who was several times more surprised than the others.

‘For monsters to appear in the region of Ale! It had never happened until now!”

He shook his head while he was opening his eyes abruptly.

This wasn’t the time to be like this.

He ran towards the squad following behind them..

“Go, goblins!”

He shouted out with all of his strength.

At that moment, Gale, who was cautious because of Dosen, shouted while his face lit up with joy.

“What?! Is this true?!”

“It is! Look over there!”

Mason pointed at the gorge with his finger.

Everyone’s gaze moved over.

They were looking at Roan who ran while his hair fluttered in the wind.

And a faint voice could be heard.

“It’s a goblin. Goblins are waiting in ambush.”

Gale’s gaze sharpened.

“That thing in his hand is the head of a goblin.”

His right hand extended towards the skies.

“Battalion hold. Battle formation.”

At that moment, all of the captains yelled out orders with of all their strength.

“Battalion hold! Everybody, battle formations!”

“Battle formations!”

The officers yelled out and they each went towards their respective squads.

Gale still looked at the gorge calmly in the midst of the noise.

“Dosen.”

“Yes!”

Dosen, who was nearby, approached him.

Gale pointed at Roan.

“Bring over that soldier. I need to hear his story.”

“Yes!”

After Dosen replied like that, he made eye signals at Mason.

“Yes! I will bring him!”

Mason replied nervously and moved his feet.

‘Damn. Am I the only one that’s going to be punished?’

His face showed a hint of nervousness.

He made fun of the guy who said he was heading out to investigate.

He was absolutely confident that there weren’t going to be any monsters

‘A goblin!’

But the guy he had made fun of appeared with the head of a goblin.

Mason bit his lower lip.

‘I need to coax him well, so that he doesn’t say anything unnecessary.’

His feet that were running towards Roan, sped up

*****

‘Pant. Pant. Pant.’

Roan felt like he was dying.

He ran with all of his strength because he feared that Rose Battalion would enter the gorge, so his chest felt like exploding.

He wanted to rest a little after informing them: that the goblins were waiting in ambush, but he didn’t have any time to do so.

“Lieutenant Colonel Gale is looking for you.”

Mason grabbed Roan’s wrist.

In the end, Roan couldn’t even properly catch his breath and was dragged towards Gale.

At that time, Mason whispered in a low voice.

“Forget everything I said to you back then. Understand? Actually, I also thought that there was a high chance for an ambush. So I was responsible for it, and sent you into the gorge. Huh? Right?”

Roan didn’t even have the strength to answer back.

Mason became anxious when saw that Roan wasn’t showing any reactions.

“Are you listening to me? Huh? Answer me.”

“Whew. Understood.”

Roan let out a deep breath and nodded.

Only then did Mason shut his mouth.

The two of them moved quickly and soon arrived in front of Gale.

“Oh! Come here!”

Dosen exaggerated without any need to.

Roan slightly ignored him and bent down towards Gale.

“What was in the gorge?”

He came straight to the point.

“It’s goblin marauders.”

“The numbers?”

“There were at least a thousand on the left side of the mountain where I searched. Normally, thinking of this when you orchestrate an ambush, you would have another force on the other side of the mountain. So thinking about it, it would be more than 2000, the size of a regiment”

“Mmm.”

Dosen frowned.

Rose Battalion only had 800 soldiers.

It wasn’t even the half of the goblin marauders.

“Are you certain?”

“I am.”

Roan replied unhindered.

Because he had already experienced it in his past life, there wasn’t even a tiny mistake.

“Mmm. What a pain.”

Gale shook his head.

Their numbers was a part of it, but the location where they were hiding is also a problem.

The goblin marauders had already taken over both sides of the mountains. They were in a really vulnerable position to attack from when they were below them.

Then, Dosen interrupted.

“Wouldn’t it be better to march around the gorge and head directly towards Pedian’s Plain? We will be two days late but we can avoid an unnecessary fight.”

Anyways, Rose Battalion’s objective was to reunite with the other squads at Pedian’s Plain and subjugate the monsters together.

There was no need to confront the goblins.

Roan, who was still listening, became surprised and interjected loudly.

“You can’t do that!”

This was because he remembered what had happened in the miserable and cruel past.

First battle End

Chapter 5




‘Damn.’

Roan did yell feeling that he was in a hurry, but he closed his mouth because of this troublesome mood.

Dosen’s face wasn’t happy.

‘Because a soldier was opposed to the idea the adjutant gave.’

Maybe, if the adjutant’s temperament was harsh, a fist would have already smacked him.

However he couldn’t back off like this.

‘If we just leave the goblin army like this, the nearby villages will be massacred.’

In his past life, after the goblins annihilated the Rose troop, they left the gorge while attacking and sacking the surrounding villages – sparing none of their people.

‘It won’t be an easy fight, but we have to destroy the goblin army.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

At that time, Dosen coughed with a displeased face.

“Ahem. What could a barely trained soldier know…… Tch.”

He was clicking his tongue.

However Roan didn’t plan on backing off at this point.

He stared right at Gale and slightly bent his head.

“Commander Gale. Do you know the similarities of the fight in Kali in May, year 176; Mendorf defense in August of 183, Roman’s suppression tactic in October of 185, and the fight in Fiore in March of 191?”

These were battles ranged from 30 years ago at most to barely10 years ago at least, but not too long ago to have been forgotten.

Gale frowned.

‘Similarities?’

At that time, Mason laughed awkwardly.

“Hahaha. This, this bastard. What are you talking about? What’s the Mendorf defense, and what’s the Roman suppression tactic? You picked that up somewhere and are talking nonsense.”

At his words, Dosen added.

“It’s also the first time I’ve heard about those battles. Ahem.”

Their faces were really unpleasant to look at.

He glared with his eyes telling him to stop this nonsense.

On the other side, Roan’s face was calm and imposing.

‘It’s normal for them to not remember fights that aren’t related to our kingdom.’

It was also the same for him.

However, 7 years from now, an unparalleled genius strategist called Ian Phillips, would appear, the study of strategies and tactics boomed.

The generals and soldiers studied the large and small battles throughout history, and Roan also spent some time studying them for a while.

And because of that, he could remember all of the battles that he had named.

But fortunately, Gale could understand all of the fights Roan spoke of unlike Mason and Dosen.

‘The fight in Kali was a fight between our Rinse Kingdom and Estia Empire, the defense of Mendorf was the battle between Estia Empire and Byron Kingdom, the Roman suppression tactic was the fight that happened in Russia where the farmers rebelled, Fiore’s fight was the fight between our Rinse Kingdom and the Monsters.’

Four battles that were different in time, nature, and adversaries.

‘There’s a common point between these battles?’

Roan said in a low voice as he saw that Gale wasn’t getting it.

“Massacre.”

At that moment, Gale’s eyes widely opened in shock.

“Ah!”

A low cry came out.

He nodded as if he was a little excited.

“Right. Massacre. It was massacre.”

The four battles were all different in the adversaries, time, and nature but the winning side had massacred the losers.

“In the battle of Kali, the people from Estia massacred our Kali’s castle residents. In the defense of Mendorf, as the Byron royalty left Mendorf castle and fled, the people from Estia massacred the residents of Mendorf’s castle.”

“Right. In the case of the Roman suppression tactic, the farmers side revealed everything and in turn were massacred. In the fight of Fiore, as our kingdom retreated, the monster army roamed through the region of Fiore attacking seven large and small villages; utterly massacring its residents.”

It was a conversation that dropped well.

Gale looked at Ale’s gorge with a frozen face.

“Then what you’re thinking about…… Is it perhaps?”

Roan slowly nodded.

“Yes. If we leave the goblin army like this, the nearby townspeople will be massacred.”

“Mmm.”

Just looking at the four battles he mentioned, the probability of it happening was high.

Gale looked at Roan with a surprised expression.

‘It was also him that investigated the gorge alone, but even memorized the battles that not even Dosen knew of. What an amazing kid.’

On the other side, Dosen’s face, that was looking away, was clearly contorted.

‘Damn. For someone like me that ate blades as meals for 10 years and not know of it. What’s the identity of this bastard?’

A soldier that ate 20 years worth of blades for meals.

That’s who Roan was.

But of course, there was no way Dosen would know that.

Gale wanted to keep testing the newcomer soldier before his eyes.

“Then, we move after defeating the goblin army?”

“Yes. Only then will the people around Ale’s region be safe.”

“But those Goblin bastards built up a camp in the mountains. We aren’t in a situation where it’s easy to confront them.”

He spoke with the intention of finding out if there was another method, Roan had better quickly share it.

Roan looked at Gale and smiled dimly.

“Do you remember the battle that happened in the Pelan Mountains in February in the year 200?”

The battle in the Pelan Mountains was one that happened just the other year.

Gale obviously nodded and so did Mason.

However, the only person that could read what Roan was thinking, was Gale.

Gale smiled brightly and clapped.

“Ah! Attacking with fire!”

Roan slowly nodded.

“Yes. Attacking with fire.”

The Pelan Mountain Battle occurred in the boundaries of the Pelan Mountains, that was between Rinse Kingdom and Byron Kingdom.

The Byron Empire from back then moved faster than the Rinse Kingdom and occupied the higher ground, but the Rinse Kingdom blocked the entrance and set the mountain forest on fire.

“Right. Back then, the army from Byron left the burning military camp and fled.”

“Yes. As those guys fled to the road we had purposely opened, they were annihilated after we ambushed them.”

At Roan’s words, Gale clapped.

Clap. Clap. Clap.

“Good, really good! What’s your name?”

“It’s Roan.”

“Good, Roan. Your merits today have been really huge. And your knowledge is also outstanding. I will definitely remember your name.”

“Yes. Thank you.”

Roan bowed.

He didn’t ask for a big prize from the start.

Although he discovered the goblins in hiding and proposed a good tactic, he was still a newly recruited soldier.

‘If I accumulate more merits, my rank will go up and I will be able to command my own soldiers.’

He wasn’t planning on acting in a hurry.

But because of that, he also wasn’t willing to relax.

‘I will render great merits in this battle.’

He gripped the spear even harder than before.

Although he didn’t have the same strength and stamina as before, he still had 20 years of experience.

He was confident in facing four or five goblins at the same time; with his current condition.

Then, he heard Gale’s voice.

“Prepare the fire. Make a trap and bait them over there.”

“Yes!”

After Dosen loudly replied back, he grabbed the reins.

He looked at Mason and Roan and swung his hand.

“The soldiers that are in charge of scouting, return to your respective squads.”

“Yes!”

This was Mason and Roan who replied back at the same time.

Dosen glared at Roan for a moment and turned back.

‘Did I get marked by Dosen?’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

Originally, he needed to have cold eyes and a crooked attitude to be considered normal.

However, Roan, who had 20 years of experience eating blades for meals, just saw him as someone cute.

“We will be leaving then.”

Mason bumped Roan and bowed to Gale.

Roan too saluted Gale and went back to the 13th squad.

Along with the sound of steel, a hot excitement could be felt in the atmosphere.

‘Is it the first battle?’

A smile appeared on Roan’s mouth.

That was the smile of a man where expectation and excitement blended together.

First battle (3) End

TL: It seems like there is some mana, mana runes, etc. involved in this novel. So maybe it will get funnier?

Chapter 6




Tane frowned.

‘Damn. A battle unexpectedly.’

He thought that there wouldn’t be any battles until they reached Pedian’s Plains.

Because it was a safe region with no monsters.

‘It will be a pain to take care of the new soldiers.’

The 13th squad was only composed of new enlisted, fresh recruits from the training grounds.

It wasn’t only one thing, or two that he had to pay attention towards.

“Oliver! You take care of the new enlisted!”

“Yes!”

Oliver replied in high spirits and lined the newcomers up, including Pierce in front of him.

They were in a dumbfounded state because of the sudden up and coming battle.

Oliver hit the helmets of the newcomers with his big hands.

Dong! Dong!

“Everybody, get a hold of yourselves! When the battle starts, you only follow my back. Understood?”

“Ye, yes…..”

A feeble reply.

Oliver frowned and hit Pierce’s chest.

Punch.

“Kugh.”

Pierce tumbled and stepped back.

Punch! Punch!

Oliver yelled after continuing to hit the chests of the other newcomer soldiers.

“Reply properly! This is not training! If you don’t grab a hold of yourselves you will instantly die! Understood?”

“Ye, yes!”

Only then came a reply full of spirit.

Oliver nodded with a satisfied face.

Then, a soldier who was in the back intruded.

“Hey you, what……. It’s you?”

He wanted to reprimand him, but at that instant he saw the face of the soldier.

It was Roan returning after having completed his scouting duties.

“You too, grab a hold of yourself!”

“Yes!”

Roan replied with passion and then quickly shut his mouth.

A determined face with shining eyes and a strong will.

He was in no way in a state of nervousness or fear.

‘Look at this guy.’

Oliver looked at Roan with a slightly surprised expression.

‘Also at that time, when he was packing his things, it appears like he was already had experience in doing so.’

However, it was impossible.

All of the five new enlisted soldiers including Roan, were all beginners with no battle experience.

At that time, the sound of the drums rolled out.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

At the same time, the cavalry and archers charged towards the gorge of Ale.

Dududududu.

The sound of the earth shaking.

The other troops followed them.

The cavalry galloped from the left side of the gorges entrance to the right, this caused tremors in the mountain floor and draws the attention of the goblin army.

During that time, the archers prepared to fire.

“Fire!”

At the orders of the officers, the flame arrows covered the sky.

Shoot shoot shoot.

The entrance of the gorge became a sea of fire in an instant.

Burning flames!

The path of fire devoured the peak of the mountain, urged on by the flowing wind.

The only place the fire didn’t reach.

The west side where the archers didn’t shoot at on purpose.

The rest of the squads formed up in there.

“Ro,Roan. Will, will we be fine?”

Pierce called out Roan with a really scared face.

Roan clicked his tongue.

‘For this kind of guy to become the Duke of Rinse Kingdom.’

This coward became a duke.

It meant that the spear skills of Reil Baker were truly outstanding.

‘I also learnt a few tricks.’

Although he wasn’t a formal disciple like Pierce, he too had some things taught.

And with just that, he could climb all the way from the 7th squad spearman to the 1st squad spearman.

‘Although I was only a Lieutenant.’

Spearmanship without the basics was the same as a toothless tiger.

Even if he learnt a really strange spearmanship, he wouldn’t be able to show even a tenth of it.

“Roan, are you also scared?”

Pierce looked at Roan who wasn’t saying anything while blinking.

Roan hit Pierce’s chest and smiled.

“There’s nothing to worry about. You were always first in the spearmanship tests.”

“Tha, that was only in training.”

Pierce’s eyes were at the brink of tearing up.

Roan shook his head.

‘Your talent is a waste. Bastard! Your talent is a waste.’

Even the instructors had said that his talent for the spear, was the best they had witnessed in years.

However, he was too indecisive and timid, so they didn’t know if he was going to be able to use it in real battles.

‘I really admire Viscount Reil Baker.’

He disciplined up this kind of coward – all the way to becoming a duke.

“Just follow my back.”

Roan hit Pierce’s shoulder and glared towards the gorge.

Ale gorge, that one side was now covered in flames.

Dudududu.

The ground shook.

Break.

The trees of the gorge shook roughly and wood fell apart.

Chwee. Chwee.

The goblins poured out at the same time.

“Kill them!”

“Kill!”

Along with the lieutenant’s order, the beating drums rattled through the battlefield.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

His heart thumped and the pressure rose.

Excitement.

At this moment, Roan became the kid who dreamt of becoming a great general.

Then, Tane lifted his spear high and yelled.

“Charge!”

“Charge!”

All of the squad members shouted and charged.

Clash! Clash! Clash!

The sound of metal clashing exploded around his eardrums.

Pierce and the other new enlisted soldiers followed behind the back of Oliver, while forming up their posture nervously.

Compared to him, Roan kept maintaining the ranks in the squad, whilst observing the progress of the battle.

“Damn! They’re a dirty lot!”

Pete yelled after stabbing his spear into a running goblin and cursed.

Roan shook his head.

‘This isn’t the end of the goblin regiment.’

His eyes turned to the other side of the gorge.

‘There is also the other half still hiding. They will come running out to help, once they notice the fire.’

Then, the number of the goblins we are facing will increase.

‘We have to reduce their numbers as much as possible.’

Roan gripped his spear and glared at the goblins.

Then, Tane’s voice was heard.

“They are breaking through. Newcomers in the back be careful!”

“I will take care of them!”

Oliver replied quickly and slashed off the necks of the encroaching goblins.

A reliable appearance.

Certainly, the Rose battalion was an outstanding one.

‘I can’t allow a battalion like this one to become obliterated.’

Then, a goblin appeared in front of Roan.

“No, no!”

Oliver noticed it too late and wanted to thrust out his spear to intercept, but it was too late.

‘Damn! At times like these, the greenhorns become frozen stiff!’

Concerned eyes.

However, Roan calmly extended his spear and pierced the throat of the goblin.

Grr.

A falling goblin.

A cool concise movement in one.

However, Roan’s spear didn’t stop there.

Spat.

The spear twisted like a snake and passed through Oliver’s hip.

His objective was the goblins who were targeting Oliver’s back.

Thrust.

The tip of his spear pierced the chests of the goblins without stopping.

“You, you…….”

Oliver’s surprised reaction towards the spear passing next to him while stammering.

Roan pulled back his spear with a calm face.

“Be careful.”

Short words.

At the same time, he passed through Oliver and stood in front of the new enlisted soldiers.

Swiiiish.

The blade of his spear drew a line of light slashing through space.

‘Where are you goblins going!’

Roan’s spear danced.

Grr. Grr.

Three goblins consecutively fell.

It was obvious of what just happened for the new enlisted soldiers, but he also drew the focus from various eyes of the other 13 squads as well.

‘What is the identity of that guy?’

‘A new recruit without fear at all?’

The soldiers of the other 13 squads looked at Roan, and clicked their tongues.

At that time, Tane who was looking at the situation made hand signals to Roan.

“Roan! You come to the front! The newcomers will be taken care of by Oliver!”

It was a waste to use his skills in defense of the new enlisted soldiers.

“Yes!”

“Yes! Understood!”

Roan and Oliver yelled loudly and charged through.

Roan who ventured along the front with the other 13 squads.

Pierce who was looking at his back, showed a surprised expression.

‘Roan. What happened to you?’

The spear skills he remembered from Roan in training wasn’t that much.

On top of that, he had never acted so bluntly, because he also had a timid side like him.

‘You are like a completely different person.’

In only one day, Roan completely became another person.

Grr.

During that time, Roan’s spear cut off the neck of another rushing goblin.

Chapter 7




There were indeed more goblins than their Rose battalion.

But because those goblins were allowed to escape through a small open road in the west, their numbers became ineffective.

A long shape.

And the Rose battalion surrounded them in the shape of a horseshoe. [Editor note: ( U ).]

“Die! Die!”

“They are breaking through the front! Support them from the left and right!”

“The injured ones, retreat to the back! The injured ones, retreat to the back!”

The goblin forces were also in a state of disarray, but the loud voices who were heard nonstop took our attention.

“Uhhhhh.”

“I, I don’t want to die.”

Half of the new enlisted of each squad were trembling while spacing out.

Among them, the only calm one was Roan.

Thrust!

Roan thrusted the tip of his spear into the head of a goblin.

Meanwhile, the other goblins were also charging at him.

“Hmph!”

Roan snorted and hit the chin of the goblin with the butt of his spear.

Crush.

Chwee.

At the same time, he pulled out the spear which was lodged within the head of the previous goblin, swinging it in an arc, the goblins while falling back felt their necks sliced off.

A natural action, just as water flows down a stream.

‘Look at this guy.’

Tane who was facing the goblins next to Roan, chanced on him with astonishment in his eyes.

He was amazed by Roan’s spearmanship.

However, Roan felt like dying.

‘Damn. I feel like dying because the palms of my hands hurt.’

His palms were really limp.

And because of that, he couldn’t even grip nor swing as he pleased.

Originally, the beauty in spearmanship exists in being able to attack while defending at the same time without stopping.

However, right now, the flow was sporadic with bursts of occasional stoppages now and then.

‘After the battle ends, I will have to focus on training my spear skills.’

He had thought that in his past life, he had quite excellent spearmanship, but even so, being a Lieutenant in the 1st Squad of Spearmen was the best he could achieve.

If he wanted to aim for something higher, he needed better spear skills.

‘To do that, I have to reach the level I had in my previous life as fast as possible.’

Spearmanship he had refined for 20 years in real battles.

All of those things were already in his head anyways.

‘And then travel to the territory of Potter. If I go there……..’

He was planning to go the Potter territory after this subjugation of monsters ended.

‘There’s a future within that place.’

A smile appeared in Roan’s face.

Even then, his spear moved without stopping.

Slice.

The heads of the goblins fell consecutively.

The situation became more favorable for the Rose battalion little by little.

But then, a dust cloud appeared on the other side of the gorge.

‘They are coming!’

Roan’s focus became sharp.

The goblins who were hiding on the other side of the gorge would soon arrive.

Now the aspect of the battle will completely change.

“Cavalry! Cavalry! To the south! To the south!”

“Archers! Nock!”

The orders of the captains became desperate.

The horse shoe line up collapsed suddenly.

“Spearmen hold your positions! Kill the bastards coming down from the mountains!”

“Yes!”

An answer filled with determination.

Although the number of the goblins coming down were many, it wasn’t to the point they couldn’t handle it.

They were in a situation where they were largely spread out.

“Newcomers! Get a hold of yourselves! Now, we don’t have the leisure to take care of you!” Yelled Oliver.

Behind him, a new enlisted soldier that was slightly thrusting his spear was trembling.

They were also feeling it.

That the strong defensive line formation came under immense pressure making it more difficult.

At that time, Roan came into Pierce’s line of sight.

Roan’s appearance of swinging his spear with soft movements while slashing down the goblins.

Each time, the goblins fell to the ground with their throats cut open.

‘Roan.’

A guy who was no different to him until only a day ago.

That guy was making great contributions as if he had become a Ghost of War.

‘For me too…… Will I be able to do it?’

Compliments he heard in the training camps until his ears hurt.

‘Your talent for the spear is the best.’

And in actual fact, he never failed in placing first during any spear tests.

However, if you are placed in front of a monster, your body would freeze stiff.

‘I’m, I’m a coward.’

Pierce’s face became teary.

Then, a goblin charged towards him after having punched through the defensive line.

“Damn!”

Oliver extended his spear late, but it didn’t reach in time.

The goblin who reached Pierce in an instant.

Chwee!

The goblin rushed in on him and screeched something.

But that was all.

Thrust.

The tip of a spear penetrated the neck of said goblin.

“Huh? Uh……..”

The owner of the spear was a half absent minded Pierce.

As his life became under threat, he instinctively thrust out his spear.

The speed of the spear was so fast that the goblin charging died without even knowing how he had been killed by it.

Oliver who was looking at him yelled while smiling brightly.

“You do well! Just keep it up!”

“Yes? Yes…….”

Of course, Pierce still replying in a bewildered state.

‘Do, do I need to do it?’

The feeling when he thrust the neck of the goblin still remained in the palms of his hands.

It wasn’t that hard.

His heartbeat faster while his pressure rose.

‘I, I also have to do it!’

The teary face slowly returned to normal.

Pierce charged through and supported the weakened lines.

At the same time, he slashed his spear at a goblin who was charging into him.

Slash.

The head of the goblin flew off, landing on the ground.

‘Pierce you bastard. Finally grabbing a hold of yourself.’

Roan, who was facing goblins in front with the 13th squad smirked, and shook his head.

Right now, he was a new enlisted soldier which no one recognized, but eventually he will become the man who was chosen as the best talent in all of history within Rinse Kingdom.

‘I can’t be losing to you.’

Pierce was an 18 year old newbie.

He too was an 18 year old newbie in the eyes of others, but he had experience of the past 20 years to rely on, and was a 38 year old skilled spearmen.

Roan’s spear drew a line of light while it danced.

‘But is that bastard still far away?’

As he slashed his spear non stop, his eyes were still directed at the mountains.

There was a Goblin he was waiting for…

‘He was certainly the same size as me.’

The goblin in his memories.

He was the Chief of the Goblin hunting party, and as tall as himself.

Originally, goblins didn’t surpass the chest height of humans.

‘He used dual blades.’

The goblin held swords in both of his hands and roamed the battlefield ruthlessly.

The number of soldiers in Rose Battalion who fell to his hands would be counted in double digits.

Slash.

At Roan’s spear, two goblins lost their heads and fell.

“Good! Keep pushing like this!”

“We take care of this side the fastest, and then march west!”

“Kill!”

The soldiers who rose to the momentum shouted.

At that time, the Goblin appeared in the East of the mountain.

‘He came!’

The Chief of the goblin forces Roan was waiting for.

The atmosphere changed – it was of a general appearing.

Chweee!

It made a rough and angered screeched.

At that moment, the goblins who were being pushed back charged in more furiously.

Just like their hero had finally arrived.

“Wha, what’s that?!”

“Is that a goblin too?”

“Isn’t that an orc? Orc?”

The soldiers of Rose battalion who discovered the goblins Chief were perplexed.

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘It would be better if he was an orc. His skills are a level higher than those of an orcs.’

He wasn’t the Chief in vain.

However, the soldiers of the Rose battalion had no way to knowing this, as each lifted their weapons quickly charging in.

Slash.

The head falling with a horrible noise wasn’t that of the Goblin Chief, but of those from the Rose battalion soldier’s.

“Huh?”

“Huuh?”

At that moment, he remembered the perplexed faces of the soldiers.

‘Right. It’s not easy for normal soldiers to confront it!’

Roan bit his lower lip and made his mind up.

His body moved towards the goblin leader.

“Hey! Where are you going!”

Tane’s voice rang behind him.

‘I’m going to take his head!’

Words he couldn’t say.

Roan’s spear gleamed with the sunlight.

Chapter 8




While Roan was stabbing the charging goblins, the Goblin Chief severed off the heads from various spearmen and swordsmen.

Chweeeee!

A terrifying screech that even robbed the fighting vigor from the battlefield.

And then, the soldiers who were charging into avenge their comrades without hesitating; started to fall back.

The Goblin Chief calmly walked forward oozing out confidence when it noticed them.

Chwee!

A shriek that implied such humans weren’t even it’s match.

The Goblin Chief’s dual blades parted the air.

“Ugh!”

A narrow eyed soldier closed his eyes, when he looked at the blades slicing towards him.

That moment he experienced the certainty of death.

But then, a clashing sound exploded near his ears.

Clash!

At the same time a voice urgently urged out from the edge of death’s looming embrace.

“Fall to the back!”

The narrow eyed soldier slowly opened his eyes and blankly stared in front of him.

The owner of said voice was a spearman with a childish face.

It was Roan.

“Hooo.”

The soldier fell back relieved, as if he was hurried back to the safety of the line while at the same time overjoyed he’d just survived.

After that, a space was created between Roan to swing his spear, he wore a somewhat fishy smile.

“It’s been a while. It’s been 20 years.”

Chwee.

The Goblin Chief contorted his face and shrieked out.

‘Right. There’s no way for you to remember me.’

Roan smirked and charged.

The tips of his spear was moving to pierce the chest of that bastard.

Chwee!

A mocking shriek, as if it was making fun of him.

It swung it’s dual blades lightly and smoothly fended off the spear.

Clash!

‘Kugh. His strength is certainly superior.’

Roan clenched his teeth tightly because of the difference in strength transmitted through to his hands.

If such a strain was prolonged, a not so favorable outcome for me.

‘With my current state, I can only exchange a few blows.’

But even so, the reason he charged in so confidently.

‘I will show you one deadly attack.’

The many spear skills in his memories.

However, he couldn’t use them all.

The strongest spear skill he could only use right now.

‘The three stances Pierce taught me.’

Pierce’s Spearmanship originated from after he was taught by Reil Baker, and invented for the up and coming battles they braved together.

Because they fought normal soldiers, it was still powerful, even if it didn’t consist of mana.

‘I have only one chance. More than that is hard for me.’

Thinking about the state of his palms, the strength of his grip and his physical strength, he could only execute this stance once.

‘I have to look for the perfect opportunity.’

Roan’s spear shook and sliced through the air.

Chwee!

The Goblin Chief displayed an annoyed expression towards the spear swinging towards him without stopping.

It raised his dual blades so high to try and cut off the spear.

The Goblin Chief’s body which was exposed for just an instant.

‘Now!’

Roan gripped harder and forcefuly pulled back his spear.

Rip.

The pain of his palms shredding.

However, Roan’s movements didn’t falter.

Spat!

The spear which was pulled back to his waist, stabbed towards the body of the Goblin Chief.

Chwee!

It became momentarily perplexed, but he snorted in mockery while quickly striking down with both of his blades.

Swing.

Right before the two blades met the spear.

Thong!

The stiff spear bent like a snake.

At the same moment, the spear rose to the skies.

Spat!

The spear swerved pass the two blades and rushed into the neck of the goblin.

Chwee?

The Goblin Chief opened his eyes shocked at the spear bending in an impossible angle.

Stab!

Roan’s spear tip pierced through the neck of the goblin.

Grr.

Choked growling sounds from the falling Goblin Chief.

Roan pulled the spear tip across his throat and frowned.

“Kugh.”

A painful sound was heard.

He looked down at his palms.

A mess.

His skin was peeled off while blood trickled.

His limp palms couldn’t stand the fierce and strong spear skills of Pierce.

‘It’s really a mess.’

Of course, in his past life, he couldn’t execute it more than five times consecutively.

No, even utilising it five times made his entire body ache.

It was a skill that put a lot of strain on your body, but it also was that much more effective.

“Whew.”

Roan looked at the Goblin Chief slumped on the ground and smiled.

Not a bad harvest for my first battle.

Looking at the big hole in his throat, he admired Pierce’s talent even more.

‘For a form created in the middle of idle resting to be this much.’

It was at that moment when he was admiring the difference in abilities.

The form he barely executed after having his palms ripped, Pierce executed it without even shedding a drop of sweat.

‘In this life I will certainly close the gap between us.’

Roan steeled himself while regaining his determination once again, and after chopping off the head of the Goblin Chief, he raised it high up to the skies.

“Spearman Roan from the 13th squad! I cut off the neck of the Goblin Chief!”

A loud voice.

Even if he didn’t do that, the soldiers who witnessed their fight raised their weapons any way and yelled.

“Waaaaaaaa!”

“Roan! Roan! Roan! Roan!”

The atmosphere of the battlefield changed in an instant.

The goblins who lost their Chief, didn’t know what to do.

Their morale was so low, plummeting to the ground, this spread amongst them causing a shift towards looking for ways to flee.

While on the other hand, the morale of the soldiers from Rose battalion surged as high as the sky.

Slice! Chop!

Chwee! Grr!

At the attacks from Rose battalion, the goblins fell without resisting.

After Roan tied the head of the Goblin Chief to his waist, he returned to the 13th squad.

“You bastard! How can you run away as you please!”

Tane yelled at him as if he was waiting for it.

However, there was also a faint smile on his face.

That was because he’d watched the scene of Roan piercing the neck of the Goblin Chief.

Roan bent down.

“Looking at my allies falling down, I just charged in on my own. I’m sorry.”

Tane wanted to say one more thing, but shook his head in the end.

“Be more careful next time.”

“Yes.”

Roan bent his head and fell to the back.

The battle was already ending.

The goblins couldn’t even charge to where the 13th squad were formed.

Roan took out some bandages while looking at the battle.

“Want me to help you?”

A recently enlisted soldier just like him, who had white skin and big eyes asked with a preoccupied face.

Roan lent him the bandages, as he just arrived in time.

“Thanks.”

“Why, with this much.”

The white skinned and big eyed soldier embraced the spear with his armpit and bandaged him.

He bandaged him so meticulously, Roan thought that he would be able to hold the spear again immediately.

‘He is quite familiar……’

He was very familiar.

A feeling he was forgetting something important.

Roan tried to remember who was the man in front of him.

However, the new enlisted soldiers who survived in his past life were only Pierce and himself.

Because of that, he couldn’t remember the other newcomers.

‘But why is he so familiar?’

Roan who fell silent in his thoughts.

Then, the bandaging up ended.

At that moment, his big fingers were caught in Roan’s eyes.

“Ah!”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

“Huh? What happened? Is the bandaging somewhat painful?”

Asking because he was surprised.

‘He’s identical.’

Roan’s eyes trembled.

The silhouette of a person passed by dimly through his eyes.

‘This guy was the oppa of that person.’ [Editor Note: oppa = brother]

The face of a woman filled his entire scrutiny.

Roan shook his head and just put on an awkward look.

He smiled brightly while lending out his hand.

“It’s nothing. Thank you. Glenn.”

The white skinned and big eyed soldier was called Glenn.

He remembered.

Who this guy was, and who his sister was.

Chapter 9




The only person Roan ever loved in his life.

She was Glenn’s younger sister, Selin.

‘She came to find his corpse when he died by the hands of the goblins.’

A 17 year old young woman.

The death of her one year older brother, was a hard one to endure.

‘I was just giving her solace, because of her upset appearance seemed too pitiable.’

They casually started to love each other.

‘Did we date for ten years?’

In his late twenties, he was planning to even marry her.

‘But in the end, we separated.’

The reason was Roan.

‘I couldn’t leave the battlefield.’

Late twenties was a climax age.

He was still too young to give up on his dream of becoming a great general.

On top of that, Pierce was just named as a lieutenant colonel of a new battalion, asked him to join up facing the troubles ahead.

He thought that it would be the last chance.

‘Even her words to him; not to leave, that if he left it would be the end, I still left.’

It took exactly three years before he returned.

And when he returned, she was already a woman of another man.

‘Since then, I lived like a crazy bastard.’

He battled like a crazy person.

And because of that, the normal soldier who couldn’t be seen for 13 years, became Lieutenant in just two years.

But of course, that was the most he could ever achieve.

‘She longed for her dead brother all her life.’

What a relief.

Glenn didn’t die.

She wouldn’t be sad anymore.

‘But if it turns out like this, would I be able to meet her…….?’

Somehow, a bitter flavor roamed in his mouth.

He thought that he had forgotten it all, but now that he remembered it, it wasn’t easy for him to push away those feelings.

‘Perhaps, it is better this way.’

Even if they met up and loved each other again, he would only leave her alone again.

Because in this life, he would dream bigger than his past life.

“It seems like the battle ended.”

Glenn’s voice stated.

Roan pushed away those thoughts and looked towards the battlefield.

There were still some goblins running away, but the battle had certainly ended.

“Squads line-up! Squads line-up!”

The officers yelled with all of their strength.

The battle in the east ended, but the fighting in the west still remained.

The goblins who came pouring out from the other side of the mountain.

‘Well, now that their Chief has been slain, that side will also crumble.’

The Rose battalion was pushing to win without any difficulties.

After a while, the battle ended with an overwhelming victory to Rose battalion just like Roan had predicted.

The time of retrieving the corpses and healing the wounded started.

“The newcomers this time are amazing!”

“Yeah! You were called Roan and Pierce? You killed it out there.”

The 13th squad was filled with lively commotion.

Roan’s and Pierce’s outstanding merits were followed up with positive compliments.

It was rough, but Pete, who evaluated skillful people highly hit Roan’s back.

Hit!

“You bastard! I completely see you in a new light! Hahaha!”

“Kugh.”

Roan frowned and bent his back.

“Ahem. Did I hit you too hard?”

Pete laughed awkwardly and scratched his cheek.

Roan raised his hand as if say it was okay and nodded.

Then, Tane approached him.

“The skill you used to defeat the Goblin Chief. Did you also learn that at the training camp?”

It was a skill he had never seen until now.

At Tane’s curious question, obviously the 13th, 12th and 14th squads who were nearby raised their ears over to listen for an answer.

Roan slowly shook his head.

“No. Because of a certain coincidence, I was able to learn it from a retired soldier.”

“Retired soldier? For spearmanship of a retired soldier to be so much more skilful. They often say that such a world is wide, and there were as many powerful people as there are sands of grain.”

Tane just looked at him fixedly.

“Anyways, you rendered major merits in this battle whilst saving the lives of many people, so I will let it pass this time but……”

“Let it pass my ass.”

A cold voice coldly intruded in.

Both Tane and Roan turned their heads to look at the owner of that voice.

“Captain Dosen.”

Tane bent his head.

Dosen said with a icy expression.

“Roan.”

“Yes.”

“Leaving your ranks in the middle of a battle is a grave offense.”

A stony voice.

Actually, he was already in a bad mood because of what happened before the battle.

‘A newcomer dares to ignore the words of a Captain!’

Because of Roan, only he appeared as a foolish person in front of Gale.

“Even if you had permission from Mason, leaving your ranks while marching is also a grave offense.”

“I’m sorry.”

Roan bent his head.

He knew the reason why Dosen was acting like this.

‘His pride must have been hurt.’

At times like this, it is better to stay amicable.

If he corrected what happened, only the adversary would feel worse.

Dosen continued speaking.

“Rose Battalion’s Colonel let it pass, but it’s something that I, who organize and command the soldiers can’t forgive.”

The soldiers of the 13th squad who were watching the situation couldn’t hide anxious expressions.

“If it was like usual, you would have been whipped 50 times, but taking into account who discovered the goblins hiding in the gorge, and since you also killed the enemy Chief, I will deduct your salary for five months, and add an extra month of training.”

“Yes. I will follow your orders.”

Roan bent down.

Dosen glared at him for a moment, and then rode his horse off; returning to his original place.

Pete looked at Dosen riding further away and asked.

“What kind of accident did you make in the front for you to be punished? How unfortunate, instead of receiving a reward for having killed the enemy Chief.”

Roan just smiled bitterly instead of replying back.

Tane looked at his expression and interrupted the conversation.

“Didn’t you hear Captain Dosen’s words? He left the ranks on his own twice.”

At those words, Pete shook his head as if he didn’t understand.

“No, but even so, I don’t think that it’s enough of a reas…… Now that I look at it, were you also the one who discovered the hiding goblins?”

“Yes.”

Roan slowly nodded.

The soldiers of the 13th squad again absorbed the news with surprised expressions.

“You are really a thing. A thing.”

“Yeah. If it wasn’t for him, we would all have been slaughtered.”

“He’s a benefactor in our lives!”

A rowdy but good natured atmosphere.

The soldiers of the 13th squad purposely tried to raise the mood up for Roan.

However, Roan didn’t care much about that.

‘I won’t be using money much, anyways.’

Actually, it wouldn’t be an issue to obtain large amounts of money if he decided to. He remembered all of the huge events that would happen in the next 20 years from now onwards. There were incidents where they discovered mana runes, mineral mines, ore mines, and lost treasures.

‘If I need them later, I just have to appear before anyone else and make it mine.’

There was no need to gain money immediately.

The extra month of punishment in training was something Roan wanted to request for.

‘Stamina, muscles, skin from the palms of my hands and movements. All of these are a mess.’

Just like he summarized, the level of a newbie.

He needed training.

However, the individual training time was really scarce in group movements.

And in that situation, Dosen thankfully commanded him to have extra training.

‘He gave me much needed time to train my body, so this isn’t a punishment, but a gift.’

A smile appeared on Roan’s face.

Then, the voices of the adjutants were heard again.

“Squad line up! Squad line up!”

The soldiers who were resting all over the place, started to stand up and lined up. Roan too, wanted to line up in the back side of 13th squad, but a familiar voice rang from behind him.

“Roan. You have scouting detail and our role is to guide the way.”

The owner of the voice was Mason.

Roan didn’t move in his own accord and looked at Tane.

“Go.”

Tane swiftly shook his hand.

Roan nodded, and then moved his steps.

As he stood in front, he saw Gale and the officers such as Dosen.

‘Cold.’

Dosen’s eyes were still cold.

As the soldiers who were in charge of scouting gathered together, the Rose battalion started to march again.

Step. Step. Step.

Sounds of marching footsteps shook the ground.

Roan, Mason and the other scouts, entered Ale gorge first.

The gorge which was originally filled with forests, was now a barren smoky hill.

‘This place was filled with corpses before.’

A miserable scene.

However, it is different in this life.

‘I have just made my first step.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘What comes next is more important.’

The moment of opportunities will keep coming.

Each time, he would need to choose the best and alternative option.

But the fortunate thing is that his first option wasn’t bad at all.

Behind Roan followed the Rose Battalion who originally should have been obliterated.

First battle End

Chapter 10




The Rose Battalion reached Ale village without any further trouble.

They encamped near the village entrance establishing long tents.

Roan, once again garners attention from a few people.

“Wow. Look at his hands.”

“It seems like they only teach you how to setup a tent in training camp.”

“Ey. That’s not it. Look at the other newcomers. It’s only that guy who is so skilled.”

The soldiers of the 13th squad talked amongst themselves while looking at Roan, who was the only skilled person from the new soldiers.

“You have to pull more this way.”

Roan helped Pierce and Glenn, teaching them how to put up a tent.

“Thanks.”

The two of them laughed awkwardly and scratched their heads.

Roan didn’t say anything and just focused on setting up the tent.

Bang.

With the last bit of hammering, a huge tent became completed.

“Roan! You are simply the best, the best!”

“A really special one enlisted.”

“Did you see the expressions of the other squads? They were really envious. Kukuku.”

The soldiers entered the long tent with their luggage, while raising their thumbs.

Roan just bent his head without saying anything and then grabbed his spear.

“Where are you heading off to do?”

Tane approached him frowning.

“I’m off to do the extra training.”

“Ah…….”

He nodded along with a low exclamation.

It was punishment assigned by the meticulous Dosen, so he could be watching him from somewhere.

If he skipped for even a day, he would be given an impetuous order.

Tane looked at the spear and shook his head.

“Your palms are in such a mess, will you be fine?”

“I’m fine. Glenn’s bandaging done an excellent job.”

Roan raised both of his hands and smiled.

“Even so, focus on training your strength rather than your spear skills, be aware of Captain Dosen catching you slacking.”

“Yes. Understood.”

“And give me your kit.”

“Thank you.”

Roan bent.

Tane hit Roan’s shoulder like that and entered the tent.

‘Should I run for now?’

Roan stretched softly, and started running while holding his spear.

Clank. Clank.

The armor makes steel noises.

The armor only covered the important parts, whilst also low grade and worn out with many parts rusted away, in fact some even had small holes.

Roan, who was running around the outer parts, saw Dosen.

‘It seems like I really did become targeted.’

Dosen approached him while riding his horse.

“You aren’t just planning on running like that?”

“After running a few more laps I will train my spear skills, and perform strength exercises.”

Roan replied while running.

Dosen nodded and pulled the reins.

Wheee.

The horse slowly stops.

“Train like this for two hours everyday.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan yelled to Dosen’s back, whom was trotting off further away.

“Whew!”

He ran out of breath because he was talking while running.

‘My stamina is really a mess.’

To run out of breath after only running this much.

Roan clenched his teeth.

‘At least, there won’t be any trouble until the plains of Pedian.’

Thinking about his memories, he couldn’t recall anything in particular after the Rose Battalion became wipe out in Ale gorge.

Then, this was the right time to raise his strength and stamina.

Clank. Clank.

Roan’s pace became faster.

*****

The Rose Battalion rested in Ale village for a day and started to march towards Pedian’s plain.

Roan didn’t miss the extra training even while marching.

Not only that, he even participated in the group trainings.

“You will fall like that.”

So much so that Pete even had to persuade him.

However Roan, pushed himself to the limits.

He knew how much strength and stamina he could raise with the 20 years worth of experience.

‘If I come to that point in an even shorter time, I can look for a higher position.’

In 20 years from now will change.

Among that were strength, stamina, agility and skills training.

‘The training 20 years from now is much more effective than in this time period.’

Roan eluded Dosen’s eyes while training his strength, and stamina with the methods from 20 years from now. In having done so, in these short 15 days, his arms and legs became a little harder than before.

But just because of that, there was no one in the 13th squad who recognized the change.

No, there actually was only one other person who noticed these small changes.

“Roan. I think your body became better.”

The person who was blinking with an honest expression was Pierce.

Roan slowly looked at Pierce’s face and sighed inwardly.

‘His sight is really excellent.’

One of the many abilities Pierce had.

He had outstanding sight. No, precisely speaking, he had superb ability to see things.

Just because of that, even if they were in the same situation, place and saw the same people, the information he could perceive was much more detailed.

The ability to see things others can’t.

That was one of the driving forces for his ghost like spear skills.

‘Is there only one day remaining until we reach Pedian’s plain?’

Today was also the last day he could train to his heart’s content.

Roan reported to Dosen and ran out of the camp.

Because Dosen prohibited him from training inside the camp.

If he followed the rumours, it seems like the order came from Gale.

Just because of that, he could only do the extra training outside of the camp in the first days, Dosen came out to check on him.

However, as he recognized Roan didn’t show even a trace of disobeying, he left him alone.

Roan came outside of the camp and stretched his back.

“Whew.”

Maybe it was because it was the entrance of Pedian’s plain, but there was a wide endless plain in front of his eyes.

‘First, running.’

If he didn’t want to become injured, it was important to warm your body.

Roan started to run towards the plain.

The weeds which were as long as his waist, swayed with the gentle winds blowing from the west.

The sensation of plants rubbing his skin tickled his ears.

Roan was enjoying the strange feeling, while running to a farther distance out than he’d usually go.

“Did I run out too far?”

The entrance of the camp was too far back and could only be seen in the distance as really small.

He changed directions and started to run towards the Rose Battalion camp.

The weeds shake because of the blowing soft breeze.

Movements and sound that’s no different from before.

However, Roan frowned.

‘Something’s weird.’

His eyes became more focused.

The movements of the weeds, which are in his left side were swaying and rustling.

Roan gripped his spear.

‘There’s something!’

He glared at the direction of the weeds which was swishing roughly.

Stab.

Then, the the weeds parted to the left and also to the right.

Roan stopped the spear moving forward to stab by instinct, and frowned.

Because the things which appeared out of the weeds were out of his expectations.

‘What are they doing here…….?’

Travias spear End

Chapter 11




“Hyung!”

“Oppa!”

Snuffling voices.

Children who were around 10 years old.

Five little kids tightly grabbed Roan’s leg while weeping.

“Save our mom.”

“Boohoo!”

Tearful cries loudly burst out over the sound of the wind.

Roan patted the heads of the children awkwardly.

“What happened?”

Toning down to a softly considerate voice, at least the biggest girl looked up at Roan.

“Some bad guys came to our village. They, they took away mom and dad. Boohoo!”

The girl couldn’t hold it anymore and started to cry.

Roan patted her head and frowned.

‘Bad guys?’

He searched his memories.

But there was no particular case.

‘Originally, the Rose Battalion were annihilated, and didn’t pass through here.’

It meant that it was completely unrelated to him.

Roan looked at the crying little girl and asked gently.

“What’s your name?”

“Sob. Sob. Lia.”

“It’s a nice name Lia. Tell me Lia, are you the oldest here?”

Lia sniffled while wiping her tearful face with both of her hands, and nodded.

Roan pointed towards the Rose troop camp into the distance.

“If we head over there, this place will have a lot of tough uncles. Will you go there with me, and tell them what happened in your village?”

“Then, those uncles will save our mom and dad?”

Clenching her hands, from deep within her eyes could be seen a glimmer of hope.

Roan couldn’t ignore that hope.

“Well. Of course.”

Only then did the sobbing children stop crying.

Roan started to walk towards the camp in front, while guiding the children.

“Roan!”

Before he could even enter the camp, a scary yell was heard.

It was Dosen.

‘This bastard dares to come back late after idling over there?’

Dosen came outside because he was thinking that perhaps…

He was planning on punishing him if he was idling around without him knowing about it.

However, he couldn’t discover Roan in the nearby area at all.

‘Right. You were well caught.’

Deserters receive punishment of having to live in hiding for life.

He thought that Roan wouldn’t be so stupid as to fulfil such punishment, and instead he would be hiding somewhere.

What kind of punishment should he hand out, it was at that moment when he was thinking such things, when he saw Roan coming into the camp.

“Just where have you bee…… Huh?”

He was about to yell at him when he saw the children lined up behind him.

Dosen frowned and looked at Roan.

“Who are those kids?”

“It’s……”

Roan explained everything that happened in a calm manner.

Dosen’s face contorted.

“Someone attacked the village and took away their parents?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan nodded with his mood darkened.

‘He wouldn’t be making up an excuse, right?’

It was Dosen who didn’t feel good towards him.

If he resorted to violence in vain, only the children would be at a loss.

Dosen whom was thinking for a while, hit Roan’s shoulder.

“Good. Take the children, and head to Lieutenant Colonel Gale.”

“Yes?”

Roan asked with a surprised expression.

Dosen’s eyes twitched.

“It means that innocent villagers are in danger. So we need to rescue them.”

“Ri, right.”

Roan laughed awkwardly and nodded.

Dosen said it as if he was just revealing it.

“You thought that I was going to resort to violence?”

Roan didn’t talk back.

Dosen looked at the children, who were about to cry at any given moment, and continued saying.

“It’s true that I don’t like you. But I’m also a soldier of Rinse Kingdom. As a soldier, it’s my duty to protect the people of the Kingdom.”

Roan just nodded instead of replying.

Dosen smiled at the kids once, and moved towards the camp stables.

“Kids. Let’s go.”

Roan made sure Lia and the other children followed behind his back.

When they walked further in the camp, Commander Gale approached them with a well disposed smile.

“Oh dear. These little kids are having it really hard.”

He sat Lia, the other children and patted their heads.

The children being seated just like little chicks was really cute site to see.

Gale ordered the soldiers to bring hot milk and bread.

“Eat slowly.”

A gentle voice.

The kids were staring at their surroundings, and then quickly grabbed the bread.

Munch.

The children started taking big chunks with every bite, as if they were really hungry.

Gale just looked at them.

Lia, who finished her bread, drank some milk while looking at Gale.

“Is Uncle the leader here?”

“Right. Uncle is the leader.”

Gale nodded along with a bright jolly laugh.

Lia returned the cup, and asked with a begging expression.

“Then, are you going to save mom and dad?”

“Yes. Of course.”

Gale nodded and carefully continued to say.

“However, you have to tell me what happened in the village. Can you tell me?”

At his words, Lia nodded.

“We were playing hide and seek in the woods, when about 20 dangerous, and Big Uncles appeared. And suddenly…….”

Tears trickled down her big eyes.

Gale softly wiped off her tears with a handkerchief, and carefully asked.

“Did those uncles kill the townspeople?”

Lia nodded.

“The Chief, Uncle James and Uncle Michael all died.”

Thick tears trickled down.

‘These small ones went through such a thing.’

Gale thought with regret, but still continued to asked another question.

“Then what happened?”

“The Big Uncles tied the people with a rope, and took them. We were still hidden in the bushes when it happened.”

Gale nodded with an admirable expression.

“You did well. Really well. Uncle will ask you two more things. First, what village does Lia live in?”

“Hotton village.”

“Hotton village……?”

Gale frowned.

‘It’s not familiar.’

A village he never heard of before.

Then, that meant it was a really small village.

“Then, the last question. Where did the Bad Uncles go with the village people?”

Lia thought for a while and answered with a confident voice.

“To the East, they went to the East towards Trum village. They certainly went that way.”

“Mmm.”

Also an unfamiliar place.

It’s a high possibility that it was also as small as Hotton village.

‘Then, even Trum village may be in danger.’

Gale frowned and stood up.

“What do you think?”

Dosen, who was listening next to them, replied in a voice so low, so the children couldn’t hear it.

“Aren’t they Thieves or Slave Merchants?”

“There is a high possibility.”

Gale nodded and grabbed Dosen’s shoulder.

“Captain Dosen.”

“Yes.”

“I will leave this to you. First, find some soldiers who know about Hotton village and Trum village. Take five cavalry patrols and chase them down, capture if possible, or eliminate if not.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Dosen slightly bowed his head.

At that time, Roan who was observing the situation, slightly raising his right hand.

“Lieutenant Colonel Gale.”

Gale looked at him, as if what to ask what happened now?

Dosen also was the same.

Roan looked at the both of them and continued to hurriedly say.

“I know about Trum village.”

At that moment, Gale and Dosen both looked at him with surprised expressions.

“You know about Trum village?”

Roan slowly nodded.

‘Trum village… How can I not know about it.’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

‘Because that’s where the Travias spear is located.’

The Travias spear, which was about to be discovered in 17 years from now.

‘Even if that wasn’t the case, I was planning to go there after the subjugation of the monster horde ended, and afterwards head towards the Potter district.’

However, he was unfamiliar with Hotton village.

On top of that, there was no other case he remembered aside from the Travias’s spear event.

Then, he heard Gale’s voice.

“Good. Then Roan, you will take the role of scout.”

A situation that every minute was precious.

It was much faster to take Roan, rather than asking around all of the other soldiers.

Dosen approached Roan, and grabbed his shoulders.

“Do you know how to ride a horse?”

“Yes. I know.”

“Good.”

Dosen nodded with an astonished expression.

There weren’t many normal soldiers who knew how to ride a horse.

However for Roan, who dreamt of becoming a great general, slowly learnt cavalry riding skills.

‘I also rode the horse for 10 years.’

He couldn’t say whether he rode it skillfully, but he was at least on a level he didn’t fall off.

“Then, we will be heading out.”

Dosen bowed towards Gale while riding out of the camp.

Roan quickly followed his back.

‘It’s something which I didn’t experience in my past life.’

Chills ran down his spine.

A completely different feeling compared to when he confronted the goblins in Ale gorge.

On top of that, the opponents weren’t monsters, but humans.

Roan clenched his teeth, and gripped his spear.

‘Let’s hope that this choice is followed by good results.’

Travias’s spear (2) End

Chapter 12




Clop clop.

The steady noisy clopping sounds.

Dosen, who obtained permission from Gale, took five patrols of Cavalrymen from the First to the Fifth sections.

These soldiers heard about the story regarding the children, and volunteered to forgo their free time. When they first heard about a novice enlisted from the spearmen squad, whose role was to scout for them, they became concerned.

‘Will he be able to ride a horse properly?’

However, it was all in vain.

‘Is he really an 18 year old novice soldier?’

The gazes of the cavalrymen fell on the Roan’s back, who was riding in front of them.

‘It’s a lie, right? It seems like he’s riding the horse better than us?’

‘What kind of spearman rides a horse better than men from the cavalry?’

The soldiers from the cavalry truly admired him.

They stuck their chests closer to the horse, and urged their horses to gallop faster.

Dudududu.

The thunderous galloping noise shakes the earth wildly with it’s furious pace.

A hundred cavalrymen ride across the plains.

Roan guessed where Hotton village should be, based on his past knowledge of where Trum village was located.

‘She said that Trum village was in the east of Hotton village.’

If Lia’s words were true, then there was only one place where Hotton village should be located.

A humble area located near the entrance of Pedian’s plain.

‘There’s nothing more important than water.’

Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the horse.

The west winds freshly breeze, made him feel like it was rubbing his back.

‘Our destination isn’t Hotton village, but the middle point between Hotton village and Trum village.’

If it was according to Gale’s, Dosen’s and his guesses, then the guys who attacked Hotton village would be travelling to Trum village.

‘If my memories don’t fail me, there should be a thick forest in the west of Trum village.

Roan’s eyes shone with calculating thoughts and hoped that he was right.

‘To rescue the villagers safely……..’

He bit his lower lip and pulled the reins.

The head of the horse swerved towards the east.

Dosen, and the cavalrymen who were following behind him, also pulled their reins.

However, there was no one who questioned this change or displayed weird faces.

‘It seems like those bastards are in front of here.’

They trusted Roan.

No, they could only do so.

Because they didn’t even know what kind of place they were riding to.

The chase continued for a long while.

After they passed the bushes which were as tall as their waist, some small hills, a small thick and densely forest appeared.

The cavalrymen rode through the thick forest roughly.

Then, Roan who was charging ahead fiercely, pulled the reins and lessened the pace.

“Captain Dosen.”

He reined in his horse to a stop, dismounted and turned back to look at Dosen.

“What happened?”

Dosen approached him while still mounted on top of the horse.

Roan pointed to a hill which was outside of the forest.

“It seems like we’ve caught the tail end of those guys.”

“Mmm.”

A low exclamation of amazement.

“We finally caught them.”

The place Roan pointed towards.

There was the bastards they wanted to see so much.

Dosen made hand signs to the cavalrymen who were behind him, and dismounted from his horse. They tied the horses in the trees behind them, and hid behind some big bushes.

“There are roughly about 50.”

At Dosen’s words, the 1st squad Lieutenant Karon frowned.

“There are estimated to be about 100 captured people. It seems like they are Slave Merchants.”

The 2nd squad Lieutenant Pierson, clenched his fists.

“And it doesn’t seem like the only village attacked was Hotton.”

At his words, everyone nodded.

Dosen’s face became dark looking at the slavers.

“If we just attack them like this, the village people will be in danger.”

There was also the probability that those Slave Merchants would escape leaving the village people behind. But there were also cases for the opposite option to occur.

Where they could threaten the lives of the village people as hostages, and they can’t do a thing.

“Is there a method to rescue the villagers safely?”

Dosen asked while looking at everyone else.

However, among the hundred plus soldiers, no one could come up with a clear plan.

In that time while discussing options, the Slave Merchants disappeared into the other side of the hill.

“Captain Dosen.”

Then, Roan carefully raised his hand.

‘It’s you again?’

Dosen looked at Roan.

Every time they were pushed into a difficult situation, this guy came up with an idea.

In the investigation of Ale Gorge, the battle plan against the Goblin Marauders. And now, this time too.

‘The results were good.’

Now that the situation turned out like this, Dosen could expect something.

“Yeah. It seems like you have a good method?”

“I don’t know if it’s any good, but I do have something.”

“Speak.”

Dosen was prepared to listen.

And all the other cavalrymen also listened attentively.

Roan took in a breath and continued to say with a self-controlled voice.

“There’s a huge forest in the west of Trum village. It’s a forest with a lot of trees. We reach there before them and ambush them.”

“Ambush?”

Dosen frowned and asked back.

Roan nodded.

“Yes. We hide in the forest, and when the Slave Merchants moved past us, we hit them with a surprise attack, cutting a line in the middle between both village people and them.”

It was a good strategy.

If it turned out that way, they could save the lives of the village people, and also kill the Slave Merchants.

However, there was a big problem with this plan.

“It’s a good strategy. However, will we be able to enter the forest before them?”

There was only one road.

To overtake them was impossible.

At Dosen’s words, every cavalrymen looked at Roan.

Roan drew in the ground with a branch.

“Look here.”

First, he drew two circles.

“The left circle is Hotton village, and the right one is Trum village. Our position is here, and those bastards position is over here.”

Roan made two points between the existing two circles.

The Slave Merchants were certainly closer to Trum village.

“If you look at it this way, it certainly looks like they can reach Trum village swiftly. But actually, they can’t.”

Roan drew a horizontal line between Hotton village and Trum village.

“It’s the Abyl stream. Although it is unassuming, it’s quite wide and deep, so it’s impossible to cross it.”

Roan made a point in the lower side of the horizontal line.

“There’s a bridge in here. They will need to cross this bridge and enter Trum village. It’s a road that is quite long.

Karon frowned.

“That’s the only road that leads to Trum village?”

At his words, Roan smiled and nodded.

“Most people only know about this road.”

At that moment, Dosen’s eyes shone with expectation.

“What you are saying right now, sounds like you know of another road?”

Roan looked at Dosen’s eyes and replied.

“Yes. I know of another road. A much faster one at that.”

At that moment, everyone’s mood lifted.

“Good! Then it won’t be a problem to overtake those bastards!”

“We will be able to ambush them.”

The cavalrymen clench their fists excited and approved it.

‘What’s the identity of this guy?’

Dosen became surprised once again.

This region was one that he, and even Lieutenant Colonel Gale was unfamiliar with.

But for an 18 year old recently enlisted soldier, whose just finished his training to know of a shortcut – too mysterious.

‘As far as I know, this guy isn’t even from this region……..’

The more he knew about him, the more surprises he encountered.

‘I will have to properly talk with him.’

A feeling Roan was hiding something from him.

He was really curious, but right now, he didn’t have the leisure to ask Roan about that.

‘First, let’s save the village people.’

They had to take care of the Slave Merchants first.

The thing with Roan came after that.

“Fine. Take the lead.”

Dosen stood up and grabbed the reins of his horse.

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan replied while at the same time, all of the cavalrymen mounted their horses.

Clop. Clop.

The horses weren’t heading to the east, but instead to the north.

As soon as they were out of the forest, a large hill appeared.

Dudududu.

Roan urged the horse and galloped towards the hill.

The opposite direction to where the Slave Merchants were heading to.

‘There’s a shortcut here.’

Dosen and the cavalrymen stick their chests closer to the horse.

The one hundred soldiers galloped furiously while cutting through the wind.

After they rode for a while, the scenery changed.

The hills disappeared, and a lengthy course of a river appeared.

Whine.

Roan pulled the reins in and stopped out front of the flowing water.

“It’s the Abyl stream.”

Dosen who approached him called out.

“I wouldn’t believe it if you told me it was a stream, as it resembles more of a river instead.”

He looked at his surroundings and said.

“Where’s the shortcut?”

Roan pointed towards the Abyl stream with a calm face.

He said something they didn’t want to hear, nor want to believe.

“We will cross through this Abyl stream.”

Chapter 13




“Are you kidding right now?”

Dosen became annoyed.

He remembered quite well Roan’s words.

‘It’s Abyl’s stream. Although it is a stream, it is quite wide and deep, so it is impossible cross.’

He had certainly said that it was impossible.

But now he was saying that they should cross it.

“You know that we don’t have time to be joking, right?”

Even at this moment, the Slave Merchants were still approaching Trum village.

“Of course.”

Roan dismounted off the horse while at the same time he replied.

Dosen looked directly at Roan’s eyes.

“Then are you really saying that we are going to cross this stream?”

“Yes.”

At that moment, Dosen’s and the cavalrymen faces anxiously contorted.

Although it was calm, this stream seemed certainly to be deep and wide.

If they didn’t have a floating bridge, then it was impossible.

‘Only now does he make trouble.’

Dosen gritted his teeth.

‘If we turn to chase them now, won’t we be able to catch them?’

His head swirled at a loss.

At that time, Roan grabbed the reins of his horse and waded into the stream.

Splash.

He moved along the riverbank and stopped in one place.

Dosen looked at that and frowned.

“What are you doing right now?”

Roan replied with a calm and imposing voice.

“We are going to cross this bridge.”

“Bridge? Where’s that bridge?”

Dosen frowned.

Roan waded further in towards the stream.

Splash.

The water filled up to his waist in an instant.

“Five years ago, a bridge used to be here, in the place I’m standing right now.”

Dosen’s face turned red.

“Are you telling me, that we should cross a bridge which disappeared?”

Roan shook his head.

“The bridge is still here.”

A confident voice, and an imposing face.

Dosen frowned.

“What does that mean?”

Roan smiled faintly and replied.

“The bridge is still here. Only that the water in this stream rose.”

“Ah…..”

At that moment, a low exclamation of understanding flowed from the mouths of Dosen, and the other cavalrymen.

Roan continued speaking.

“This bridge is beneath the water level. But fortunately, it’s still fine. If you walk precisely along here, you will be able to cross this stream safely.”

He pointed at the calmly flowing Abyl stream.

Dosen and the cavalrymen looked at Roan with a surprised expression.

‘How does he know about this?’

‘Is this a place he’s visited before?’

‘Even if this is the case, how is it possible he knows of a bridge that’s under water?’

Many questions popped up through the gathered soldiers.

Roan shrugged his shoulders and urged his horse on across the stream.

“Are you going to keep standing there?”

“Ah!”

Only then did Dosen and the cavalrymen grabbed ahold of themselves, quickly dismounting their horses.

They grabbed the reins and stood in front of the riverbank.

“The bridge is really slippery because it’s deep under water. And there may even be some broken parts. You have to tap it with the tip of your spear and cross it slowly.”

Roan moved the spear in his right hand.

Everyone gulped down dry saliva and nodded.

“Then, I will take the lead.”

Roan took in deep breaths and waded further across the underwater bridge.

Ziip.

The underwater rock bridge’s surface felt slippery under his feet.

He tapped the submerged bridge in front of him with the tip of the spear, and slowly moved his feet. And the water soon reached his waist.

‘It’s fine. That previous time, it even reached up to my chest.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘There’s no need to be nervous. You already crossed it once.’

17 years from now, Roan crosses this underwater bridge with a person he thought to be a friend.

‘Son of a bitch.’

That bastard, he thought of as a friend.

Now that he thought of his face, he started to curse him.

‘The guy who snatched the Travias spear from me.’

Roan had made many wrong choices in his past life, but the worst of them was entrusting the spear to a person he thought of as friend.

‘That bastard took this spear to the Byron kingdom, and received a title of a Count.’

That guy roamed the battlefield with the spear, and received the nickname called Spear Ghost.

‘Even so, he didn’t become a match for Pierce, who was called a Spear God.’

Thinking about it like this, he once again felt Pierce’s might.

Splash.

The water which reached his chest washed his thoughts away.

‘Let’s focus on crossing this stream.’

Roan gathered a hold of himself again and waded step by step.

Splash. Splash.

The west wind, which blows freshly across the stream; raises little waves.

Roan, and the one hundred cavalrymen anxiously crossed the Abyl stream, discipline finally overcoming nervousness.

If someone who didn’t know about this saw it, they would think that the Abyl stream was really shallow.

‘The moment I reach the other side it ends.’

The people who were crossing the stream felt, that they were on top of a death rope.

The apprehensive time flowed slowly.

Step.

Roan was the first to reach the riverbank.

Drain.

His body was really drenched.

Pheew.

The war horse shook its head and body.

The water drops splashes everywhere.

“Kugh.”

Roan turned his head and shakes his hands.

Meanwhile, Dosen and the cavalrymen slowly reached the riverbank.

They were as drenched as him.

They wanted to dry out the water in their clothes, no, in the armor and the weapons but they didn’t have the leisure to do so.

Dosen quickly mounted the horse, and grabbed the reins.

“Let’s see the scenery next time.”

“Yes.”

Roan replied shortly and after he mounted his horse, he started to ride in the front.

Dudududu.

A galloping sound that shakes the earth.

The cavalrymen grabbed the reins and bit their lower lip.

‘It’s done now.’

‘We caught up with those bastards.’

They stick their chests to the horse and kicked it.

Dudududu.

The hundred cavalrymen gallop towards Trum village.

*****

“Wow, the trees are really dense.”

“Yeah. Not even sunlight passes through.”

Joey and Luce traveled through the narrow forest road, and checked their surroundings.

It was so eerily quiet that it even became gloomy.

They grabbed the reins and looked back.

The fifty plus allies followed behind them with their horses.

Joy’s and Luce’s gazes moved beyond their allies.

“Hehehe.”

A laugh suddenly erupts on itself.

The people who were tied just like wrapped fish.

The rope which was tightly tied to the wrists, and the waists followed through to next person.

And like that, the people who were tied walked with their heads low.

Even at first glance, the number surpassed the hundreds.

“We should have to come to this region in the past.”

“Yeah. There’s no security, nor hunters. Kukuku.”

Joey and Luce looked at each other while laughing.

They were the heads of the Slave Merchants who operated in the western parts of mountain areas.

“It was a pain to confront Hunters in the western parts of the mountains.”

Joey smacked his lips and shook his head.

The temperament of the Hunters in mountain regions were really fierce, and their skills were really good, so it wasn’t easy to confront them.

Because of that, every time they enslaved people, they escaped with a loss.

In the end, Joey and Luce left the mountain regions, and ventured through the plains, which was in the middle-north of the Kingdom.

“If we capture this many slaves every time, we will become wealthy in no time.”

“Kukuku. Let’s buy a residence in the capital.”

They talked like that and kept guiding the horses.

Clop. Clop.

Clopping sounds break the silence of the forest.

Next to the narrow forest road, the thick woods opened up.

The woods rustled with the wind.

Pheew.

One of the horses of a Slave Merchant jibbed, shaking its head and makes rough skittish movements.

“Why are the horses like this all of a sudden?”

“Yeah.”

Joey and Luce pass through the woods and pat the head of their horses.

Then, a bush which wasn’t swaying with the wind shakes roughly.

Paat!

Inside the bush, a long spear stretches out.

Stretch!

“Kugh!”

“Ugh!”

Many Slave Merchants who were riding horses became pierced in the sides and fell.

Whine!

The horses which became frightened raised their front legs and skittish neighing ensued through out.

“Wha, what is it!”

“What’s happening!”

Joey and Luce looked back and yelled.

Shang!

The remaining Slave Merchants unsheathed their swords from their waists.

A different group appeared from the bushes, as if they were waiting for it.

They rushed in and formed a defensive wedge between the Slave Merchants, and the tied up people.

“Who, who……..”

The people who were tied gasped in small voices.

The one who was in the front of these people smiled brightly and replied.

“We are from Rose Battalion, 7th Division of Rinse Kingdom. We’ve come to rescue you!”

The owner of that voice filled with a strong resolution was Dosen.

“Ah!”

“We, we are saved!”

The captured people smiled joyously and yelled.

On the other hand, Joey’s and Luce’s faces contorted darkly.

‘Damn! People from the Kingdom!’

‘Where the hell did they come from?’

Joey frowned, and moved one hand stealthily.

He felt the bow which was in the saddle with the tip of his fingers.

‘I fire off an arrow and escape.’

The 50 subordinates would buy time for him.

Grip.

Grip.

Joey grabbed an arrow, and quickly nocked the bow.

At that time, a crushing sound was heard near his ear.

Splutter!

A horrible sound.

The flying speed in which the spear pierced through Joey’s head.

“Huk!”

Luce who was next to him, looked at Joey’s crushed head.

Split.

At the same time, another group appeared after splitting through the bushes.

“Whew. Fortunately, it hit.”

A teen who laughs after letting out a short sigh.

He glanced at the dumbfounded Luce, and pulled out the spear from Joey’s head.

Crush.

Joey’s head which still had half of it’s shape, became completely crushed.

“Resist or surrender?”

A youthful voice, as if he was secretly asking.

‘The decision will be made by adjutant Dosen anyways.’

The teen then smashed Joey’s head with the butt of his spear.

It was Roan.

Chapter 14




The situation changed.

The captured people were freed and the Slave Merchants replaced them instead.

They scanned the many cavalrymen appearing before them, and lost all of their fighting spirit. More than anything else, looking at Joey’s head ruthlessly smashed in had the biggest effect.

“We have to take these guys to Bason town.”

Dosen looked at the Slave Merchants and frowned.

Bason town, was the only one which had the right facilities to imprison these guys around this area.

Perhaps there would be more, but that was all the information he had.

“Patrols from the 1st to the 4th, will separate with me. Our task will be to take these bastards to Bason village.”

“Yes!”

The lieutenants replied as one voice.

Dosen looked at the lieutenant of the 5th squad, Ched.

“Ched. You take the village people to Trum village.”

An exhausted expression could be seen from many villagers.

They needed a break first.

Ched worried about this with a troubled expression.

“I don’t know the exact position for Trum village.”

“You can ask directions from the vill……”

Dosen talked up to there and closed his mouth.

The village people couldn’t take the role of guiding.

‘I can’t do anything about it.’

Dosen’s eyes look at Roan.

“Roan”

“Yes.”

Roan, who was taking care of the condition of the villagers, answered and approached him.

“You travel together with the 5th Patrol.”

“Yes. Understood.”

At Dosen’s words, Roan bowed.

A smile appeared.

‘I will be able to proceed and locate the Travias spear.’

If he was to travel towards Bason village together with Dosen, he would then have to leave the spear for afterwards.

‘Well, it wouldn’t matter anyways.’

The Travias spear would only be found after 17 years, anyways.

Of course, the one who had found it back then was himself.

Soon, Dosen and the cavalry patrol under him took the slavers, and rode towards the north. When they couldn’t be seen anymore because of the dense forest, Ched called Roan.

“Roan. You take the front.”

“Yes.”

Roan replied shortly and jogged to the front.

It was obvious for him, but the other cavalrymen also didn’t ride their horses.

They had loaned it to the village people, whose conditions were not that good to travel.

Clop. Clop.

The sounds of the horses cantering steps was heard nicely.

They traveled out of the dense forest, and after walking out for a bit more, they finally spotted a little village in the base of a hill.

“It’s Trum village.”

Roan said after turning back to look at Ched.

“It’s smaller than what I initially imagined.”

Ched seemed to be surprised at the village he saw.

‘And because of that, no one could think that the Travias spear would be in a place like this.’

Roan smiled bitterly and moved his feet.

As they approached the village, some guys with huge solid bodies appeared.

“Who are you?”

They seemed to be surprised at the presence of soldiers who were armored, and bearing arms before the village.

“Hello. I’m a Lieutenant of the 5th Cavalry Patrol in Rose Battalion, which belongs to the Rinse Kingdom.”

He shook his hands and explained everything.

“Ah! For that to…….”

The guys became surprised and quickly regretted their defensive attitude.

They guided them inside the village along with bright smiles of relief.

“We will prepare you something to eat.”

With the order from the Head of the village, a few women swiftly prepared food and drinks.

They knew that if it wasn’t for the Rose Battalion, they would also have been enslaved by the Slave Merchants.

“We are really thankful. Really thankful.”

The people who sought safety after entering the village; conveyed thankful messages of gratitude towards the soldiers from Rose Battalion.

“No, no. We only did the obvious thing.”

Ched shook his hands and smiled brightly.

In that time, Roan met Lia’s parents and told them about the things Lia had done.

“You are saying that the reason we were able to become free was because of little Lia?”

“Yes. Lia asked our Lieutenant Colonel to rescue the village people. She is really clever and a brave kid.”

At Roan’s words, Lia’s parents expressions changed to those of relief as their worries disappeared while seeming to hold all the happiness in the world.

Tears trickled down from their eyes.

Ched’s voice was then heard.

“After a break for one hour, we shall return to the Battalion.”

At his words, Roan stood up.

He approached Ched and whispered in a low voice.

“I have not visited Trum village in a really long while. Can I reminisce and sightsee around the village for some time?”

“Really?”

Ched nodded.

‘He should be familiar around this parts, because he has already come here before.’

And there also were the merits Roan had accomplished, so he pleasantly permitted him.

“Come after you slowly had your look around.”

“Thank you.”

Roan bent his head and moved his feet towards the inner side of the village.

‘Small villages like this one won’t change much even after a long while.’

He had visited Trum village after 17 years.

But the Trum village from back then wasn’t that much different to the Trum village he was seeing right now.

He pretended to be looking around the place, and moved towards the north.

‘It’s really amazing.’

Roan reminisced after looking at a huge ancient tree, which was outside of the fences in the north side.

The tree was so thick that three men had to surround it by holding hands, and it was twice as tall compared to the other trees.

On top of all this, every time the wind blew caused the branches and leaves to collide, it tickled his ears.

Feeling strange.

Roan placed his hand on the ancient and huge tree in front of him.

A rugged feeling.

Roan moved around it while still tracing his hand along the ancient tree’s surface.

Touch.

In the tips of his fingers, he felt a fine bump.

‘It’s here.’

Roan’s eyes shone.

He touched the bump with the tip of his fingers and drew closer to the tree.

He scratched the tree with his fingers.

At that moment, a piece of wood fell into his palms.

A piece of wood, that was as long as an adult arm.

On the exterior surface, it seemed to be an ordinary piece of wood, but actually it was a really solid piece of stone.

Roan moved his hand into the place the piece of wood fell from.

A secret place inside that ancient huge tree.

What was hidden inside of that, was a strange shaped oxidized stick.

‘I found it.’

Roan stashed that stick in his waist, and returned back the fallen piece of wood in the ancient tree.

Along with a grinding noise from the stone, the tree trunk recovered its original shape.

Roan evaded the curious looks of other people and sat down by another tree.

A stick that was smaller than an adult’s arm.

It was as thick as a wrist, and although it was originally black in colour, now that it was oxidized, it’s colour now was seen as a bright red.

‘The Travias spear that was said to be made from a dragon’s magic metallic scale, Dionium.’

Roan grabbed the end of the stick and squeezed it as if he was twisting laundry.

“Ugh.”

His face turned red while veins popped up on his wrists.

After he put in all of his strength for a long while, a strange sound was heard.

Creeaak.

The sound of the oxidized parts breaking.

The tip of the spears separates in half and turns.

Clink.

Along with the sound of saw blades grinding, the tip of the spear separated.

Cheeng.

At the same time, the sound of metal was heard and a blade of a sword raised out.

Excluding a handful of length, sharp blades raised all around the stick.

Just like looking at a blade without defensive systems.

However you look at it, you couldn’t really see it as a spear.

‘It’s useless if you don’t know how to use mana on Travias spear.’

Only by inserting mana does this guy show its original appearance.

Roan smiled bitterly and twisted the tip of the spear in the opposite direction.

Cheeng.

Along with the sound of metal grinding, it returned to being a stick which was covered in bright rust. Roan stood up from the place with a satisfied expression.

‘Wait for a moment. When I learn how to use mana, I will use you without sparing a thought.’

He put the Travias spear in his waist and smiled.

Roan’s view was directed towards the south.

‘Potter district. If I go there, my life will change.’

However, now wasn’t the time for it.

If he went now, it would be meaningless.

‘Let’s wait until summer.’

Until then, he needed to bulk up his body while quelling the monsters in Pedian’s Plain.

It was better to keep accumulating merits and garner a more stable position.

‘I still remember the subjugations of the monster horde in Pedian’s Plain freshly.’

A battle which was really fortuitous in accumulating merits.

At least, he would be able to obtain a promotion to Corporal or Lieutenant.

‘Good. Step by step, let’s walk it diligently!’

Now, he won’t make stupid choices.

In his past life, those stupid choices accumulated and he lived a mess of a life.

At that time, one thought passed through his head.

“Ah! Now that I recall it, that guy was also there!”

Chapter 15




While you live life, there are a lot of choices you regret making.

And Roan had made a lot of those choices.

‘That guy was the same as me.’

A quite handsome looking face with blonde and brown hair.

The guy with a slim build and quick body movements.

‘Harrison.’

The spearman from the 7th squad of Thorn Battalion, was really close with Roan.

That guy also enlisted at the age of 18 like Roan, and battled until he was 33.

‘He died by an arrow in the battle of Dems.’

Harrison, who died exactly five years before Roan.

There was also something he regretted even more before he died.

‘If I had only become an archer instead of a spearman.’

That guy entered as spearman and battled his way as a spearman for ten years.

He didn’t have any outstanding skills, but even so, it wasn’t lacking.

However, the arrow he fired by coincidence completely changed his life.

‘I didn’t know that his archery skills would be so good.’

Nobody knew.

Harrison himself didn’t even know.

He became a Lieutenant after having utilizing the bow for only one month. After one year had passed, he became a Captain in the 7th Division of Black squad.

After two years passed, he became the best archer in the 7th Division.

People raised their thumbs up after they witnessed the astounding ability he had with firing arrows. While at the same time, they also said some bemoaning words.

‘If only he had grabbed the bow at a younger age, he would have been the best archer on the continent.’

And that also remained as an immense regret for Harrison.

‘I will make him the best archer in the continent.’

Roan remembered the face of his old friend, and bit his lower lip.

He also wanted to give him a new lease of life.

‘If it’s him, he will become a good ally.’

To become a Monarch, no, if he wanted to become a Great General, he needed to have good allies and subordinates under him.

Roan could vaguely figure out, who would become good allies to a certain degree.

‘For now, is it Pierce and Harrison?’

Pierce with the best talent for the spear, and Harrison with the best talent for archery.

Just thinking about it, no doubt, this was a good combination.

‘But even so, it would be difficult if my abilities fall short of anything.’

Roan started to walk towards Ched, and the cavalrymen while clenching his two fists.

He couldn’t also just live this life with only that much of an ability as a spearman.

‘If I can, I should become the strongest and best person. Including all matters like skills in spearmanship, archery, swordsmanship……. And if the strategies and tactics are perfect, all the more better for it.’

Many memories filled his head, which enabled him to do all of those things.

He only needed to work hard.

An intense effort without stopping.

“We are moving out!”

Ched yelled after he mounted his horse.

Roan followed behind him and gritted his teeth.

‘The monster horde subjugation in Pedian’s Plain is a really intense battle.’

Surprise attacks, night raids, ambushes and fire attacks caused such mess all over of the battlefield.

‘I must render great merits and retire for a while.’

If he wanted to travel through the region of Potter, it was an unavoidable choice.

However, he couldn’t just retire as he pleased.

He had to render enough merits which will grab the attention of the troop commanders or the general’s.

‘Let’s think about that when we return back.’

The fortunate thing was, that he already left quite a good impression on Lieutenant Colonel Gale.

Thinking about many things, the cavalry squad finally reached the camp of Rose Battalion.

Dosen and the other cavalry patrol squads still haven’t come back.

“You’ve done well.”

Gale, who received the report, gave a new order along with a satisfied expression.

To take the children safely back to their parents.

“Oppa, are mom and dad really safe?”

“Of course. They are resting well in Trum village right now.”

Roan calmed down the children and rode with them out of the camp.

When they returned to Trum village again, the sun was almost setting down.

“Lia!”

“Mom!”

A little girl runs towards her mother’s embrace.

Many reunions between the parents and their children happen all around.

Ched patted Roan’s shoulder while looking at that.

“We are fighting, with our lives on the line to protect that. Right?”

Roan nodded silently instead of replying.

“I’m really thankful. Thank you.”

“Oppa! Thank you!”

The former captured villagers, together with the children gathered around them, and lowered their heads. A content and proud smile appears on the faces of Roan, Ched and the other cavalry patrol of 5th squad. When they started to give them food to express their gratitude, they quickly mounted their horses.

“Eat it with the children.”

Ched left them with a few cool words and urged his horse forward.

Roan and the 5th cavalry patrol followed behind his back while waving their hands towards the children.

‘Let’s not forget this feeling. The reason why I’m trying to become a Great General, and a Monarch is not solely for me to eat and live well. It’s for everyone to live happily.’

His objectives became a little burdensome.

Now he wasn’t only planning on becoming just a Monarch, but a good one.

It will be hard, but not impossible.

‘I will be able to achieve it if I work hard as hell.’

Determined light shone in his eyes.

There was confidence, and a determination that he could accomplish it.

*****

Dosen and the other cavalry patrols returned only after a day had passed.

Gale had already organized everything before they came, and at the same time, mobilized the army. But of course, he didn’t forget to compliment Dosen and the cavalry patrols.

“Roan.”

While they were moving, Pierce approached him.

“Huh?”

“I’m curious about something.”

Roan looked at Pierce’s big eyes and nodded.

Pierce continued talking with a bright face.

“Pedian’s Plain is an important place even for our Kingdom, so how could monsters frequent there?”

Pierce’s words were true.

More than half of the crops harvested in Rinse kingdom grew from Pedian’s plain.

So it was difficult to believe, that there would be monster hordes invading such an important place.

“Those monster hordes gather in Pedian’s Plain to look for things to eat.”

The monsters who suffered hunger during winter at the boundaries of the Kingdom, invades Pedian’s plain in spring merely to look for food. A real pain in the ass for the Rinse Kingdom. Only by subjugating the monster hordes, it would allow the farmers, not to miss the season for harvesting crops. The reason behind that is when it becomes spring. Every year there would be a large scale monster subjugation in Pedian’s plain. At that time, Pete who was one step in front of them, butted in with his comment.

“You sure know the situation really well.”

Roan simply smiled.

Pete continued to talk with a more serious face.

“This year’s subjugation will be especially much more harder for us. Do you know why?”

At his words, Pierce shook his head.

‘For a guy who doesn’t even know why monsters appear in Pedian’s plain, that’s a much more difficult question.’

Roan put on a bitter smile.

He looked at Pete’s eyes and replied.

“It’s because two months ago, the Byron Kingdom succeeded in subjugating the monster hordes.”

“Oho.”

Pete exclaimed with a surprised expression.

Then, Pierce butted in.

“And why so? What does the monster hordes subjugation of Byron Kingdom, have something to do with it?”

The reply came from Pete’s mouth instead of Roan’s.

“Those guys from Byron Kingdom pushed the monsters towards the south. To our side of the border.”

Roan continued saying.

“The monsters who were forced back, came to our Rinse Kingdom. And because of that, the number of the monsters who would gather in the Pedian’s plain will become much more.”

“Ah…….”

Pierce frowned and let out a low exclamation.

“The guys from the Byron Kingdom are bad guys.”

Roan didn’t refute him and just shrugged his shoulders.

For Byron Kingdom, pushing the monsters away instead of annihilating them was much easier to do, and they suffered less casualties.

However, Roan didn’t say such words.

‘Even so, it is true that we are at a loss because of them.’

At that time, the sound of a drum was heard from far away.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The Rose Battalion had finally reached Pedian’s plain.

Large and small camps were extended without end within the plain.

“Wow.”

“It’s amazing.”

Pierce, Glenn and the other new enlisted soldiers exclaimed.

On the other side, Roan’s eyes was still calm.

‘First, it is important to know what area the Rose troop is stationed at.’

Only then will he be able to guess the things that would happen from now on.

Roan’s view fell to the west of the plain.

‘It would be better if it was the West…….’

He was familiar with that place.

He clearly remembered where the nest locations, and the monster camps were, even to the extent of when those things movements to and from where.

‘Because in my past life, I fought there.’

At that time, the Rose Battalion still marching, changed directions.

‘As expected……..’

Roan looked to the place where they were heading and bit his lower lip.

Chapter 16




‘It’s not ideal, but it should be the next best thing.’

The place Rose Battalion was heading towards was a little to the southwest of the front lines.

Although it was unfortunate he couldn’t perceive wherever all the battles against the monster horde were in this area, but even so, this place was much better compared to the east.

‘On top of that, this place seems to be relatively safe, but actually it’s no different from the frontlines.’

The Rose Battalion officers assumed that this place was isolated from the frontlines, however this would change in four days. No one knew right now, but the monsters were charging to Pedian’s plain with a formation shaped like a horseshoe. [ Ed: ( U ) ]

‘The attacks will start in the north.’

With quite a lot of numbers on top of that.

So because of these attacks, the Commanders of the Division moved their troops to the north.

And thanks to that, the middle then becomes vulnerable.

The monster horde charged through the center, pushing from the east and then the west, as if they were waiting for it.

‘From that moment, this place will also become the front lines.’

Roan gripped his spear with strength.

‘Firstly, it’s important to know, if the monster horde subjugation tactics from our forces happened exactly as the same as in my memories.’

It would be difficult if he came all the way here, and things happened differently from his memories. His eyes calmly close.

*****

Could he call it luck?

The monster horde subjugation tactics this time, was exactly the same as in his past life.

‘It has been four days since the main forces marched north.’

If his memories didn’t fail him, tonight; the monsters would appear in the plain’s from the west and then also push from the east.

‘If I just leave it like this, the battalions farthest to the east will become annihilated.’

It was important to accumulate merits, but it was also important to not let people die.

‘I have to announce the appearance of the monsters.’

The method was simple.

He just had to make up a simple ruse.

Roan gripped his spear and started to walk out of the tent.

“Extra training?”

The voice of Lieutenant Tane.

Roan slightly nodded.

“Yes.”

“Are you also planning to run around the west of the plains?”

“I’m thinking to.”

At Roan’s reply, Tane nodded and shook his head.

“I will be going then.”

After a short salute, he walked at a brisk pace; heading out of the camp.

Whoosh.

The smell of the battlefield tickles his nose.

Roan saluted the squad members with his eyes while passing the camp lines.

He saw the plains in front of him.

‘It will also be the last time I see this scene.’

Now, hell will be unleashed in this place.

Roan took in a deep breath and started to run lightly.

He passed the camps of many squads and went to the south of the plains.

Swhooosh.

The trees and weeds swayed, slightly shaking because of the west wind.

A refreshing aura is released by the forest.

‘Those guys were hidden beyond this forest.’

Clever monsters.

Roan spent some time around here and once he gathered enough details, quickly returned to the camp where Rose Battalion was based.

His anxiousness face was filled with urgency.

“Lieutenant Colonel Gale!”

He didn’t even attempt to find the squad officers, but instead directly sought the battalion commander. After that last incident with the Slave Merchants, Gale placed more attention towards Roan. It wasn’t enough with directly calling him out to speak, but even visiting the 7th squad.

‘Because of you, only we have it difficult.’

Pete scolded him a little, but in Roan’s position, Gale’s interest was more appreciative.

“What happened?”

The soldiers who were guarding Gale’s tent, frowned.

“It’s an important matter.”

Roan still trying to convey the urgency from his expression.

The guards also knew about the things Roan achieved up until now, so they couldn’t just ignore him.

“Wait for a moment.”

One of the guards entered the tent and came back.

“Go in.”

“Thank you.”

Roan lowered his head and entered the tent.

“Oh! Roan. There’s an important matter?”

Gale, who was working on his table, asked while smiling brightly.

In the other side, Roan still put on an act of urgency.

“It’s the monsters. There are monsters in the west side of the plains.”

Gale immediately stood up.

Bang.

The wooden chair topples behind him.

Gale looked at Roan while frowning.

“Monsters? Are there really monsters in the west?”

Roan bit his lower lip and nodded.

“Yes. It seems to be a large scale one.”

“Ma, maybe…….”

Gale’s face still frowning weighed the information he just recieved.

Roan nodded and continued saying.

“They are probably planning a surprise attack, aiming for our vulnerable middle.”

“They sure will.”

Gale nodded and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“You have brought me really important information. If we were careless, our forces would have taken a blow.”

He believed in Roan.

Because in the past few days, he held several conversations with him, and came to realise how much of an outstanding soldier he was.

And because of that, he couldn’t just ignore him.

“First, I will have to send the scout team and determine their exact locations. Can you show them?”

“Of course.”

Roan nodded.

Gale smiled brightly and patted his shoulders.

“Good. Then, I’ll make you take charge of the scout team.”

He called the adjutants and had them quickly gather the scouts.

‘This guy again?’

‘Is his skill good, or his luck really that good?’

‘How can he discover monsters everywhere he goes?’

The officers stared at Roan with mixture of surprise and resentful looks.

‘My face will become full of holes. With all these sharp gazes on me.’

Roan smiled bitterly while keeping his head down.

“We have finished gathering the scout team.”

A rescuing voice.

Roan bowed towards Gale and the officers while quickly leaving the tent.

‘Is he a lucky guy? A lucky guy indeed.’

Gale looked at Roan’s back displaying a satisfied smile.

“Then, I will have to meet with the Colonel.”

“Are you already intending to make a report? Why don’t you wait until the scout team returns with confirmation first?”

The delaying question of a hesitant officer.

Gale shook his head.

“It’s a simple report. I just have to inform them of a scout team I sent out, because of suspicious movements.”

Victory and defeat in a battle could also be determined with these small reports.

Gale strode out of Rose camp leaving behind his uncertain officers.

The officers who were in the camp let out a sigh while shaking their heads.

“Isn’t he relying on words from only one soldier?”

“On top of that, he’s a greenhorn soldier.”

“He’s just lucky.”

Pouring out complaints with their dissatisfied voices.

In the midst of all that, Dosen was just amicably sitting there with his mouth shut.

‘That he was lucky? I wonder sometimes. I don’t think perhaps that’s the case.’

A faint smile appears in his mouth.

*****

“Sh.”

Roan hid in the weeds and put his finger on his lips.

The scouts who were following him also lowered their bodies.

Quickly they passed through the forest, reaching through to the plains below the hill.

Swhooosh.

The weeds which were as tall as their waists gently swayed because of the blowing west wind.

At first glance, a peaceful scenery.

However, Roan pointed out the monsters while hiding his body within the weeds.

“An amazing number.”

A senior scout veteran amongst the soldiers; Benson quietly approached.

He had also discovered the monsters while hiding in the weeds.

“They will probably also be hiding until the end of the plains.”

Roan pointed to where the hill was elevated.

Benson nodded and vaguely finished counting.

“At least, there would roughly be five thousand.”

Roan nodded instead of replying.

‘It’s true that there were only five thousand from the first night raid. But after that, the numbers would increase significantly.’

The monsters were currently surrounding Pedian’s plain in a shape of a horseshoe.

As time passes, their numbers skyrocketed.

‘It’s because of those bastards from the Byron kingdom.’

Benson’s voice was heard again.

“When will they attack?”

“It’s likely to be tonight without a doubt.”

Roan said so full of conviction within his voice.

Benson frowned.

“How so?”

“They are hiding their bodies within the weeds without even preparing a camp. It’s because there’s not much time left until the attack.”

“Then, they can attack immediately?”

Benson seemed a bit preoccupied with that evaluation.

Roan shook his head.

“They are too exhausted to do that.”

“They are too exhausted?”

“Yes. They should have rushed here without stopping, just to carry out a surprise attack on our exposed center.”

It was the truth.

Just like the monsters who were making an uproar in the north, these same monsters were also located from the north a few days ago.

“Originally, they should have taken place in the north of the plain in this shape.”

He brought both of his fingers to face each other and made a horizontal shape.

Continued by that, taking the point where each of the fingers touch, he bends his fingers to make the shape of a horseshoe.

“However, right now, it’s in this shape. The place where my fingers touch is the north that’s facing the main forces of our army, and the rest have surrounded us from west to east in the shape of a horseshoe.”

Benson let out a low admiring exclamation.

“Ah! The monsters who were in the north rushed to the east and the west.”

“Yes. Taking into account the time, they should have charged here without even having been able to sleep.”

At Roan’s words, Benson’s voice becomes lower.

“Good. Then, it’s certain that they will attack tonight. We have to report this to the Commanders, and prepare for the surprise attack.”

At his words, Roan didn’t say anything.

‘No, that’s not a good method.’

His eyes roamed across the monsters hiding within the weeds.

A chilly light can be seen within his eyes.

‘What we need right now is not defense, but attack.’

Chapter 17




“So you are saying that there are at least five thousand, right?”

Gale, whom returned after a brief report, frowned at the story relayed by the scout team.

“Yes. They will probably make a night raid at sunset.”

Benson reported the story, just like how he had heard it from Roan.

He even made the horseshoe motion with his fingers.

Roan glanced at that and smiled bitterly.

‘There are bastards who try to take away your merits wherever you go.’

In his past life, he had always suffered from those kinds of people.

But now, it was different.

‘I am taking my own merits.’

Meanwhile, Benson finished talking and had bowed his head.

“That’s why we have to prepare for the night raid.”

“Mmm.”

Gale frowned and fell deep into his thoughts.

Then, Roan stood forward to the front.

“Lieutenant Colonel.”

“Hmm?”

“Rather than preparing for a night raid, it’s more beneficial for us to attack immediately.”

“Immediately?”

As Gale queried back, Roan continued speaking without even a trace of hesitation.

“Currently they are in a really exhausted state right now. There’s no need to wait for them to recover. On top of that, if more time passes, the number of the monsters will increase, significantly. Because they will also be more moving towards here from the north without stopping ethier. On top of all…….”

He glanced at Benson once, and made the horseshoe shape with his fingers.

“We have a camp within this Pedian plain area right now. Due to this, the rear part, which is the south is now open.”

The horseshoe slowly closes.

“If we just allow the monster horde to move like this…….”

The palms of his hands met each other.

The horseshoe shape now became a circle.

Roan showed his hands to Gale and continued speaking.

“We will end up being surrounded.”

“Mmm.”

An indication of understanding comes from Gale’s mouth.

‘It’s not only now, but he also predicted the things that will happen from then on.’

He nodded and stood up from his place.

“Roan.”

“Yes.”

“The words which you just stated until now, will you be able to repeat it in front of the Lord Colonel of 7th Division?”

An opportunity.

Roan forcefully gulped down the laughter that was trying to come out.

“Of course.”

“Good. Then let’s go report it to the Colonel.”

As Gale walked one step ahead of him, Roan followed his back.

The face of Benson who he had glanced at, was so screwed up, it seemed like he’d just chewed feces.

‘That’s why if you are trying to steal the merits of others, you have to steal it perfectly.’

As Gale and Roan walked out of the tent, the officers let out a sigh.

“For a greenhorn to already meet the Colonel.”

“Yeah. I still haven’t seen him until now.”

“Isn’t that bastard most likely to be swiftly promoted, if he keeps up like this?”

They didn’t feel good.

Then, they saw Benson who was standing there without knowing what to do.

“Benson, are you becoming similar to that bastard called Roan?”

“What bullshit did you say about the monsters attacking us in a horseshoe shape, but instead, we just have to prepare for their attack?”

“Why is the military discipline like this nowadays?”

Benson lowered his head with annoyance towards the reprimanding of the officers.

‘Damn. I should have just kept my mouth shut.’

Even if he regretted it, it was pointless.

The end result of a choice made was to bare the consequences of one’s own losses or gains.

Benson made this choice of trying to steal the merits from another; ended in huge failure.

*****

“It’s reasonable.”

Aaron Tate, who was from the aristocracy, and at the same time; also Lord Colonel of the 7th Army Division, rubbed his chin and nodded.

‘It’s truly amazing for a novice.’

When Gale first brought the new enlisted soldier to his attention, he was quite disinterested.

But the moment he heard the story from that guy, he couldn’t hide his amazement.

A novice soldier was reading the flow of the battlefield, and also the overall war.

But just because of that, he couldn’t show his emotions for the time being as a representative of the aristocracy. He continued speaking still with a disinterested manner.

“It will certainly be more effective to sweep them up this time.”

Aaron gathered the battalion commanders.

“Monsters have appeared in the west area of the plains.”

He then told them the story he heard from Roan, and revealed the attacking tactics.

“Send this notice to the other Divisions, and prepare for battle as soon as possible.”

“Yes! Understood!”

The battalion commanders replied with one voice.

Aaron’s view turned directly to Roan.

“And you.”

“Yes!”

Roan replied while showing his good military discipline.

Aaron nodded with a satisfied expression.

“When this battle ends; I will bestow you a fitting reward according to your merits.”

“Yes! Understood!”

It was just as he hope for.

Roan followed Gale and walked out of the Lord Colonel’s tent.

“You must also quickly hurry and prepare for battle.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan replied as they rushed to Rose camp together.

“Why did you arrive so late today?”

As soon as he entered into the 13th squads camp, Tane approached.

Roan put on a bitter smile and replied.

“You should all prepare for battle.”

“Prepare for battle?”

Tane frowned while questioning back.

All of the soldiers who were enjoying their free time stared at Roan.

Then, a loud voice outside of their camp was heard.

“Lieutenants gather! Lieutenants gather!”

At the words of that voice, Tane frowned.

“Did you discover something again?”

Roan laughed awkwardly and replied shortly.

“Monsters.”

*****

Hoo. Hoo.

Hot steam wobble the weeds.

Thousands of soldiers move slowly with their bodies lowered.

Swooosh.

Shaking weeds.

Adjutant Jack, who was leading the spearmen, raised his right fist.

At that moment, the spearmen who were advancing while holding their breaths stopped in their tracks, planting their defensive formation.

Swoooo.

The west wind swirls across the plains.

The plain which extends below the distant hill.

Between the swaying weeds, they could see monsters who were deeply sleeping.

Gulp.

Everybody gulped dry saliva.

A nervous moment.

A heavy silence weighing upon their shoulders.

Adjutant Jones, who was leading the archers, raised his right hand.

Tense.

The sound of the arrows nocked, while wood twists as the body of the bow bends, the archers then drew their bows fully back and pauses for a moment to aim.

Jones looked at the officers of other squads.

Then, his hand which falls forward while he focuses at the targets in front.

Spat.

Jones’s hand also cuts the air.

Shoot shoot shoot shoot!

Across 20 Battalion forces, arrows upon arrows are released from a hundred squads at the same time.

Two thousand or more arrows cover the sky.

Sweeeee!

A sharp shrill cry that pierces your ears.

The rain of arrows drenches the ground.

Hit hit hit hit!

“Kugh!”

“Kohong!”

“Grr!”

The monsters whom were sleeping without knowing anything let out surprised cries.

Sweeee!

A rain shower of death falls again.

Dududududu.

At the same time, a thunderous sound rumbles across the ground.

Roan glanced behind him while lying on the ground.

The cavalrymen were now charging forward while cutting through the wind.

Behind them, a white dust cloud surges upwards.

Puuuuuuu!

The sound of the horn trumpet declaring the start of the battle.

Dududududu!

The cavalrymen galloped passed the infantry and charged forward.

The heavy armour of the cavalrymen cuts through the wind.

Booom!

A uncompromising charge, as if they were planning to destroy everything that was in their way.

The cavalrymen charge through to the grounds where previously a rain of arrows fell.

Booom!

“Kuhong!”

“Keee!”

The monsters were trampled on in every direction, along with their cries of despair.

“Attack!”

Jack, who was glaring at the front, stood up and yelled.

“Attack!”

“Attack!”

The spearmen whom were holding their breaths, all stood up and yelled a warcry.

And Roan was also among them.

“Attack!”

He yelled with all of his strength, and charged through to the front.

Among the dust cloud which was raised by the cavalrymen, they could see the resisting monsters.

Grip.

With a surge of adrenaline strengthening his hand.

All spearmen together, Roan included, charged through the dust cloud.

Chapter 18




‘The weather is fucking good.’

A veteran, 35 year old Tarem looked at the blue sky while lying flat on the ground.

‘Damn. To have suffered a complete defeat from those humans.’

He touched his hard chin and frowned.

A long and terrible blade scar below his chin.

‘If the blade had stabbed in at least one centimeter deeper, I would have died, alas all I have as a memory is this scar.’

Grind.

He grits his teeth.

‘Bastards from the Byron kingdom…….’

His four canine teeth shine acutely.

‘I will certainly take my revenge, laying my honor of being an Orc Warrior on the line.’

The orc warrior Tarem, who came from Crack territories located within the south of Byron kingdom. Forced into an absolute defeat at the battle against Byron kingdom last winter. And because of that, he and his fellow clansmen could only flee to the south. When he thought that all was lost, he met that orc.

‘High Chieftain of the Orc Alliances, north of Rinse kingdom: Rak.’

Rak gathered the monster tribes, and the orc clans which were spread throughout the northern parts of Rinse kingdom, and was preparing to raid Pedian’s plain. The validity of the monsters and the orcs uniting to attack Pedian’s plain, especially the northern parts of Rinse kingdom; was something even Tarem heard about. Rak had vowed to assist the outstanding warrior Tarem.

‘If you attack Pedian’s plain together with me, I will assist with attaining your vengeance on those bastards from Byron kingdom.’

A tempting proposal.

Tarem had grasped Rak’s hand without any further hesitation.

After receiving his orders he rushed towards the southern parts of Pedian’s plain, leading his clansmen along with the additional forces Rak had loaned him.

‘We raid the human villages in Pedian’s plain, secure food and weapons.’

When they’ve acquired an ample amount, they will then return to their ancestral territories, and exact vengeance on those humans from Byron kingdom.

This was Tarem’s goal.

When his burning thoughts of vengeance towards Byron kingdom simmered.

‘Huh?’

He heard a strange sound.

Sweeee.

The sound of something sharp splitting through the sky.

Tarem raised his head while still lying on the ground.

“Ugh!”

At that precise moment, his eyes widen in disbelief as if it were about to pop out.

The black arrows covered the blue sky.

“Damn!”

Tarem grabbed his shield covering his body while he crouched behind it.

“It’s the enemy! The enemy is here!”

A voice roared.

Sounds of abrupt rousing was heard everywhere.

However, the actions of these creatures who just woke up from their dreams were sluggish.

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

The rain of arrows drenches the ground.

“Kugh!”

“Grr.”

Moribund sounds rolled across the plains.

The rain of arrows continued once more.

And after that, a trembling sound as the ground shook.

Dudududu.

As he glanced his head over his shield, he glimpsed the incoming charge of cavalrymen before the dust cloud.

“Prepare for battle! Prepare for battle!”

He yelled with all of his strength, but the orcs and monsters couldn’t think straight.

‘Damn! For us to suffer from a surprise attack instead!’

Tarem clenched his teeth, and unsheathed his well polished chinese war sword.

“Bring it! You filthy humans! I will show you the true strength of an Orc Warrior!”

A strong bellow shakes the battlefield.

Hit hit hit hit!

The cavalrymen charge through while furiously trampling the monsters.

“Ugh!”

Tarem slashed his war sword towards a cavalryman who was passing next to him.

Swish.

His sword slices through the horses head, cleaving it into two parts.

Heeng!

The cavalryman whose fierce charge through was really well executed, tumbled to the ground.

Tarem leapt through the scattered dust cloud, charging towards the dazed cavalryman on the ground.

“Die!”

The tip of his war sword slashes down through the air.

“Kugh.”

The cavalryman couldn’t even evade it and just closed his eyes firmly.

Then, a spear appeared – passing through the dust.

Kang!

A clear sound of jarred metal against metal.

The war sword bounces off; after it is deflected by a spear.

“Kugh.”

Tarem clenched his teeth, and turned his head towards the owner of that spear.

A childish face and a mildly short physique.

At least, for Tarem, he seemed to be but only a novice.

“A fucking child dares to interfere!”

Tarem spun his war sword and slashed it down fiercely.

At that moment, the spear which was placed firmly bends like a stream of water and pivots horizontally.

“Hup!”

Tarem astonished, gulped air at the unexpected movements while quickly raising his shield to block.

Tang!

The spear collides with the shield, and a heavy throbbing noise is heard.

The spear which bounced off the shield spins and diverts to Tarem’s back.

“Damn.”

Tarem crouched down to evade the spear.

However, the movements of the spear still continued to flow like a stream of water.

‘His face is that of a young novice, but his skills are truly that of a veteran!’

Tarem hurriedly took a breath of air, and then charged through.

‘I just have to get inside his range. Then you’re mine, boy!’

The spear is long.

And because of that, it is effective in mid to long range weapon combat, but it was difficult to use it in close range.

Spat!

The spear slides through after slicing Tarem’s wrist.

‘Kugh.’

He felt a sharp pain, but he clenched his teeth determined to endured it.

‘I just have to close the distance!’

A bold charge.

Because of that, he could close the distance to what he needed.

No, it was even closer to what he wanted.

And this was because the novice was also charging forward towards him.

“Huh?”

The human who suddenly appeared in front of him.

Tarem became perplexed at the distance, which made it even harder to swing his war sword.

At that time, a sharp tingling feeling was felt within his chest.

He slightly glanced down to look at his left chest.

Embedded there was a short sword the size of his palm; stabbed through to the hilt.

“Fu, fuck. Impossible.”

Curses coughed out.

Tarem raised his head in disbelief, and looked into the eyes of that novice spearman.

That young novice smiled brightly, and then turned his short sword twisting it.

Kugugu.

The sound of his rib bones grinding as his heart was torn to pieces.

“Kuaaaaaa!”

A bellow escapes out from Tarem’s mouth.

Hit.

The novice spearman kicks Tarem’s abdomen with his right leg.

And the short sword which was stabbed in his chest slides out as blood splatters out.

Fall.

Tarem who fell to the ground.

Light disappears from his eyes, and the clear blue sky slowly fades darker.

‘Am I going to die?’

Then, a sharp spear flies through his eyes.

‘Fuck.’

The curse he couldn’t spit out, rolls in his mouth.

Stab.

The spear pierced Tarem’s face accurately.

The owner of that spear, the novice spearman mumbled with casually.

“To call me a fucking novice. To a person whose roamed the battlefields for 20 years.”

Novice spearman.

This was no other than Roan.

‘We are winning a one sided battle.’

The flow of the battlefield favoured the side of the subjugation forces.

The army of five thousand monsters, which was composed of orcs and goblins, still couldn’t regroup themselves to mount a proper defensive formation.”

‘I can’t relax back here.’

Just because it was a one sided affair, it didn’t mean that he couldn’t accumulate merits.

He also had to show something which would stand above the others.

‘On top of that, this isn’t all of their army.’

Grip.

Roan gripped his spear and charged through.

Tat!

He charged through the chaotic battlefield.

Spat!

The spear pierces through the air, weaving and dancing.

The spear stabs or slashes the monsters without stopping.

Attacking and defending.

The beauty of spearmanship which allows you do both of those things at the same time.

Roan was fighting without rest in order for his spear skills to improve naturally.

Slash! Stab! Spat!

“Kugh!”

“Kgh!”

“Kek!”

The blade of the spear slices, while the tip of the spear pierces.

For those opponents who were closing in, he punched them or kicked them, creating some much needed distance, he then pierced their necks with his spear.

“Wow. Look at that guy.”

“Isn’t he a greenhorn from the 13th?”

“What kind of spearmanship is like that for a newcomer bastard?”

The soldiers who slashed down their orcs counterparts, and were now taking some much needed breathers – looked at Roan while muttering. Spearmanship that’s consists of concise movements, and flows from one point to another without end. It was hard to expect that it was spearmanship from a new enlisted soldier, who barely just finished his recruitment training.

“Isn’t he better than our Lieutenant?”

“Last time, I saw the skills from Captain of 5th squad, and I think that it resembles something just like his.”

“Wow! Did you see it? He hit the chin of a monster who was charging in with the butt of his spear, and afterwards while spinning, he then smashes it’s head!”

“I saw it. I saw it. Those skills aren’t something that a mere greenhorn should be able to do.”

The soldiers talked.

And that was the same for the soldiers from the 13th squad.

A proud expression appears on their faces.

‘A lucky bastard entered our 13th squad.’

‘Kukuku. Look at how dumbfounded those guys from the other squads are.’

‘The guy who shows himself the most in this battlefield is Roan.’

But of course, there was also Pierce who was confronting the orcs with quite a good show of skills, but that guy gave the impression of someone training rather than doing battle.

An excessively clean feeling.

‘If you don’t kill them like Roan, it means that you don’t have much motivation.’

Captain Tane smacked his lips as if it were a regretful sentiment.

But actually, that was because these kinds of orcs were really easy opponents for Pierce, but there was no one who knew about this fact.

No, there was just one person who knew it: Roan.

‘He seems to have come on an excursion.’

Roan looked at Pierce who was massacring the orcs in a relaxed manner, and mumbled.

‘These kinds of orcs should be really easy opponents for you.’

He breathed in a breath after easily disposing of two goblins who were charging at him.

‘But where is Glenn?’

Roan frowned.

Because he couldn’t see Glenn among the 13th squad members.

Roan, who was searching for Glenn within that battlefield, frowned.

That guy seemed to have been swept away to the front lines, when the cavalrymen and the infantry charged through.

‘Damn! Not there!’

Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the ground sprinting.

Tane, who looked at Roan leaving the ranks, shouted to him.

“Roan! Where are you going!”

Roan replied without even looking back.

“I’m going to rescue Glenn!”

Chapter 19




The reason why Roan prowled within the center to rear fighting areas against these goblins and the orcs.

Even though he’d set a strenuous plan of accumulating merits, the main reason he didn’t venture towards the front lines.

‘It’s because over there are those bastards.’

An existence triple the size of a human, which also has the strength to smash a boulder in pieces with only a single punch.

‘Ogre.’

Roan’s face stiffened at the thought; remembering what occured in the past.

Although he didn’t remember the exact numbers, there certainly were ogres with the horde attacking from the east and west of Pedian’s plains.

The ogres slowly appeared from the flanks, while the orcs and goblins garnered most of the attention of the humans within the frontlines.

The ogres crushed the soldiers with overwhelming strength.

‘Will I be able to take them on?’

Roan shook his head.

With his current skills, facing an ogre alone was impossible.

And because of that, he was planning to leave them to soldiers of the 7th Special squads, who were constantly in the forefront.

‘But why are you there?’

Roan’s eyes chased Glenn’s whereabouts, who was still carrying on somewhere in the forefront.

‘If that guy dies, Celine will become sad again.’

He didn’t want to see her sad.

Roan’s feet hurriedly sprinted faster.

“Glenn!”

He yelled while charging through towards the front.

Only then did Glenn, who was staring at the front with an absent minded expression, turn to look back.

“Roan!”

Glenn smiled brightly, filled with a sense of relief he felt when recognising someone he knew.

Roan smirked at that stupid and honest appearance, then he laughed it off.

‘Do you even know the situation we are currently in?’

When he was mentally scolding Glenn, who wasn’t aware of his current predicament.

The terrifying roar he didn’t want to ever hear, brushes past his ears.

“Kuoooooooong!”

The feeling of his flesh pricking up riddled with goosebumps.

It was the ogres.

‘Damn.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

He could see it.

The huge green thing suddenly surged beside the orc warriors, who were desperately holding the frontline.

‘At least, there should be roughly fifty of them from the looks of it.’

Then, an ogre punched through the 7th Special squad and continued to ploughed forward.

A situation where Glenn just so happened to be behind them, meaning – he now stood in front of the ogre, alone.

“Glenn!”

Roan shouted and quickly flung his body at Glenn.

“Kuooooooooong!”

A club swings through the wind along with an oppressive backdraft from the swing.

“Ughhh.”

Glenn froze in fright while still holding his spear.

‘Kugh!’

Roan’s outstretched arms were barely able to push Glenn’s waist forward.

Boom.

The both of them tumbled forward to the ground.

Bang.

At that moment, a huge club shatters the place where Glenn previously stood.

Splash.

Rock fragments splinter off.

“Uuuuuuu.”

Glenn wore a terrified paled face.

Roan backhanded his cheek with a lot of strength.

Slap!

A crisp light sound.

“Glenn. Grab ahold of yourself! We are going to die like this!”

Juuuk.

Then, the ogre which hit the empty space raised it’s club.

Roan grabbed Glenn’s collar and forcefully lifted him up.

“Run like you are about to die, and only look forward!”

An reaction like he was throwing him.

Glenn stumbled back staggeringly while staring at Roan.

Roan yelled with all of his strength.

“Run!”

At that sound, Glenn nodded and ran towards the rear.

Then, a heavy noise rang by his ear.

Fuuuush.

‘Kugh!’

Roan instinctively threw himself sideways.

Boom!

The club smashes the place he was at just now.

‘I also have to es……..’

Roan who was about to run towards the rear flinched, and gritted his teeth.

The orcs and goblins were now blocking his path.

‘Damn.’

Gripping his hands with as much strength as possible without further thought.

The orc who appeared out of nowhere with his four canine teeth springing out, mocked with a rough voice.

“Human. Your neck……. Grr.”

Stab.

A spear punches through the neck of an orc.

He didn’t have the leisure to listen at such words from an orc.

Roan forced his path in between the orcs and goblins.

‘If I do this, that ogre won’t be able to attack me as it wishes.’

But unfortunately, that assumption was wrong.

Fling!

The ogre smashed down his club without caring at all, if there were orcs and goblins.

“Damn!”

Roan hit the goblins with the end of his spear while twisting his body.

Boom!

The club smashes five goblins to a pulp into the ground.

‘Crazy bastard.’

Roan gritted his teeth and spins his spear.

Spat!

The spear sharply slices the wrist of the ogre.

“Kuoooong!”

That ogre grabs his wrist along with a wretched cry.

Roan quickly climbed over the huge club which has now separating the orcs, and goblins from him…

Then, a shadow appears over his head.

As he turned to look, a huge fist approached him – hurling down through the air.

“Kugh.”

Roan gritted his teeth, and pitched his body towards the right.

Boom!

The fist smashes the place he’d landed just before.

“Kuooooooong!”

The ogre cried as if becoming enraged at having to hit empty ground, while glaring murderously at Roan.

“Block them!”

“Kill!”

Then, the Special squad appeared beside him holding their weapons.

However, just because of this momentary respite he couldn’t even feel relieved.

‘Annoying things.’

Roan looked at the orcs and goblins already chasing his back, while biting his lower lip.

Spat!

The spear shakes and the tip of it draws a flower in the air.

Stab. Slice. Stab.

At the sudden twirling movements from the blade tip of the spear, along with the unsuspecting chasing orcs and goblins becoming cold corpses falling to the ground.

‘Kugh.’

As he forcefully moved through those spear skills continuously, his palms ached.

However, he couldn’t stop the movements.

Roan turned his body and slashed the wrist of the ogre deeply.

Slice.

“Kuoooooong!”

It let out a wail filled with pain.

Raise.

The ogre was now trying to squash Roan with his huge foot.

Then, the Special squad intervened, attacking it by stabbing into it’s thick skin with blades and spears.

“Kuooooooong!”

It hurriedly tried to step away, giving a long mournful cry while slowly struggling to move.

The ogre couldn’t think straight at the attacks of the courageous soldiers.

‘Now.’

Roan gritted his teeth and after evading the ogre’s foot, he slid below its crotch.

He could see the large and precious thing of the ogre hanging between the loose piece of leather.

‘Die.’

Stab.

Roan’s spear pierces the important part.

“Kuaaaaaaaaaa!”

A slightly different cry until now.

The ogre grabbed his crotch with both of his hands and knelt down.

Boom.

A heavy noise was then heard and a small dust cloud raises.

Roan quickly stepped out from under its crotch, and after swiftly stabbing its side, he raises his spear pointing towards the sky.

Puck.

The spear smoothly stabs into the nape of the ogre’s neck.

“Kuoooooooong!”

The ogre let out a gurgled cry while launching it’s fist.

‘Kugh!’

Roan quickly leapt back while dropping the spear, but then again spun to continue attacking.

In the middle of that, the archers loosed their arrows without stopping.

Shoot shoot shoot shoot!

Arrows stick into it’s hard, thick skin.

“Kuong!”

The waning strength of it’s roars becomes weaker.

Roan gripped his spear with all his strength, and placed the butt of the spear on his chest.

At the same time, he forcefully pushed the spear in with all of his strength.

Kugugugu.

The spear which was stuck in its nape, etches in between hard flesh and skin.

“Kuog.”

The ogre didn’t even have the strength to lift his fist and was becoming slower.

Stab.

In the end, Roan’s spear perfectly pierces through the neck of the ogre.

“Grr.”

A dying sound.

The huge body of the ogre falls.

Boom.

Dust cloud covers the small area along with a heavy sound.

Roan still gripping the spear as slippery blood of the ogre drenches his hands.

Suug.

As he plucked out the spear, the body of the ogre flinches.

Roan observed the surrounding battlefield, the remaining ogres were already being dealt with.

‘I was lucky.’

Roan glanced at the ogre, who lay fallen below his feet and breathed in a deep breath.

If the Special squad hadn’t come charging through, his life could have been in danger.

Then, a voice he was glad to hear yelled out.

“Roan!”

“We have come!”

The soldiers of the 13th squad including Lieutenant Tane and Corporal Lander.

They came charging through the goblins and the orcs with a fierce vigor.

“Kuegh!”

“Kugh!”

The bastards falling without having the chance to resist.

“Roan. Are you okay?”

Pete patted his shoulder and asked.

Roan caught his breath and nodded.

Tane who came a bit late smirked and thumped his chest.

“You were the one about to die while saving Glenn.”

Roan smiled bitterly and asked.

“What happened with Glenn?”

At his words, Tane pointed towards the back of the squad with his chin.

‘Ah………’

Glenn was there.

And Oliver was defending the rear, making sure no one fell behind again.

“By the way…….”

Tane spoke after looking at the fallen ogre.

“Did you also kill an ogre?”

Roan smiled bitterly and shook his head.

“No. I just finished it off when deed was already done.”

At his words, Pete slapped his back.

Puk!

“I saw everything rushing over here! You piercing the ogre’s crotch, and then stabbing your spear in its nape! You were the one to achieve this!”

Then, behind them, an unfamiliar voice spoke up.

“He’s right. It’s correct that this here ogre was killed by this soldier.”

The owner of the voice was from Richard, the one leading the Special 7th squad. He looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“What’s your name?”

“It’s Roan.”

Richard nodded, asking in a burly voice.

“Roan. Don’t you want to move over to our 7th Special squad?”

Chapter 20




It was too much for Roan.

“Lieutenant Richard. Even though you are from the Special squad, isn’t this too much?”

The person stiffly raising his voice was Gale.

“Lieutenant Colonel Gale. Are you really getting angry at me?”

A low voice filled with resolve.

Gale coughed and smacked his lips.

“Ahem. Anyways, we can’t give you Roan.”

At those words, Richard shook his head as if the matter was baffling for him.

“It seems like you don’t realise how outstanding Roan’s spearmanship is. Roan’s level of skills isn’t one to be wasted in a normal squad, especially as a low ranked spearman.”

Expectation fills his eyes.

‘It’s really amazing for such skills to be displayed from an 18 year old novice. If he’s polished well, he may even become as powerful a person as Reil Baker.’

If you were a Lieutenant Colonel who lead a Battalion, it was only human nature to want the best weapons available.

Then, Gale who was hesitating, abruptly yelled.

“Who, who’s a low ranked spearman?”

Richard frowned.

“I’m talking about Roan. I know that he’s just a normal spearman with no assigned positions.”

At his words, Gale grinned while shaking his head.

“Where is that story from? There are merits Roan already accumulated, and because he’s also rendered a great amount of solutions, I was planning on awarding him a position as a Lieutenant.”

In that instant, it was obvious for Richard, but Roan along with the Rose Battalion who were also listening on the sidelines, looked on with surprised expressions.

‘Lieutenant? Already?’

Roan felt his heart thumping excitedly.

It was true that he had accumulated quite a few merits with the Goblin Marauders incident, Slave Merchants and also in this surprise attack, but even so he was still only an 18 year old novice spearman whose just finished his recruitment training.

“Lieu, Lieutenant Colonel!”

The urgent voices of the officers.

Gale looked at them as if ordering them to shut up.

“Are you out of your mind?”

Richard asked back with a composed voice.

Even if he had his merits and his skills were excellent, it was still excessive to appoint an 18 year old novice as a lieutenant.

‘Because leading your underlings isn’t only done with skills.’

The Lieutenant’s lead 20 plus soldiers.

Because of that, one needed leadership to be able to lead the squad members into the battlefield with experience.

So it was difficult to expect that from Roan who had just experienced the battlefield two or three times.

But of course, this was Richard’s belief.

Actually, Roan was an experienced soldier who had roamed the battlefield for 20 years.

‘Even if I do say it, no one will believe me. Anyways…….’

Roan put on a bitter smile and started to remember.

‘The first time I became Lieutenant……….Was it 15 years from now?’

Quite a late promotion.

His friends at that time, were already at least officers or lieutenant colonels.

Or they had retired soon, and returned to their hometown to farm.

Roan was the only one who drifted the battlefields as a normal soldier.

‘But to become a lieutenant so soon…….’

A bewildering feeling, yet overflowing with joy.

Then, Gale’s voice was heard.

“I am not out of my mind. I’m planning to add one more squad with this opportunity.”

“And how are you going to fill the squad members?”

“There are squads who suffered immense losses in this battle.”

At Gale’s reply, Richard frowned.

“Are you saying; that you are willing to gather squad members from other squads to form a new one?”

“Yes! You can see that the newly formed 42nd squad, will comprise as a union squad.”

An unobstructed reply.

Richard looked at Gale’s eyes fixedly.

‘It seems like you don’t want him to be taken.’

In the end, he let out a sigh and shook his head.

“If you are willing to go up to that point, I will fall back.”

Richard looked at Roan.

“If you need some help, come and look for me anytime.”

Roan bowed his head instead of replying.

Richard moved his feet and when he looked at the dispirited officers, he shook his head.

“You too will have it real hard.”

Incomprehensible words.

But the officers slightly lowered their heads, as if they had understood enough.

As Richard walked out, Keniss; who had the fiercest temperament, stood out to try to hold back Gale.

“Lieutenant Colonel. I think that a seat of Lieutenant for an 18 year old novice – is too excessive.”

The other officers also stand up.

“That’s right. Why don’t you give him a seat of Corporal for the 13th squad?”

“Or raising his salary should also be good enough.”

However Gale wasn’t planning on stepping back.

‘I will certainly keep the words I said.’

He looked at the officers with fierce eyes.

“I have no plans on changing my word. Keniss, Jack and Dosen, proceed to the other squads and bring in some squad members. The Lieutenant for the 42nd squad shall be Roan.”

Gale directed his sight towards Roan.

“Roan. You can do it well right?”

At those words, Roan slightly lowered his head.

“I can do it well.”

He didn’t say that he would try his best, or will work hard.

‘Will do it well.’

This situation needed those words right now, and he was also confident.

Gale nodded with a satisfied expression.

Then, Roan raised his head and after glancing at the cold officers, he spoke with a low voice.

“Um but……”

As his words became hesitant, Gale made signs with his eyes as if it was alright to speak.

Roan laughed awkwardly and continued speaking.

“I have some soldiers that I wish to secure for my squad.”

*****

Austin was a 28 year old hot blooded man who has been roaming the battlefield for 8 years.

Although his spearmanship was shapeless, he had really superb strength so he managed to render small merits many times.

‘Good. If I keep this, in one more year I will become promoted to squad commander.’

When he was in his break daydreaming.

“Austin. It’s a transference order.”

The transference orders dispensed throughout Rose Battalion abruptly.

‘Maybe! Already obtaining the promotion for Lieutenant?’

If it wasn’t for that, there was no reason for him to transfer squads.

Expectation made his chest heave up and down.

But the reality which fell was drainwater.

‘To serve this novice as my lieutenant?’

His face kept contorting.

And this wasn’t only Austin’s thoughts.

‘Damn. I stepped on shit.’

‘To serve a novice who just finished his training as a lieutenant.’

‘Aren’t we only going to die because of this novice lieutenant?’

On the faces of the soldiers; anger, annonyment, rage and finally disappointment could be seen.

‘Yea. I understand you.’

Roan looked at the faces of these soldiers and smiled.

Because he would also become annoyed if he was told to serve an 18 year old novice as a lieutenant.

He took in a deep breath and looked at the eyes of the soldiers fixedly.

“You all should have complaints. And you may not be able to understand.”

A childish voice.

The faces of the soldiers contort even more.

Roan didn’t become disturbed and kept talking.

“I won’t talk for long.”

He raised his ten fingers.

“Just ten days. Just believe in me for ten days and follow me. If perhaps, you still don’t like me after ten days, I will make you return to your original squads.”

Only then did the faces of the soldiers loosen up.

‘Ten days……..’

‘So I only have to endure it for ten days, right?’

They would have to act sloppy until then.

Then, behind the dispirited soldiers a loud reply could be heard.

“Understood!”

The owners of those voices were no other than Pierce and Glenn.

They were the soldiers Roan wanted to take in.

Roan turned back and let out a loud laugh.

‘Rest well tonight. Because you won’t be able to think straight starting from tomorrow.’

His corner of the mouth raises with an ill nature.

*****

A group of people enters the camp.

A worn out armor drenched with blood stains.

“Huk. Huk.”

Chests that shake roughly.

However their eyes were fierce and their steps imposing.

The soldiers whom were having their break near them started to whisper.

“It’s the Ghost squad.”

“They say that they also did it this time?”

“That Lieutenant over there is the Ghost of the Battlefield. It is Ghost of the Battlefield.”

“He’s really amazing. Amazing I tell ya!”

“They say Ghost squad annihilated three monster dens in just ten days.”

The soldiers of that group received the gazes of the other soldiers and marched towards a deeper part of the encampment.

Then, a magnanimous voice was heard.

“Oho! Ghost of the Battlefield!”

The man who approaches while shaking his hand was Pete.

The man that was walking in front of the group smiled brightly and bowed down.

“Mister Pete.”

A kind salute.

At that instant, Pete shakes his body and his hands with big motions.

“Aigoo. Lieutenant Roan, please talk to me at ease.”

A humorous voice.

Roan smirked and shook his head.

“Stop making fun of me.”

“Ahem. It’s because it’s funny.”

Pete smiled brightly and scratched his chin.

He looked at the men behind Roan and exclaimed in amazement.

“Lieutenant Roan. You also did one today?”

At those words, Roan looks back.

Fierce eyes and imposing attitudes.

They were the soldiers that just ten days ago wore faces full of annoyance and outrage.

The newly established 42nd squad.

Now, the 42nd squad was being called as the Ghost squad.

“Yes. We encountered some goblins.”

“You encountered them? You didn’t move to find them?”

Roan just smiled brightly instead of replying.

Pete put on a humorous expression.

“Lieutenant Roan, your nickname is Ghost of the Battlefield, Ghost.”

He hit Roan’s shoulder and continued speaking.

“Because you guess where the monsters are, and where the den of the monsters is located. That’s why you are a Ghost.”

At his words, Roan put on a bitter smile.

‘It’s fortunate that I’m not the ‘Divine Teller of the Battlefield.’

Chapter 21




Just because Roan returned to the past, doesn’t mean that he remembered all locations of the monsters.

‘But I do remember all the fierce ones.’

Aside of those, it was all blurry. So in one word, he was fighting while combining all of those blurry memories.

And of course, even with just that, the accuracy was so high that he even gained a title of Ghost of the Battlefield.

But most of all, there was another big benefit.

“Lieutenant. We finished our training.”

The owner of the valiant voice was Austin.

‘Their attitudes have changed.’

The biggest gain.

That was the change of attitude from the soldiers who belong to the 42nd squad. They were onced filled with outrage, annoyance and discomfort.

The members of the squad all recognized Roan’s skills in just ten days.

‘But of course, not all of them are like that.’

A bitter smile appeared in his face.

Austin looked towards Roan and took in a deep breath.

‘His spearmanship is like this, but his comprehension skills of the battlefield and ability to command his soldiers are also outstanding. He just seems like a soldier whose roamed the battlefield for ten years.’

Because of that, he felt stuffed.

‘I do want to return to my original squad…..’

If he returned to his original squad and accumulated a bit more merits, he would be able to attain the Lieutenant seat.

‘But I want to be next to him more than that.’

Roan was only 18.

He was really young.

That meant that he had a lot more potential and could grow more so than now.

‘Perhaps he could become a commander whose name is known throughout the kingdom, no, the continent.’

A great commander ruling the heavens and earth.

‘An ally who rules the earth along with a great commander. It’s not a bad future.’

Austin puts on a smile.

Then, he heard Roan’s voice.

“Today is the tenth day. How many members want to return to their own squads?”

“It’s four.”

“There aren’t as many as I thought. What is Sergeant Austin planning to do?”

A question thrown casually.

Austin looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“I want to serve next to you.”

A bright smile appears in Roan’s face.

“Then, I will be in your care.”

“Me too, I will be in your care.”

Austin bends his head.

On this day, the four people who still thought of Roan as a greenhorn all returned to their respective squads.

“They are all crazy.”

“They are planning to keep serving below that greenhorn?”

“Don’t regret it later.”

“This is why you have to choose people well.”

Mockery and ridicule.

But they couldn’t have known.

That the people who will regret this decision for the rest of their lives would be them instead.

“Now! Let’s do our squad training.”

Roan started to train with the remaining squad members.

The training they haven’t missed out once, for the last ten days since he became lieutenant.

At first, the squad members including Austin all let out discomfort voices, but now they rather expected the time to train.

‘The training methods of 20 years from now.’

Roan trained the 42nd squad with the training methods which were fixed from trials and errors 20 years into the future.

‘For now, charging through with a square shape method is all.’

A really simple shape.

However, the aspect of battle changes from now on.

Various formations, tactics and strategies become important.

Even in a squad composed of twenty people, they needed strategy, tactics and good swift movements.

‘If it’s the training methods of 20 years from now on, I can make a powerful squad.’

Roan bit his lower lip and looked back.

The 16 squad members run across the plains and expand from right to left.

“Bear in mind! Simply holding your spear and charging to the front isn’t battling! We need to move taking into account the current position of our squad, and maneuver to the objective!”

Roan’s voice flows through the wind.

“We have to be aware at all times what situation our allies are in, so we can seize any opportunities which are available and give them help.”

A voice filled with strength.

“You have to be able to decide yourselves on what action is the most appropriate one; taking these informations into account.”

Then, he extended his thumb, index finger and shook his hand.

One of the many signs he taught in these ten days.

The members who were placed in the right flinched and moved to the left.

It was a rather quick movement, but Roan couldn’t become satisfied.

“In training, we don’t only train our physiques. We also have to study signs, movements, formations and tactics even at ordinary times. We have to become so accustomed to the point our bodies move by itself without thinking with our minds.”

“Yes! Understood!”

A strong reply.

Roan slowly nods.

It has only been ten days.

‘It’s impossible to master everything in just ten days.’

That’s why they needed to repeatedly train and study.

Then, Roan hit his right shoulder with his left hand and clenched it to a fist.

Swish.

The squad members who were running fast lowered their speed, and completely stopped.

A vast plain appeared in front of their eyes.

Roan took in a deep breath and scrutinized his squad members.

A smile which appears on his mouth.

“Now that we’ve started it, let’s really become a Ghost squad.”

That in itself was a declaration of its trademark.

The squad members gulp dry saliva and nod.

The bright sun sets throughout the plains.

*****

The 7th Division acquired successive victories.

Even in the middle of all that, the Rose Battalions squad activities soared to the point it outshines all others.

“That’s because of the Ghost of the Battlefield.”

“They say he finds monster dens really easily.”

“It’s not only that. Nowadays, the skills of Ghost squad became remarkable to the point it can clearly be seen with your own eyes.”

“They say that they even train separately at break times.”

“Well, they are a newly formed squad, so they would need to train to coordinate with each other.”

“It’s not only that. According to the rumors, they seem to be doing training that have never been done before.”

The newly formed 42nd squad, the squad who was called Ghost squad, was also quite famous among the soldiers of the 7th Division.

It meant that they accomplished so much attention.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

In the middle of a formation from Rose Battalion, a heavy drum noise is heard.

“We are heading into battle! Towards the west side of Pedian’s plain, goblins have appeared!”

In an instant, soldiers rushed out of their tents.

And in the middle of them, Roan and his 42nd squad was also among them.

Gale and the officers appeared while riding horses.

“The Ramsey Battalion, Ultimate Battalion and the Greyum Battalion are battling with a goblin army!”

A loud voice.

“The number of goblins is estimated around two thousand.”

A number that is not too significant nor too few either.

“From now on, we are heading out to rescue the three Battalions!”

Gale unsheathed his blade and points it towards the west.

“Rose Battalion charge!”

Continued by that, the yells of the officers and squad members reverberates throughout the area.

“Charge!”

Dudududu.

A noise that shakes the earth.

The Special squad along with the cavalry take the forefront, and the Rose Battalion sets out from the camp, quickly marching towards the west side of the plain.

‘Was there a battle like this?’

Roan frowned at the sudden unexpected battle.

He didn’t remember anything recent.

‘Well, I do not remember all of the battles that occured.’

Even so, he couldn’t erase a bad feeling.

Then, metal clashing and yells was heard from a long distance.

“Die!”

“These bastards! We will utterly kill you!”

The situation was such that they didn’t need the extra help.

The Ramsey Battalion, Ultimate Battalion and the Greyum Battalion had already pushed the goblins to a side and almost achieved victory.

“Chwee!”

“Chwee!”

The goblins discarded their weapons and flee.

“Chase them!”

“Don’t lose them!”

“Pursue them!”

The three battalions chase the escaping goblins.

“We are also increasing our pace!”

Gale hits the horse.

“Waaaaaaaa!”

The soldiers of the Rose Battalion yell and speeds up.

The infantry squeezed out all of their strength just to catch up with the cavalrymen; galloping farther away.

A forest located at the end of the plain.

The branches shake because of the westerly wind.

The Rose Battalion charged to the deepest part of the forest in an instant.

They become covered by shadows looming off the dense forest.

A chill runs down his spine.

‘Here is……..?’

Roan frowned.

And that was because he didn’t have good memories regarding this forest.

Then, a yell was heard from the front who were pursuing the goblins.

“Uaaaaaagh!”

“It, it’s an ambush!”

“It’s a trap!”

At that moment, Roan’s eyes widen in surprise.

‘Ma, maybe?!’

The bad memory related to this forest.

That resurfaces up in his mind.

‘But that battle is supposed to happen in a years time?’

Roan’s sight follows the dense forest.

Chapter 22




The battle of int forest.

This battle was one that the four troops that belonged to the 7th corps chased the monsters and fell in an ambush and got a huge defeat.

‘The battle we were about to get annihilated without being able to do a thing.’

The ambush tactic of the monsters was that perfect.

However, Pierce was in one of the four troops.

‘He pierced a hole with outstanding spearmanship.’

Because of that, they could avoid everything but annihilation.

‘Now too, the four troops that belongs to the 7th corps that chased the monsters got ambushed. On top of that…….’

Roan’s eyes looked at the entire forest.

‘In the front and rear there are goblins and orcs, and in the sides ogres appear.’

And then, a familiar cry is heard just like it was waiting for it.

“Kuoooooooo!”

Just like Roan’s expectation, orcs and goblin appear in the front and rear, and in the sides, ogres appear.

‘I’m certain. This is int’s forest battle. Something that should be happening next year is happening now.’

His face freezes.

‘Did the future change?’

Roan’s gaze gets stuck to the orcs, goblins and the ogres that come charging.

And then, his eyes shake.

‘That guy?’

The orc that runs in the front.

A big build with hard arm muscles.

His chest that was covered by a worn out armor had a deep blade scar.

‘That orc is certainly the one that came charging first in the last int’s forest battle. He came charging really excited…..’

His gaze subsides calmly.

‘He falls because of a tree root.’

The orc that was charging in, lost balance and fell.

He got caught by the tree root.

‘It’s the same.’

Just that the time was different, but aside of that everything was the same.

‘But is that a fortunate thing?’

A bitter smile appears in Roan’s mouth.

Meanwhile, the orcs yelled.

“Kill them!”

“Kill!”

They yelled with all their strength and swung their blades.

‘It’s not the time to be thinking of other things.’

Roan bit his lower lip and gripped his spear with strength.

Spat!

The spear cuts through the air and pierces the head of an ork.

Then, the sound of the horn trumpets was heard at the sides.

Puuuuuu!

“We are charging through!”

“We charge through the orcs and get out of the forest!”

The three troops had chosen to charge through.

Their objective was the army of the orcs that were at the sides.

Even so, the orcs seemed easier than the ogres.

Clang! Claclang! Clang!

Along with metal clashing, the three troops collide with the orcs.

And the rose troop that were a bit farther than them were in a situation where they had to make a decision.

“Damn!”

Gale gritted his teeth and looked at the battlefield.

‘Ogres at the sides. And orcs at the front and the rear. On top of that, the number of the orcs is a lot higher.’

On top of that, the three troops already chose to charge through.

‘We are also going to the front.’

A quick decision.

Gale raised his blade and yelled.

“To the front! We are charging through the front!”

Roan’s face, that was facing orcs that were charging to him at that moment froze.

‘Ah! No!’

He remembered the truth he had forgotten momentarily at the unexpected battle.

‘We can’t go to the front or rear.’

In his past life, he analyzed the ambush tactic of the monsters after the battle ended.

‘And the result of that was that the front and rear were sorrow.’

They chose the orcs evading the ogres.

However, behind the orcs, there was a huge number of monsters waiting for them.

An ambush tactic behind an ambush tactic.

‘The way to escape is rather the ogres.’

They were certainly an existence that were fiercer and scarier than the orcs, but behind them, it was certainly empty.

‘I have to prevent us from going to the front!’

Roan cut off the neck of an orc and charged to the front line.

Fortunately, the front was momentarily frozen because of the charging orcs.

“Troop commander!”

Roan called Gale with all of his strength.

“Huh?”

Gale that was preparing to charge to the front with the cavalrymen turned his head at the familiar voice.

‘Roan?’

He discovered Roan that was running hurriedly and pulled the reins.

“What happened?”

Asking with a strict expression.

Roan pointed to the front.

“We can’t go to the front. It’s better to pass through the ogres. That’s the way to escape.”

At the urgent words, Gale frowned.

“Are you saying that we should face the ogres right now?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan replied without hesitating.

Gale got perplexed.

‘The number of the ogres were lower than the orcs, but even so there were more than 200.’

It was impossible to just face them with 800 soldiers.

Then, Kennis raged at him with an indignant face.

“You bastard, it seems like you can’t see properly because of the merits you have accumulated! A greenhorn like you plans to oppose the orders of a troop commander!”

All the other adjutants nodded with displeased expressions.

“On top of that, you are telling us to face the ogres instead of the orcs? You think that it makes sense?“

“You are telling us to die!”

“Look there. The ramsey troop already pierced through the orcs. The path to escape is open!”

The adjutants pointed to the orc army in the front and rebuked him.

‘That’s all a trap.’

Roan looked at Gale’s eyes fixedly.

“After you pass int forest, a hill appears over there. And that’s the most adequate place to do an ambush.”

Gale’s face that freezes.

“Are you saying that the orcs are falling back by lying and luring the three troops?”

“That’s right.”

Roan nodded with a solid expression.

Gale’s sight is directed to the front.

The orcs that were being pushed back were getting scattered.

“Charge through!”

“Charge!”

“We are getting out of the forest!”

The three troops pierced through the hole they created and ran out of the forest.

“Troop commander! We have to catch to them! If we hesitate for even a moment, we will get caught in the forest!”

Keniss yelled with an urgent expression.

Gale turned to look back at Roan again.

An expression that was filled with certain.

‘Because of Roan, I have accumulated a lot of merits until now.’

He found the moving path of the monsters or the dens of them.

And didn’t he get the nickname of the ghost of the battlefield?

‘Should I also believe in Roan’s words this time?’

Then, Dosen that was facing the orcs in the rear came running with his horse.

“Troop commander! Something’s weird!”

He stopped in front of Gale and pointed to the ogres and orcs in the rear.

“Look at those guys. Even when they had succeeded on the ambush they aren’t charging in aggressively. This is just…….”

Roan continued the sentence.

“They want us to go to the front.”

Dosen nods with a serious expression.

Gale glared at the sides and the rear and frowned.

‘Dosen’s words are right.’

The chance of victory has already gone to the monsters.

But even so, they repeated pretending to attack and falling back.

It was a certain thing that they were plotting something.

“Troop commander! We don’t have time!”

“Decide quickly!”

Roan’s and the adjutants voices sound.

Gale took a breath and made a decision.

“To the sides! We are charging through the ogres that are at the sides!”

At that moment, Keniss’s face get contorted.

“Troop commander! There is already a path to escape at the front! So why do we have to face the ogr……..”

“Stop!”

Gale shook his hand and stopped him.

“If we get any more late, all of the troop will get in danger! The ones in the front, turn the heads of the horses. It’s to the sides! Pierce the sides!”

“Kugh.”

Keniss couldn’t talk back anymore and shut his mouth.

A reddened face and a cold sight.

He bit his lower lip and glared at Roan.

‘Whew. I got properly marked.’

Roan evaded Keniss’s sight and after bending towards Gale he returned to the 42nd squad.

Puuuuuuuuu!

The noise of the horn trumpet that means charge hits their ears.

“Pierce through the ogres that are at the sides!”

“We are charging through the sides!”

“Run to the west and east!”

The adjutants transmitted Gale’s order to the soldiers.

“Damn! To face the ogres!”

“Why are we leaving the orcs and go to face the ogres?”

The soldiers let out discomforted noises with a contorted face, but they just moved according to the orders.

Roan made a request to the members of the 42nd squad that were in the front.

“Bear in mind. Our objective isn’t killing the ogres.”

Sharp eyes and an expression filled with resolution.

“Our objective is charging through. We just have to pierce the ogres and get out of the forest.”

At his words, all the members of the 42nd squad nod.

“Then, let’s see each other after we survive.”

“Yes!”

A loud reply.

Puuuuuuu!

Just in time, the horn trumpet sounds.

“Charge!”

Roan points his spear to the front and charges through.

Behind him, the 42nd squad follows.

“Waaaaaa!”

“Pierce!”

“Ogre bastards! Die!”

Along with a yell, the charge of the rose troop started.

The objective was the ogres.

“Kuooooong!”

The ogres let out cries towards the charging rose troop. The unexpected battle, no, the battle that was expectable started like that.

Chapter 23




The battle was fierce.

The ogre army that were at the sides and the orc army that were at the front and the rear repeated pretending to fight and retreat and as the rose troop started to charge to the sides, they started a fierce counterattack.

The place you have to go isn’t here, but the front and rear!

A shape that seems to be telling them that.

“Don’t face them directly!”

“Pierce through them!”

“Gather up!”

The thing the rose troop wanted was to pierce through the ogre army and get out of Int’s forest.

The cavalry try charging with great speed.

Dududududu.

Several muscled horses clash with the ogres.

Kukung. Kung.

Then, the ogres shake and fall on their butts.

The infantry raise their respective weapons and stab or slash while advancing.

And among them, the 42nd squad was also there.

“Whistle!”

Roan spun his thumb in a round way along with a whistle and pointed the front and rear.

‘Make a circuit along the objective and charge out the fastest possible.’

Austin and the squad members analyzed the sign and move quickly.

Consistent movements.

Because of that, they could pass through 5 ogres instantly.

If they kept this, the 42nd squad would be able to get out of Int’s forest alive.

Then, Roan’s face became contorted.

‘It’s blocked.’

The squad that were at the front got their feet tied and couldn’t move, and the escape route got blocked as well.

“Kill them!”

“Kill!”

In that time, the orcs and goblin army that were at the sides came closer to them.

‘Damn.’

Roan bit his lower lip and made hand signs to his back.

“Pierce! To the front!”

“Yes!”

Pierce, that was looking at the surroundings with a nervous expression, ran to him with a loud reply.

‘Originally, you should be able to handle three or four ogres by yourself.’

But of course, he was talking about what was supposed to happen next year.

‘Even if it happened earlier, you shouldn’t have any problems handling with one or two of them. On top of that, if it isn’t killing them……..’

If it was only cutting the leg muscles of the ogres, he wouldn’t have any problem against five of them.

If it was Pierce, he had to at least be able to do that much.

Roan wanted to believe that.

“Pierce. You are going to stand at the front with me. We are charging through while slashing the legs of the ogre.”

“Me, me? No, I?”

Pierce talked impolitely and clenched his fist. (Don’t know how to tl this)

Roan gripped his spear and nodded.

“Yeah. If it’s you, you can do it.”

Flames appear in his eyes.

He looked at Pierce’s eyes fixedly.

“I believe in you.”

At that moment, Pierce felt his heart shaking greatly.

‘He believes in me?’

There wasn’t even a trace of hesitation in Roan’s eyes.

Eyes that didn’t doubt him in the slightest.

‘He believes that I will certainly be able to do it.’

He puts strength in his shoulders.

Roan, that was his training companion and now was his superior.

That Roan was believing in him wholly.

A feeling that one corner of his heart was getting proud.

‘I have to act according to his expectations.’

He puts strength in his grip.

Pierce shut his mouth and nodded.

At that moment, a faint smile appears in Roan’s mouth.

‘Right. You just have to fix that soft heart of yours.’

He took in a deep breath, and after he opened his left hand he tilted it towards the rear and front.

The sign of charging.

Spat!

Roan runs at the front.

Pierce followed him with a face that was a bit strange in colour, and the remaining 42nd squad members also followed his back.

Spat! Puck!

Roan’s and Pierce’s spear slash through the air.

The sharp point and blade of the spear slash through the ogre’s leg.

The skills of the two people was clearly seen by the eyes.

Pierce had a splendid spearmanship polished with outstanding talent and senses.

Compared to him, Roan’s spearmanship didn’t have unnecessary movements and had a fierce vigor.

Spat!

The spear of the both of them slash through the legs of an ogre.

“Kuoooooong!”

Boom.

The ogre that kneels down along with a cry.

The cavalrymen throw ropes to its neck as if they were waiting for it.

Tighten.

As the muscled horses pull the ropes, the big body of the ogre falls to the ground.

Swiiiiiiish!

Pubobobok!

Continued by that, the arrows of the archers get stuck in its body.

It was quite an excellent combination, but Roan was already looking what was going to happen next.

“Pierce! Move to the left! Ghost squad! To the center!”

The order he yells with all of his strength.

Pierce and the squad members move as if they were one body.

Spat!

The spear slashes through the air once again.

“Wow. The guys of the 42nd squad are amazing!”

“If they keep it, they will really become a ghost squad!”

At the actions of the 42nd squad, the members of other squad also say in amazement.

And among the squad, they were looking at Roan and Pierce that were facing at the ogres in the front.

“Don’t you think that squad commander Roan’s skill is becoming better by the day?”

“And what about the skills of that greenhorn spearman?”

“They say that those two are acquaintances from the training camp.”

Voices of amazement.

Then, Roan that was facing the ogres and checking the battlefield yells with all of his strength.

“Ghost squad! To the back! Scatter!”

His left hand that shakes urgently.

Austin and the 42nd squad members quickly fall back and break the formation.

Boom!

At that moment, two huge clubs get stuck to the ground.

The ogres that were at the sides were aiming for the 42nd squad and swirled their clubs.

‘Was he facing the ogres and checking the situation at our side!’

Austin put a surprised expression and looks at Roan.

“Kuoooooong!”

Then, the ogre’s cry hit their ears.

Fiung.

A sharp and heavy noise that tears the air.

A huge club cuts the air and smash the soldiers.

Puuk!

“Grr!”

“Kukh!”

Many soldiers get bounced off after they get hit by the club.

Unfortunately, they didn’t have a squad commander like Roan.

“Don’t get scared and pierce through!”

“Cavalrymen! Take the attention of the ogres!”

Gale and the adjutants stand at the forefront and encourage the soldiers.

In this situation, it clearly showed that the rose troop was certainly a good one.

Even the adjutants that blamed Roan for getting trapped, when the battle started they started to fight alone to at least save one more soldier.

“Get out of their range of attacks!”

“The ones at the front! Don’t stop as you wish! The soldiers at the back will get in danger!”

“Charge! Charge!”

Orders and repeating the orders, the yells get mixed.

“Kuoooooong!”

The cry of the ogres shake the battlefield.

The battle became fierce like that.

******

“Huu. Huu. Huu.”

“Huk. Huk. Huk.”

Rough breaths could be heard.

The soldiers of the rose troop sit astride on the hill and let out rough breaths.

A situation where saying even one word was difficult.

Even so, faint delight could be seen in the faces of the soldiers.

‘We survived!’

‘We survived!’

They shook off the orcs and the goblins after piercing through the ogres.

While they did that, 200 soldiers died, but even more survived.

The surprising thing was that no one died from the 42nd squad.

‘Whew.’

Roan sat on the dirt ground and looked at the squad members that were resting.

They were all drenched in sweat and had many injuries.

And among them, Pierce’s appearance was really bad.

“Pierce.”

“Yes.”

Pierce, that was catching some breath, stood from the place.

Roan smiled dimly and grabbed both of his shoulders.

“You did well. Because of you, the squad members could all survive.”

“Squad commander has also had it hard.’

Pierce smiled faintly and lowered his head.

The eyes of the squad members that were looking at the both of them were filled with amazement and adoration.

‘Amazing.’

‘I can’t believe that they are only 18.’

‘These two people will certainly become commanders whose names will get spread on the continent.’

Roan, that didn’t know that the squad members were thinking of this, hit Pierce’s shoulders and turned his head.

The place his eyes were directed to was the place where Gale and the adjutants were resting.

‘There’s still something left to do.’

In the first place, the reason why he proposed charging through the left and not the front and rear was because there was the road to escape but also because of one more reason.

‘We have to save the three troops that chose to charge through the front.’

The three troops that get out of Int forest meet with a monster army at a hill.

‘And the number of them are roughly 5 thousand.’

The total soldiers of the ramsey troop, absolute troop, and grayum troop were barely 2 thousand.

If he left them like this, they would all get annihilated.

‘Originally, Pierce showed extraordinary skills and made a path to escape………’

But now, Pierce was next to him, and not there.

‘The current number of soldiers of rose troop right now are 600.’

Even if they went to rescue, they wouldn’t be able to do much.

‘But if it’s that method…….’

Roan’s eyes shine.

5 years from now on, a student of Tron academy that was located in the capital of Miller presents one report to the headquarters of the kingdom.

Report of Int forest battle.

In the report, the analysis of the ambush tactic of the monsters, and the incompetent countermeasure of the troops of the 7th corps was written.

At the contents of the report, it was obvious for the commander of the 7th corps and the generals all got displeased and opposed to it fiercely.

WIll a greenhorn that goes to an academy know what war is?

Our side had only 3 thousand while they had 5 thousand. What does he imply we should have done in that situation?

The student that got those reactions because of the report he made, only named one strategy.

The commander and the generals that saw that strategy all shut their mouths.

This guy is a genius.

The evaluation of the commanders that analyzed the strategy.

The king that got to know of this late diffused the report made by the academy student to the armies and the corps that were at the front lines.

And Roan too, could read that report.

‘If it’s the strategy that was written in the reports, we may be able to save the three troops.’

A smile that appears in his face.

He doesn’t worry if the strategy in the report will fail or not.

‘Because this strategy is the first piece of art of that person.’

The academy student that made the Report of Int forest.

He was Ian Phillips, that was called as an extraordinary genius strategist.

Chapter 24




‘This bastard again?’

‘What now?’

The adjutants that were seated roundly turn to look at one place.

“I’m sorry to interrupt you while you are resting.”

Roan bent his head and approached them.

Gale, that was quenching his thirst, smiled faintly and nodded.

“Right. What happened?”

“I have something to tell you.”

At those words, Gale put down his water sac and sat properly.

The adjutants also started to gather.

‘Right. Let’s listen what he has to say now.’

A fierce vigor appears in the eyes of the adjutants.

Roan stood firmly and looked at Gale’s eyes fixedly.

It was stately but not conceited.

“We have to go to rescue the three troops that chose to charge.”

“Mmm.”

‘It seems like he’s certain that the three troops are in danger.’

He slowly turned to look at Roan’s eyes.

Eyes that weren’t shaking at the least.

‘In the first place, he opposed to charging through saying that there would be more monsters over there.’

If that was true, the three troops that chose to charge through were like a rabbit in a tigers cave.

Then, Kennis’s voice was heard.

“Saying that we have to rescue the three troops means that they are in danger, right?”

“That’s right.”

A reply without hesitation.

“How can you be so sure?”

It was a question pressing for an answer, but he wasn’t talking as if he was ignoring him as before.

‘Because there’s something he showed us, I can’t just ignore him.’

When he first said that they had to pierce through the ogre army, he thought that it was a crazy thing.

‘But just like he said, there were no monsters behind them.’

Although they lost 200 and more soldiers, but many more survived.

Not a bad result taking into account that they fell in an almost perfect ambush.

It meant that Roan’s decision wasn’t a bluff at all.

‘Being conceited is one thing, and skills is another thing.’

He didn’t like that a greenhorn ignored orders and ranks and acted by his own.

But his those actions weren’t bluffs but real skills, he couldn’t just ignore him.

He recognized what he had to.

Kennis, that roamed the battlefield for many years as an adjutant of rose troop, was that kind of soldier.

Roan took in a deep breath.

“We shook off the ogres, orcs and goblins that were chasing us. Then, where would those guys go?”

His finger points to the north.

“They are going to catch the three troops. Because that’s the main force.”

“Mmm.”

Kennis and the other adjutants sigh in amazement.

‘It’s true that they didn’t look like chasing us that fiercely.’

‘At one moment, they had fallen back.’

‘It seemed like they were returning to Int forest.’

Then, Gale’s voice was heard.

“Fine. Let’s take into that all you said is true. Even so, our force is only 600. What will these many soldiers do? I think that it would be better to return quickly to our camp and request for help.”

At those words, many adjutants nod.

Roan shook his head with a frozen expression.

“Meanwhile, the three troops will be annihilated.”

“Mmm.”

Gale shuts his mouth.

Then, one of the adjutants that was at the back said sullen words.

“Even so, we can’t die along them.”

Rescuing the three troops in this situation was the same as suicide.

Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.

“I have a method.”

And Ian’s strategy that later on would be called as a genius strategist.

He looked at Gale and asked carefully.

“May I look at the military map.”

“Military map?”

Gale wondered for a moment and made eye signs to Dosen.

Dosen nodded slightly and took out a large paper roll from his chest.

Swuush.

The rolled piece of paper got unfold and the map showed itself.

‘I did expect it, but it’s more of a mess than what I thought.’

Roan let out a small sigh.

It was embarrassing to call map to the thing in front of him.

‘I have to wait 10 more years for the detailed map of the kingdom to come out.’

And of course, that was also one of Ian Philip’s piece of work.

Roan held back his regret and pointed to one side of the map with the tip of his finger.

“This is our current location. And………”

The finger gets a bit higher.

The three troops that chose to charge will be around here. They would probably be receiving the attacks of the monsters.”

His finger gets down again.

“And this river is Prely river. It’s wide but a shallow river.”

Gale and the adjutants that were listening to the explanation all nodded.

Because they also knew well about Prely river.

‘And especially now that it’s spring, it’s so shallow that it only reaches to the tigh of a grown man.’

Roan looked at Gale and the adjutants and continued saying.

“We have to do an inundation tactic.”

At that moment, everyone frowns.

“Inundation?”

At the words that were asking back, there were many doubts.

‘He wants to use an inundation tactic in Prely river right now?’

‘It seems like he isn’t in his right mind.’

Distrusting faces.

But Roan’s face was still confident.

His finger points Prely river and follows to the right.

Point.

The tip of his finger stops.

“This place has the answer.”

*****

Dududududu.

Horse steps that shake the earth.

Roan hit the horse and took in a deep breath.

‘The reason Ian Phillips is amazing isn’t only because he makes wondrous tactics.’

There were many reasons as to why Ian was called as the outstanding genius strategist, but the biggest reason was on the point that he knew the importance of information better than anyone else.

He ran an information organization in Rinse kingdom for the first time.

‘Before that, you gave money to an information guild or thieves guild. That was all.’

Ian took and analyzed even the little bit of informations other wouldn’t hold any regard.

Because of that, he could gather a massive amount of information better than anyone else and with this information, he made the most effective and efficient strategies.

‘It’s also the same for Int’s forest battle.’

Ian focused on the information that nobody that analyzed Int forest’s battle knew, or even if they knew they didn’t hold it in any regard.

‘Temporary reservoir.’

The farmers in Pedian’s plain made a temporary reservoir in Prely’s river for when winter ended.

They were gathering water in case they lacked water at spring, when it started they yearly farming.

Because of that every spring, Prely river was really shallow compared to it’s width.

‘We are exploding that reservoir.’

That was what Ian thought and the tactic Roan was going to do.

Roan hit the horse and looks to the west.

The place where the temporary reservoir was located.

‘By now, the troop members may also have reached.’

The rose troop were currently divided in two.

The main troop Gale led went to the temporary reservoir to explode the bank.

And Kennis and Roan were leading 300 soldiers and were running towards the three troops.

‘It would be bad if our allies also get swept on the inundation tactic.’

Roan calmly gripped the reins.

“Adjutant Kennis.”

“Huh?”

Kennis, that was running at the front, looks back.

Roan points to the earth with his finger.

“We will have to leave some archers here.”

At those words, Kennis nods and does a hand sign.

One of the soldiers left the ranks and protected the place.

Roan left archers at moments while running to the west.

When they were running without stop and were about to pass a hill.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Metal clashing could be heard.

“Kill!”

“Don’t get pushed back!”

“If you do, we die!”

Continued by the yells.

At that moment, Roan’s face contorts.

‘How so?’

A face he couldn’t believe it.

Roan quickly hit the horse’s stomach and lowered his posture.

The horse runs like a feather and stand at the peak.

He saw the battlefield with his eyes.

“How are the three troops here?”

An unexpected situation.

Then, Kennis approached him and asked.

“According to your guess, shouldn’t our allies be at the other side of the river? But……”

The three troops had already passed the river and were pressed to the south.

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘It’s different.’

Originally, the three allied troops should be fighting the monsters at the northern part of the river.

An unexpected battle again.

‘It’s certainly different. But…..’

Roan glared at the battlefield with sharp eyes.

His head spins so fast noises could be heard.

Unexpected battle (4) End

Chapter 25




The place Roan’s sight was directed to was across Prely’s river.

It fell on the monster army that caught the rear of the three troops.

‘It’s the goblin and orc army that were at the rear of Int’s forest.’

On top of that, the ones that chased the rose troop should have regrouped.

His two eyes become thin as thread.

‘That flag is………’

A flag mixed with red and blue.

It was a familiar flag.

‘The flag of Sedek’s troop, a part of the orcs alliance northern parts of Rinse.’

It wasn’t that Roan remembered all the flags of the troops.

However, even if he wanted to forget that flag, he couldn’t.

His hand goes to his left side.

The feeling a scar that doesn’t even exist now hurts.

‘We clashed against Sedek’s troop in the region of Krel.’

And then, a young orc warrior swung his blade and sliced his side.

It wasn’t so deep as to danger his life, but even so, it was quite a big injury.

Because of that, he had to leave the battlefield for a while and focus on healing.

‘Meanwhile, my comrades all kept accumulating merits.’

Perhaps, his life could have started to become a mess since then.

‘So how would I be able to forget that damnable troop flag.’

But of course, he couldn’t know if Sedek’s troop participated on Int’s forest battle in his past life.

‘It’s quite similar to my past life, but some little parts are different.’

The reason why he couldn’t be careless even when he knew the future.

Roan checked the battlefield once again with calm eyes.

Then, he frowned and looked at Kennis.

“Adjutant Keniss.”

“Yeah.”

Kennis, that was also checking on the battlefield, nodded.

Roan pointed at Sedek’s troop, that was at their rear.

“Aren’t they a bit weird?”

“Weird?”

Kennis tilted his head and turned to look to the rear.

After he stared for a long while, he put a surprised expression.

“What are they doing right now? Are they joking?”

A voice that was filled with displeasure.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“They are only pretending to attack our troops.”

He couldn’t know the exact reason.

However, the certain thing was that Sedek’s army that was at their rear, were only pretending to attack while maintaining a distance.

Roan organized his thoughts for a moment and looked back at Kennis.

“I have thought of something good.”

He whispered towards Kennis for a little while.

Kennis frowned after he heard all the story.

“Won’t it be dangerous?”

Roan replied with a calm voice.

“It is, but to secure a path to escape, we can only lure Sedek’s troop.”

“Mmm.”

Kennis gulped and looked at Roan.

‘I thought that he only knew how to use his head, but it seems like he has some courage and determination.’

The strategy Roan said.

‘While we are luring the rear of Sedek’s army, make the three troops retreat by crossing the river.’

If only they could lure Sedek’s troop, they would be able to open a path for the three troops to retreat.

“And are you confident on being able to do it?”

“Yes. I am.”

Roan nodded without even a trace of hesitation.

Kennis looked at his two eyes and then made hand signs to his back.

Karon, that was in charge of the 1st squad approached.

“Karon.”

“Yes. Tell me.”

At Kennis’s call, Karon bent his head.

Kennis pointed towards Sedek’s troop.

“Get 10 squads and attack Sedek’s troops rear.”

“You want me to attack the rear of the monsters army?”

Karon put a surprised expression and looked at the battlefield.

Even at first glance, their numbers were more than 3 thousand.

To attack them with only 200 soldiers, they had an overwhelming number of monsters.

Kennis nodded slowly and looked at Roan.

“Roan will help you.”

A voice that contains strength.

It was a voice that was filled with trust.

Roan slightly bent towards Kennis.

‘I don’t know if this choice will be a right one or a wrong one.’

An unexpected battle.

This choice was all on Roan.

‘But if I can just succeed, I will accomplish a really big merit.’

Fire appears on his eyes.

*****

Sedek got on the war horse and glared at the battlefield.

“Kukuku.”

Laughter kept coming out from between his cuspids.

‘Was he called Pelt?’

The thing Sedek was looking at was at the monster army that were doing a fierce battle that was happening across the river.

And between them, it was an orc warrior swinging his halberd.

‘Hmph. I can’t let a bastard from the Byron kingdom to get all the merits.’

His eyes became sharp.

The orc warrior that was swinging the halberd was a friend of Tarem, that was from the same Byron kingdom, and proposed to make this ambush tactic for revenge.

‘That stupid bastard Tarem said that he was going to make a night raid and after he took some warriors from the orcs alliance of our Rinse kingdom, they were the ones that rather suffered a surprise attack and got annihilated.’

Even so, the supreme commander of the orcs alliance Rak, kept more trust on the orcs from Byron kingdom.

‘Damn. I don’t know why he keeps covering for the defeated bastards.’

His face contorted.

Sedek, that was from Rinse kingdom and even got attention on the northern Rinse orcs alliance, didn’t really like supreme commander Rak’s decision.

‘Even so, I can’t oppose him……. I can only hope for that Pelt bastard to die on this battle. Kukuku.’

He called his adjutants with some hand sign.

“Keep in mind. We are only pretending to attack. We will wait until Pelt’s troop crumbles.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The adjutants nodded and scattered to the sides.

They acted as if they were attacking just like Sedek’s order, and didn’t move first.

‘Kukuku. Even if he survives, if his losses are great you won’t be able to say that it’s an outstanding merit.’

Laughter keeps coming out.

Then, a yell was heard flowing through the west wind.

“Sedek!”

A loud yell

‘Who dares to call my name?’

Sedek frowned and turned to look at the place where his name was called.

Dudududu.

He saw soldiers charging to them while climbing the hill.

“Ambush?!”

Sedek got surprised but in the end, burst out of laughter.

“What is it? That’s all? Kukuku.”

The soldiers charging towards him were barely 200.

His numbers were more than 3 thousand.

“Sedek!”

A loud yell was heard once again.

The owner of the voice was a youth with a childish face that was at the front of the soldiers.

It was Roan.

‘Certainly, his body is really impressive.’

Roan looked at Sedek that was looking at him being on top of the war horse and gasped in amazement.

His body that was covered with strong muscles was as thick as a tree.

‘Even so……..’

The corner of his mouth rises slightly.

He knew his fatal weakness.

“Sedek! You stupid orc!”

Roan’s voice cuts through the battlefield.

Some orcs got agitated and breathed hard.

“Who dares to our troop commander!”

“Your heads should really be screwed!”

However, Sedek himself was calm.

“Kukuku. Is he provoking me? Leave him. There’s no need to pay them any mind. Just fire some arrows.”

And then, Roan yelled loudly once more.

“Sedek! You looking at the battlefield while seating on the horse is really manly!”

A sudden praise.

Sedek frowned and glared at Roan.

‘What is he planning?’

He started to get uneasy.

A faint smile appears on Roan’s face.

“The Sedek troop’s members should be really happy! To have that cool and dignified man as your troop commander!”

A continued compliment.

“What is it?”

“Is that human crazy?”

Even the orcs get perplexed.

And it was also the same for Karon and the squad members.

“Squad commander Roan. What are you doing right now?”

As Karon asked, Roan replied with a nervous expression.

“Now, that bastard will charge towards us as crazy. And then, we will have to cross Prely river and flee.”

“He’s going to come to us after you compliment him like this?”

Roan nodded and looked at Sedek.

He yelled with all the strength he had.

“But do you know that? That your troop commander doesn’t have a dick!”

In an instant, the orcs all look towards Sedek.

‘Troop commander Sedek, that’s a warrior among warriors, is an eunuch?’

‘No, no. It’s not to the point of being an eunuch, but he directly doesn’t have one?’

Sights filled with doubts.

Sedek’s face becomes nicely contorted.

Roan kept yelling.

“That bastard was having fun with some bitches and in the end, it got cut by his wife! His crotch is really clean!”

Roan’s words were all true.

These were all things that got revealed when Sedek’s troop got defeated in Huil’s battle, and they got interrogated.

‘That bastard Sedek kept this truth really well hidden. Because it’s the most disgraceful thing for an orc warrior.’

Mumbles of the orcs become harsher.

“If you can’t believe me, send one adjutant and make them put his hand on his crotch! It will slip away! Hahaha!”

Roan drenches his throat and laughs hysterically.

Karon, that was well aware of his surroundings, laughs together and makes some handsigns.

And then, all of the squad members burst out of laughter.

“HAHAHAHA! They say that orcs are prestigious warrior, but the one that his lower parts is lose to be the leader!”

“It would be nice to ride the horse! HAHAHAHA!”

“It will be good, because it’s fresh on summer! HAHAHAHA!”

Laughter shakes the battlefield.

“This……This……This……”

Sedek’s body trembled and ground his teeth.

Rage surged up.

“This son of a bitches…….”

In the end, he couldn’t hold it and hit his war horse.

Hiiiing!

The war horse crise and charges through.

Dudududu.

Sedek left back the orcs and ran towards Roan.

“Huh?! Tro, troop commander!”

“Chase the troop commander!”

“Follow his back!”

The orc adjutants get surprised and hurriedly kicked their horses.

At the sudden order, the orcs got started to follow him ack.

“They are really charging like crazy.”

Karon looked at Sedek while panicking and pulled the reins.

The head of the horse turns south east.

“We are running to the south east and cross Prely’s river! Run with all your strength!”

Karon kicked his horse and lowered the posture.

The war horse let a long cry and started to charge while cutting through the air.

Roan and the squad members followed his back.

‘They are following really well.’

Roan glanced back and put a faint smile.

At least half of the 3 thousand orcs were chasing them.

Dududududu.

They could see Prely’s river.

Karon made hand signs to his back and then one soldier grabbed his bow.

Tense.

As he left go of the tensed bowstring, one arrow flies to the skies.

Piiiiiiiik!

A sharp sound hits their ears.

Signal.

That was the signal to explode the reserve, and also the sign of the battle starting.

Unexpected battle (5) End

Chapter 26




Dudududu.

Horse footsteps that shake the earth.

Every Time the horse ran, the rough recoil moved his body.

‘Mmm.’

Kennis kicked the horse and looked at the end of the east.

He felt a rough and disturbing movement across Prely river.

‘It seems like Roan succeeded in luring Sedek.’

Then, the signal should rise to the skies soon.

‘I have to hurry.’

He sticks his chest to the horse.

Dudududu.

The noise of the horse footsteps was heard more clearly.

Kennis and the 100 soldiers went around Pelt’s troop and ran towards the west.

After running around the battlefield for a while, they changed directions towards the three troops.

‘I have to charge in on a whim.’

He saw the orcs and goblins that belonged to Pelt’s troop in front of him.

Fortunately, they seemed like they were really hectic confronting the three troops.

“Charge!”

At Kennis’s order, the soldiers all hit their horses and lowered the posture.

Dudududu.

The war horses clash against the orcs and goblins with a frightening speed.

Pubububuk!

“Kugh!”

“Chwee!”

The bastards got bounced off to the sides along a cry.

“Don’t stop!”

Kennis’s yell.

At the same time, the spear of the soldiers dance while cutting through the air.

Slash.

The heads of the orcs and goblins fall to the ground.

Making a turnaround on purpose and attacking their side on the west was really effective.

Kennis and the 100 soldiers charged through more easily than they had thought.

“Troop commander Ramsey!”

Kennis yelled towards the middle aged man that was swinging his long spear at the front.

“Huh?”

The middle aged man stabbed down the head of an orc and looked at Kennis.

“Rose troop?”

Quite a surprised expression.

Kennis sticked next to him and said with a hurried expression.

“We have to retreat to beyond Prely’s river.”

“What are you saying after appearing so suddenly? Don’t you know when you see the situation? Sedek’s troop is blocking us on the rear.”

An expression mixed with annoyance.

Kennis shook his head and pointed to the rear.

Ramsey that looked at the rear without thinking much, widened his eyes.

“Wha, what is this? What happened?”

The line set up by Sedek got loose.

Kennis gripped the reins with strength.

“Soon, a big amount of water will pour.”

The calm voice passes through the noise of the battlefield and gets stuck on Ramsey’s ear.

The longer the story became, the more surprised Ramsey’s face became.

“Retreat! We are crossing Prely’s river!”

And then, Ramsey’s voice rings throughout the battlefield.

At the same time, the three troops turn away.

They didn’t keep pointing the spear to the west, but to the south.

A path to escape appeared there.

******

‘It seems like adjutant Kennis also did well.’

A smile appears on Roan’s face.

Because he felt how the shape of the battlefield was breaking.

‘Anyways, he’s really charging like crazy.’

His sight goes to his back.

He saw Sedek charging towards him like crazy with a contorted face.

‘If you come to me without thinking much, then thanks.’

He sticked his chest to the horse and looked to the front.

The archers that were stationed at places before coming to the battlefield start to fire their signal arrows.

‘By now, the news should also have been sent to troop commander Gale.’

This meant that they would soon explode the reserve.

Roan yelled towards Karon that was running in front of him.

“Sir adjutant Karon!”

Even if he didn’t do that, Karon that was in his moment of envy, nodded slightly and pulled the reins.

Hiiiiiiing.

The head of the horse turns to southeast.

Karon and the soldiers start to charge towards Prely river again.

‘We have to cross before the water comes.’

Roan bit his lower lip and kicked the horse.

Splash. Splash.

Karon and the soldiers at the front jumped into the river.

Pabababat.

Along the rough movements of the war horse, water splashes to the sides.

“Stop there!”

Behind them, Sedek’s shout was heard.

He had already lost his reasoning by now.

“Troop commander! Troop commander Sedek!”

“Don’t go too in front!”

The orc adjutants and warriors that were following behind him, sweat of anxiety and follow his back.

Dudududu.

And then, the calm river started to tremble.

‘It’s coming!’

Roan’s expression freezes.

Karon and the other soldiers also seemed to have felt the tremor and yelled with a hurried expression.

“Damn! Hurry!”

“Hurry and cross the river!”

The speed of kicking the horse gets faster.

Hihihihing!

The war horse cries longly and rises its four legs highly.

Splash. Splash.

Karon, that was at the front, and the soldiers reached the other side of the river.

When Roan was the last that remained on the water.

Boooooom!

A great amount of water came across the hill with a loud noise.

“Kugh!”

Roan grabbed the reins and kicked the horse.

Hihihing!

The warhorse lets a cry and jumps out of the water.

Pat!

Water drops splash along the body.

A dramatic and elegant look.

Step.

The soldiers and Roan, as the last, all crossed Prely’s river.

“Huk. Huk.”

Roan breathed roughly and looked back.

“Uaaaaa! It, it’s water!”

“Run! Run!”

“Cross the river!”

“Go back! Return!”

The orcs and the goblins looked at the water body that was going to clash against them roughly and got perplexed.

They, that were at the middle of the river, didn’t know if they had to return or cross the river, and they repeated stumbling onto each other.

Even in the middle of that, there was one bastard that was crossing the river with a fierce energy.

‘Sedek.’

Because he ran alone at the front leaving the orcs and goblins, he was almost out of the water.

“You son of a bitch! Receive my blade!”

An evil cry.

Sedek got out of the water along with his horse.

Spat!

The guys blade cuts the air.

“Hmph!”

Roan pulled the reins and fell back.

And at the same time, he twisted the wrist he was grabbing the spear.

Spat!

The spear spun roundly and the blade of it danced.

Cheng!

Metal clashing was heard and sparks appear

“Dam! The orcs are coming up!”

“Block them so they can’t do it!”

Karon raised his spear highly as he saw the orcs running after Sedek like crazy and shouted.

“Block!”

“Kill!”

At the same time, the soldiers attacked the orcs.

“Where are you going! Push them back!”

“We have to get out of the water!”

The orcs were also desperate.

That was because the water was near them.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Metal clashing continued fiercely.

And then, the water came up.

Booboobooboom!

“Uaaak!”

“Kuugh!”

“Kgh!”

The noises the orcs and goblins make.

The huge amount of water swept the bastards like an angered wave.

Psssss.

The water splashed and the cold wind passed through their skin.

They felt the chill with all their body.

‘If, if we were even a little bit late it was going to be dangerous.’

‘It’s an impressive power.’

Karon and the soldiers gulped dry saliva.

The orcs and goblins that were filling Prely river got wiped off cleanly.

If they were even a little bit late, they would also have ended up that way.

“Thi, this son of a bitches!”

“Nasty humans!”

The remaining minority of the orcs and goblins let out cries and charge fiercely.

However, the one that charged in more fiercely than anyone was Sedek.

“Human! I will cut off your neck and chew you off!”

A ferocious spirit.

The fierce threat is reflected on his eyes.

However Roan’s face was still relaxed.

‘He’s really messed up.’

It was really important to not lose your cool on the battlefield.

‘One of the things I learnt during the past 20 years.’

A faint smile appears on his mouth.

Spat.

Sedek’s blade passed right in front of his nose.

‘It’s big.’

It was a certainly powerful attack, but his movements were overly big.

Even now, as one attack missed his shoulder and sides showed.

Paat!

His spear cuts through the air and stabs his waist.

An attack that was like a flash.

“Bastard!”

Sedek cried out and twisted his body.

Spat!

The blade of the spear cuts his side thinly and passes through.

Normally, a situation that would make you shake.

However, Sedek that had already lost his reasoning didn’t care more about water and fire.

He lifted up his blade over his head while not even caring about his injury.

Swuung.

The blade that cuts through the air with a roaring sound.

Sedek swung down his blade with all of his strength as if he wanted to crush Roan.

‘I can’t block it.’

To block it, the strength under the blade was really strong.

Roan pressed the shoulder of the horse with his tigh and moved to the right.

At the same time he twisted his body and let the blade pass through.

“Kugh.”

At that moment, Sedek stumbled to the front.

Roan didn’t miss that chance.

Spat! Pabababat!

The spear cuts through the air and dances.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Sedek ground his teeth late and swung his blade.

However it was impossible to block all of the attacks while he had lost balance.

Spat! Pabat!

Some parts of the body start to get covered by wounds.

‘He is amazing.’

Roan gasped of amazement at Sedek that attacked and defended even while he had lost balance.

‘Let’s see if you can also block this one.’

He put strength on his hand that was gripping the spear.

‘Fifth stance of Pierce’s spearmanship.’

He had almost never missed individual training after he came back to the past.

And because of that, he could raise his skills to where he could execute the fifth stance, when before he could only do the third.

‘I will cut his neck instantly.’

The best skill he could execute without any mana.

The muscles of his both arms get swelled up.

Spat!

The spear cuts the wind.

The body of the spear shakes and twists greatly.

Tuung!

The spear hit the space along a heavy sound.

“Where are you!”

Sedek pulled his blade and blocked the spear

Cheng!

The sound of metal clashing hit their ears.

“Kugh.”

Sedek ground his teeth.

The feeling that all of his palm was getting numb.

‘How is he this stron………’

The moment he was admiring him.

The spear that was blocked by the blade surged above his head.

“Huh?”

Really strange movements.

Sedek just blinked at the unexpected spear movements.

Spat!

And then, the spear that was above his head fell down with a sharp noise.

“Huh? Huh!”

Sedek pulled his blade with a surprised expression, but it was already late.

The sharp spear stamps his head.

Stamp.

Sedek’s head got separated to the sides along a horrible noise.

The eyes that were separated at both sides had a trace of disbelief.

Roan then twisted his wrist and cut off the head.

Drop.

The atrocious head rolls down the floor.

Stab.

Roan stabbed down Sedek’s head.

The spear that surges high to the sky.

At the same time, Roan’s voice rang on the battlefield.

“Squad commander Roan from the 42nd squad of of Rose troop has slain the enemy Sedek!”

That was a kind of ending.

And it was also a declaration of the battle ending.

Unexpected battle (6) End

Chapter 27




Roan raised his spear highly and looked at the battlefield.

“Tro, troop commander!”

“Troop commander Sedek!”

The orcs and goblins that were facing Karon and the soldiers were half astounded at the death of Sedek.

“Now! Attack! Kill!”

Karon didn’t miss the opportunity.

The 200 soldiers pushed the orcs and goblins to one side fiercely.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng! Slash. Stab.

Metal clashing and explosive sounds hit the ears.

Roan looked at the downstream of Prely river.

‘It seems like the three troops crossed the river safely.’

The three troops had already crossed through it without being late.

They didn’t follow Sedek’s back and were pushing back the goblins and orcs that were protecting the place.

Fluuush.

The rough stream of the water was heard.

‘Even so, quite many survived.’

Even after having been swept by the rough water, there was a number of monsters that wasn’t that small lining up on a battle formation.

“Damn! Despicable humans!”

“Chwee! Chwee!”

“Kuooong!”

They couldn’t even cross the river because of the rough stream and just let out cries.

Meanwhile, the three troops took care of the remaining monsters.

“Squad commander Roan. It’s a huge victory. A huge one.”

Karon approached and laughed hysterically.

Roan tied Sedek’s head on the saddle and nodded.

“It’s great that it turned out as it was planned.”

A not excessive humility.

Karon grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“Squad commander Roan. If it wasn’t for you, the three troops were going to be annihilated. This merit is so big that it can’t even be compared to the slave merchants.”

The voice gets bigger slowly.

Roan smiled instead of replying and looked at the three troops that were approaching.

‘I do know that it is a big merit. That’s why i’m happy but worried at the same time.’

The words he gulps down inwardly.

It was certain that he was going to climb to the highest seat on the merits awards.

And it was obvious that jealousy and envy was going to follow back on that process.

‘If it’s something like that, I have gone through that plenty of times for the past 20 years.’

Because of the stupid choices he made on the past life, even after having rendered some merits there were many cases where he got punished.

‘This time, it won’t turn out that way.’

Roan gripped the spear and shut his mouth tightly.

A firm determination shone on his eyes.

*****

“Huh? It’s the ghost of the battlefield.”

“This time, he was truly excellent.”

“Because of the ghost of the battlefield the three troops could avoid annihilation.”

“It’s not only that. He crushed the monster army that amounted to ten thousand with the inundation tactic.”

“And recently, the activity of the ghost squad is no joke.”

“They really fight like some ghost.”

Voices filled with dread and admiration.

The soldiers of the rose troop applauded towards Roan and the 42nd squad that passed in front of them.

Clap! Clap! Clap!

“Because of you, we could save our lives!”

“One friend that’s on the ramsey troop told me to send you his gratitude!”

“Squad commander Roan! Thank you!”

Roan slightly bent and didn’t show that big of a reaction.

But rather, the shoulders of Austin and the other members of the 42nd squad rose.

‘Kugh! I certainly did well on staying on the 42nd squad.’

‘Those guys that returned back then should be regretting it, right?’

‘Hua. It really feels good!’

A smile kept coming out.

Actually, he was betraying his emotions, but one corner of the heart of Roan felt proud.

‘This life is quite fine.’

He was a little bit perplexed when the battle didn’t happen as what he remembered.

But the decision he made with his 20 years of experience was followed with good results.

‘Even if a future different to my memories happen, there’s no need to be scared. Because even if that happens, it isn’t as if the 20 years of experiences will disappear.’

A faint smile appears on his mouth.

And then, a familiar voice was heard.

“Oh! Roan!”

The person that was extending both of his arms and smiling brightly was Gale.

Roan moved slowly and made a salute.

“I came through your calling.”

Behind him, the members of the 42nd squad lined up firmly.

Gale walked towards him and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“Roan. You rendered a really big merit. And because of you, it’s obvious for us, but the other three troops could also escape annihilation.”

“I just did what I had to.”

“Hahahaha! You are even humble!”

Gale laughed hysterically and looked towards Keniss.

“Kennis. Report the big merits Roan has rendered.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Kennis, that was one of the adjutants lined up next to Gale, made one step to the front and unrolled a big piece of paper.

And he slowly started to read down the things he did like investigating Ale gorge, capturing the slave merchants, and the things that happened on Pedian’s plain.

“Lastly, he has slain the neck of Sedek in the inundation tactic. That’s all.”

“Oho. Now that you group it all, it really is amazing.”

Gale gasped of amazement.

He returned to his original place and looked at Roan with a gratified expression.

“Now that the merits are this outstanding, I will have to give you a reward according to it. But before that……..”

Eyes filled with curiosity.

“They say that the tactic you used to lure Sedek was astonishing…..Roan, how did you know that truth?”

Roan slowly lifted his head and looked at Gale’s two eyes.

‘The question I expected.’

He couldn’t actually say that it was something that was discovered a few years later on the process of inquiring Sedek.

Roan already had an answer he had thought of.

“I’m from a little town on Grain’s mountain range. Because of that, I could hear the rumours about the monster commanders without stop.”

“Aha!”

Gale hit his knees after letting out a low sigh of amazement.

“So you also heard that Sedek doesn’t have a dick at your hometown?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

Gale nodded as if the question he had had been answered and clapped.

Clap.

“Good. Then, should we genuinely start the conference?”

He made eye signs to Kennis.

Kennis slightly nodded and ordered some soldiers to bring small leather bags.

“First, I will be giving rewards to the members of the 42nd squad that rendered a distinguished merit.”

At those words, Austin and the others glanced at each other with surprised expressions.

‘We? It’s us?’

Expressions as if they are asking themselves that.

Kennis coughed as no one moved even after he had finished speaking.

“Ahem. Vice squad commander Austin, come and get your reward first.”

“Ah?! Yes.”

Only then did Austin take back that absent minded face and move his step to stand in front of gale.

“You have done well.”

Gale lent one bag and hit his shoulder.

“Thank you.”

Austin bent down and received the pocket with his two hands.

‘For not only the squad commander, but for also us to receive prizes.’

A really unexpected award.

‘This is all because of squad commander Roan.’

Thankfulness and admiration rushed down their hearts.

After that, the soldiers including Pierce and Glenn all received their own rewards.

Thankfulness and admiration also show on their faces.

“Now! Is it now the turn of Roan?”

At those words, the faces of some adjutants stiffen.

Keniss looked at them and luahged bitterly.

It’s because he knew the reason they were putting that face.

“Roan. First, I will also give you a reward.”

“Thank you.”

Roan received the bag and bent down.

It was a little bigger than the ones the squad members received.

However, the rewards didn’t end with that.

“And I will rearrange the 42nd squad to the 12th one and appoint Roan as a class 5 adjutant.”

At that instant, it was obvious for the 42nd squad, but even Roan put on a surprised expression.

‘Class 5 adjutant?’

Roan turned to look at Gale and Kennis as if he wondered if he had heard wrong.

Kennis smiled gratified and slightly nodded.

‘I’m an adjutant?’

He was only an 18 year old greenhorn spearman.

He did render some great merits, but he hadn’t thought that he would be able to climb to the seat of adjutant this quickly.

Taking into account that Kennis was a grade 2 adjutant, it was a really outstanding promotion.

“Roan’s rank will be a class 5 adjutant, and will work below adjutant Jack that leads the current spearmen squad.”

Kennis’s voice was kind.

Gale looked at Roan’s absent minded expression and asked as if he was whispering.

“How is it? Do you think that this much will be enough to what you have done until now?”

Only then did Roan take a hold of himself and nodded.

“It’s a prize more than I deserve.”

At those words, Gale shook his head.

“There are still some points lacking for me.”

That was the truth.

Roan was about to reply something but he ended up lowering his head.

Because the sights of the adjutants next to Gale was really fierce.

‘The reason why the expressions of the adjutants isn’t good is because of that.’

Especially Jack’s face, that had to split the spearmen with him, was a mess.

Then, Gale’s voice was heard again.

“How is it that you aren’t saying anything? I’m not saying this for being pretentious.”

Roan raised his head and looked at Gale.

“If you have something to ask me, tell me. Because if it’s something beyond my reach, I will grant it to you.”

An unexpected opportunity.

‘If it was before, I would have just say no and fell back.’

But now, he wasn’t like that.

And after looking at Jack’s sharp eyes, he became more that way.

Roan slightly bent down and replied.

“Then, give me one duel right.”

“Ah! A duel right!”

Gale smiled brightly and hit his knees.

This dueling right was a piece of paper that could challenge someone without caring about ranks.

But the limits were also clear.

You could only use the duel right given by troop commander Gale inside the rose troop.

And of course, excluding Gale.

“Hahaha! Are you planning to battle with Kennis?”

You wouldn’t get a promotion or some rewards if you won the battle.

Only, the victor will get the recognition of the squad members and at the same time, a rather big reputation.

Roan saved his words.

Gale nodded with a really funny expression and shook his hands.

Then, one soldier brought a yellow and stiff piece of paper, the size of a palm.

Write.

Below the short phrase, a signature is written.

“Here, it’s the duel right. Use it wisely.”

“Thank you.”

Roan received the duel right and after putting it in his chest, he bent down again.

Gale clapped his hands with a proud expression.

Clap.

“With this, the prizes I will give will come to an end. But……”

He paused for a moment and continued to say.

“It seems like the commander of the 7th corps Aaron Tate will also be doing a merits award.”

At those words, Roan looked at Gale’s two eyes fixedly.

A little surprised expression.

Gale smiled and nodded.

“Right. It seems like the commander will directly bestow you the rewards.”

Again, an unexpected thing.

Kennis continued to say.

“The merits reward by the commander will be done after you go back to your respective head quarters, so keep it in mind.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan replied with the calmest expression possible.

However, he was so happy inwardly he wanted to jump.

‘If it’s the headquarters of the 7th corps, it will be Ipen castle. on that place…….’

His eyes shine with a colour.

He thinks up of the shape of the castle in his memories.

The military city Ipen located at the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom.

‘There’s Brant’s library on Ipen’s castle.’

Roan unconsciously rolled his fingers.

One memory roams in his head.

The case that will make the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom noisy.

‘I have to get in there. But the problem is that only nobles can get inside.’

But it didn’t mean that he didn’t have any methods.

He still had the merits awards of the commander.

‘I have to get a permission to get inside Brant library at the merits award.’

A faint smile appears on Roan’s mouth.

His fingers become itchy.

Chapter 28




Roan moved his feet with a perplexed expression.

“Congratulations!”

“Squad commander Roan, no, sir adjutant. Real congratulations!”

Congratulations pour out at the sides.

“Adjutant Roan. Congratulations.”

“Real congratulations.”

A familiar voice.

As he turned back to look, he saw the 13th squad commander Tane and vice squad commander Lander.

“Squad commander. Why are you acting like that?”

Roan laughed awkwardly and shook his hands, but Tane shook his head.

“When you were a squad commander, I tried to pass the matter because you were younger, but you are now an adjutant. Even if you are younger, a rank is a rank. You have to grab the central focus so we can show our military discipline.”

Lander added.

“Of course. We aren’t a goblin army, so we can’t be comfortable with each other. If you don’t act properly, the guys of the other troops will look down on you.”

“Mmm.”

At those words, Roan got silent.

Actually, those weren’t wrong words.

On top of that.

‘He was the same as being 38 years old.’

There was no need to be caught in the bridle of age.

Roan nodded and looked at the two of them.

“I look forward to work with you. Squad commander Tane. Vice squad commander Lander.”

“It’s us who should be looking forward to it.”

Tane and Lander slightly bent their heads.

Austin, that was looking at the side, nodded with a satisfied expression.

“Now it seems like it is spinning properly.”

Roan opened his eyes roundly as if implying what did that mean.

At those words, Austin said in a low voice as if he was whispering.

“Actually, I didn’t quite like that the guys in the 13th squad talked to you without any formalities.”

“Me too.”

“Me too. Me too.”

Pierce and Glenn butted in.

Roan smirked and nodded.

“From now on, I will take that into account more.

And then, a cold voice was heard as if it was breaking the warm atmosphere.

“The bitches really like gossiping all day.”

As he turned to look away, Jack and three other young adjutants were glancing at them.

‘Is it starting?’

Roan smiled bitterly.

Actually, Roan’s promotion speed was abnormal.

He became squad commander after only one week of having gotten out of the training camp, and again, not even after one month he became an adjutant.

‘In my last life, squad commander was the end.’

But of course, he had many opportunities to climb to become an adjutant of the 7th corps.

However, Roan opted to move to the 6th corps, the 5th corps, and the 4th.

Because the closer he was to the 1st corps, the more chances he would get caught in the eyes of a noble or a commander.

‘But in the end, that became a bad choice.’

Because of that, he couldn’t even become an adjutant, and kept roaming the battlefield as a squad commander of a spearmen squad and lost his life.

‘That me climbed to become an adjutant in only two months.’

A promotion speed that was so fast that even the envy of Jack and the adjutants wasn’t enough.

“Why are you glaring like that?”

Jack twitched his brows and approached.

A feeling that he would grab his neck at any moment.

“Roan.”

Jack, that stopped right in front of his nose, said as if he was growling.

“Tell me yourself. For a greenhorn that just got out of the training camp to become an adjutant. Do you think that makes sense?”

“I wonder.”

Roan shrugged his shoulders.

Quite a relaxed expression and attitude.

Fire appears in Jack’s eyes.

“What is that attitude? Did you forget that even if we are same adjutants, i’m on a higher rank?”

He was a class 4 adjutant.

However, Roan didn’t say anything.

Jack continued saying.

“Listen clearly. This year becomes the 10th one I have roamed the battlefield. I walked a horrible hell road that a greenhorn like you that has only been in the battlefield for two months can’t even imagine.”

Roan smiled bitterly.

‘Look. I walked that road for 20 years. And in the end, even my stomach got pierced.’

He forced to gulp down the words that climbed up to his throat.

Jack pressed Roan’s forehead with the tip of his finger.

“You have a need to show some respect to me.”

Roan looked at Jack’s eyes fixedly.

‘What is it, this bastard. Those eyes…..’

Jack’s eyes contorts.

He sensed pity in Roan’s eyes.

That was just like he was looking at a child doing something childish.

“Thi, this bastard!”

In the end, Jack couldn’t hold it anymore and swung his fist.

The fist that comes at a close distance.

However, Roan’s expression was still calm.

‘I expected this much.’

No, even if he didn’t expect it, Jack wasn’t his opponent.

Puk.

Roan blocked Jack’s punch with his left arm.

“This bastard.”

Jack pulled out his arm that got stuck in Roan’s elbow and tried to punch him again.

And then, a shout was heard at his back.

“What are you doing right now!”

The owner of the voice was Keniss.

He approached him and separated Roan and Jack.

‘Spoiled bastards.’

The cold sight looks at Jack and the adjutants behind him.

“Hmph.”

Jack coughed and fell back.

“You are doing really well for someone who has to trust your backs to your allies.”

“I’m sorry.”

Roan bent down first.

Keniss looked at Jack.

“……I’m sorry.”

He couldn’t help it.

Keniss clicked his tongue.

‘Tchtchtch. Jack. it’s too early for you to succeed.’

He wanted to say one more thing, but he sighed in the end and shook his head.

“Whew. Everyone, return to your tents.”

At those words, Jack and the adjutants moved first.

Even while doing that, they didn’t forget to glance at Roan.

“Roan.”

Keniss called at Roan that was starting to move and stopped him.

“Yes.”

Roan replied and came closer.

Keniss let out a sigh and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“The young adjutants will pick a fight with you for quite a while. But you be the one to endure it.”

“Yes. Understood.”

A short reply.

Keniss smiled satisfactorily and nodded.

“If you can’t hold it anymore, use your dueling right.”

At those words, Roan just smiled.

“Anyways, just endure it. I will find some solution.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The conversation ended with that.

Roan looked at Keniss getting farther and took in a deep breath.

‘I can take this much of a fight as much as they want.’

For him, that had the 20 years of experience, this much was at the level of children’s playing.

However, Jack’s expression and attitude was a bit weird.

It didn’t seem like he would back down that easily.

‘In my past life, I was only suffering………’

He didn’t also want to be like that in this life.

And then, the voices of the squad members was heard.

“Sir adjutant. Don’t worry. If adjutant Jack or the others come to bother you, we will block them.”

“We will protect adjutant Roan.”

“Just believe in our 42nd, no, 12th squad.”

Reliable voices.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“Fine. Instead, I will protect you.”

This was the truth.

‘If I become a monarch, you will become generals.’

Roan’s and the squad members eyes burned.

******

“That’s not it. This way, you have to do it this way.”

A voice that felt really stiffled.

The person that was swinging his spear as if he couldn’t understand it at all was Pierce.

He followed Roan’s orders and was teaching spearmanship to the 12th squad.

However, the process wasn’t quite good.

“So, what’s different from what you are doing to what I am?”

“It’s the same poking.”

The voices that were also stifled.

The members of the 12th squad complained towards Pierce.

They couldn’t understand the difference between his spearmanship to them at all.

“This is the same? This?”

Pierce swung his spear again as if he was feeling stuffed.

“Look well. I twist my wrist here like this and shake the spear up and down. But the beat you twist your wrists here is half time slow and you can’t even shake the spear proper…..”

Pierce, that was explaining things earnestly, shut his mouth.

Because the expressions of the members of the 12th squad were that of confused faces.

“Whew. You don’t understand at all, right?”

At those words, everyone nodded.

Pierce let out a sigh as if he couldn’t do it anymore.

“Sir adjutant Roan. I’m surrendering. I can’t teach them anymore.”

Roan, that was maintaining his spear at the opposite side of the squad members, smiled bitterly.

‘Is it really impossible?’

Roan put into effect the individual training along the squad training.

And in this process, he wanted to get help from Pierce.

However the result was a great failure.

‘Well, even in my past life, the ones that could follow Pierce’s instructions amounted to ten.’

And unfortunately, even he couldn’t get in that number.

Roan’s talent was one problem, but Pierce was also the other factor.

‘He isn’t useful at all when it comes to teaching.’

And the problem is that he is a genius among geniuses.

he couldn’t understand why others couldn’t do the things he could.

‘It’s that guy that made the Pierce spearmanship while being seated in an instant.’

Pierce spearmanship, that was picked as the best one among normal soldiers.

And Pierce was embarrassed of that spearmanship.

Spearmanship that seems like child play.

To make him teach something normal was the same as something tough.

‘On top of that, the more he aged, the more peculiar his character became.’

The young Pierce was shy and timid.

However, as he roamed the battlefield, that character changed mysteriously.

‘A thoroughly calculative character.’

He didn’t give and didn’t receive.

He returned what he received.

‘Because of that, when he became a duke, I couldn’t receive that much help.’

And of course, there was a time that he felt disappointed.

But he felt more thankful when he treated him as a friend from the same training camp and a fellow soldier rather than boasting about his rank of duke.

‘Bastard. Would he have cried when I died?’

He got curious.

“Pierce. If perhaps I died, would you……”

The moment he was going to throw the question, he saw Glenn returning.

“Huh?”

His brows twitched.

Glenn was really beat up.

Roan put down the spear and moved towards him.

“Glenn. What happened?”

“Si, sir.”

The voice that was as down as his looks.

Holding his cheek and grabbing his jaw with both of his hands.

Roan extended his hands and took off Glenn’s hands.

In that instant, he saw the eyes and cheeks that became blue.

On top of that, his lips got split up and red blood flowed out.

“Who is it?”

Roan’s voice lowers.

Glenn hesitated and couldn’t reply properly

“Who is it? WHo made you like this?”

As he asked again, Glenn lowered his head completely.

“Adjutant Jack said that I kept wandering in front of him…….”

The end of his sentence subsides.

Roan stroke Glenn’s head.

“Don’t lower your head. You did nothing wrong.”

His face freezes coldly.

Roan moved his feet and moved towards Jack’s tent.

“Where is he going?”

“Is he perhaps going to adjutant Jack?”

“Isn’t it going to become a huge trouble?”

The squad members say extravagantly with a surprised expression.

“Let’s follow.”

“We have to stop him.”

In the end, they followed Roan.

Meanwhile, Roan crossed rose troop’s camp and arrived in front of the 11th squad, where Jack was.

“Huh? That’s Roan over there.”

Jack discovered Roan first and made invidious remarks.

‘It should be because of that guy Glenn, or however he was called, right? Even so, what will he be able to do?’

He sat on a wooden chair on purpose and acted as if he was relaxed.

“Ohh! Adjutant Roan. What are you doing he……”

The words were until there.

Roan, that approached right in front of him, kicked Jack’s face.

Kick!

A heavy sound.

Jack rolled on the floor with the chair.

“Kgh. Thi, this crazy bastard, did he go insan…..”

Curses came out by its own.

But even so, he couldn’t spit them out clearly.

Because Roan was continuing to punch him.

Pubuk! Puk!

Jack’s face became a face along a thick sound.

Pak!

The punch lashes through the nose.

“Kugh.”

Jack grabs his nose with his two hands and pants.

And then, Roan took out a yellow paper from his chest.

Duel right.

He crumpled the dueling right inside Jack’s mouth.

“Uuugh! Ugh!”

Jack tried to spit out the piece of paper but he couldn’t do so.

It was because Roan’s left hand was impeding him from doing so.

A cold and chilly voice was heard.

“Son of a bitch. Who told you to touch my guys?”

Chapter 29




On the faces of the members of the 12th squad, their expressions showed right on their faces.

Perplex, worry, rage, etc.

But most of all, the thing that heated their chest the most was loyalty and comradeship.

‘To get that angry because of a squad member getting beaten up.’

‘It’s a first seeing someone getting that angry.’

‘Because of us, it’s because of us.’

A feeling that they may burst out of tears any time.

And then, the squad members of the 11th squad that were looking at the situation, moved.

“Fuck! Separate them!”

“To resort to violence against someone from a higher rank!”

“His discipline is a mess!”

They seemed to want to hold down Roan immediately.

Then, Austin bit his lower lip and blocked them.

“Fall back!”

Continued by Austin, the remaining squad members aligned at the sides.

“What are you? You aren’t getting away?”

Vice squad commander Walker, of the 11th squad growled.

Austin didn’t get pushed back and talked back.

“You fall back!”

Curses came out.

“This fucking!”

“Fuck, what!”

Austin didn’t lose.

The 11th squad and the 12th glared at each other.

A bloody confrontation.

And meanwhile, Roan’s punches continued.

Puk! Pubuk! Puk!

‘If I want to dispirit him, I have to do it certainly.’

One of the things he learnt the past 20 years.

‘If I step on him sloppily, he will climb up again.’

Before, he was weak in heart, so he always left things half done.

‘Because of that, it wasn’t only once or twice that I got backstabbed.’

He didn’t want to repeat those mistakes again.

Puk! Pubuk!

The punches get stuck in Jack’s face continuously.

“Uuuuuuu.”

It has been long since he already gave up on resisting.

He trembled while surrounding his face with his two arms.

“Fo, fo, forgive me. Fo, forgivemeee.”

It couldn’t be heard clearly because of the dueling right, but he was certainly begging.

Only then did Roan stop hitting him.

“You shouldn’t apologize to me, but to Glenn.”

A cold voice.

Jack stood up slowly with a bloody face.

“Kugh. Kugh.”

It was uncomfortable to breathe because of the completely broken nose.

He took out the dueling right that was stuck on his mouth and stood in front of Glenn.

“I, i’m sorry. I was, was wrong.”

Glenn just nodded slowly at Jack’s miserable face.

An adjutant lowered his head to a normal soldier.

The 11th squad that was looking the situation bit their lower lips.

“Kugh! Sir adjutant Jack!”

“Sir adjutant!”

At the same time, Jack fell as if he collapsed.

The 11th squad members hurried and supported Jack with their arms.

And then, a rigorous yell was heard.

“What noise is this!”

“What’s happening!”

The owner of the voices were Gale and Keniss.

They walked stomping and frowned after looking at Jack that became a bloody mess.

“Just what……”

They couldn’t finish the sentence.

Keniss ordered normal soldiers to move Jack to a tent.

“What happened?”

Meanwhile, Gale asked Roan.

“I will tell you the truth as it is.”

Roan said the truth without even a trace of lie.

“Mmm.”

Kenniss and Gale thought.

‘So Jack was the first to lay a hand.’

‘I thought that he was only a naive one.’

The sight of the two people lay on Roan.

“Whew.”

A deep sigh flowed from Gale’s mouth.

‘He did use a dueling right, but Roan’s action were too severe.’

Jack’s face became crushed completely.

Roan read Gale’s thoughts and lowered his head.

“Troop commander. Although I used a dueling right because of my squad members, I know that my actions were too excessive. I will take responsibility and leave the seat of adjutant.”

At those words, the 12th squad shouted with a surprised expression.

“Si, sir adjutant!”

“Sir adjutant Roan!”

And they kneeled down towards Gale and Keniss and bent down.

“Just take away our reward.”

“Sir adjutant Roan did that simply because of us.”

“We don’t need no reward. Instead, keep the rank of sir adjutant Roan.”

A begging voice and attitude.

From the eyes of Gale and Keniss, that were looking at them, shone amazement.

‘It’s only been one month, but he made the guys from other squads to become one.’

‘To get the trust of the squad members in this short time.’

They got amazed at Roan’s leading abilities.

Gale and Keniss looked at each other.

‘In the end, the fault is Jack’s.’

‘On top of that, Roan used the dueling right.’

Although he exceeded on his actions, it wasn’t that big of a fault to pass a military law.

The two looked at each other and slightly nodded.

“Uhm. Everyone get up.”

Gale made the members of the 12th squad, that were kneeling, stand up.

They shook off the dust in their clothes and smiled.

“Because the meaning of the squad members is really admirable, I won’t pursue this subject anymore.”

“Ah……”

Austin and the other members sigh out of relief.

They ran towards Roan and yelled.

“Sir adjutant! How good!”

“It turned out really well!”

“What a relief!”

Really happy voices.

They were happier than when they received the merits awards.

Roan smiled gratified and hugged them all.

“It’s because of you.”

At those words, Glenn lowered his head.

“Be, because of me, you were about to receive a big punishment. I’m sorry.”

Roan smiled brightly and grabbed Glenn’s shoulders.

“There’s nothing to feel sorry about.”

He looked at the squad members surrounding him and said.

“I told you that I will protect you.”

At those words, Austin broadened his chest as if he couldn’t lose.

“Instead we told you that we will protect you.”

“Right. We did say that!”

“Right. We said that we would protect sir adjutant.”

The squad members said and felt happy.

Roan smiled faintly and hugged them once more.

Gale and Kennis looked at them satisfiedly.

“Roan. He will become a good commander.”

Gale’s words.

Keniss nodded.

“Yes. If he learns well and grows like this, he will become a general.”

At those words, Gale continued saying.

“Right. Perhaps, a great commander that commands the world.”

They felt those things drawing on their eyes.

*****

After the scandal of Jack’s face having become a mess, Roan’s status became firm.

Especially, looking at Jack that finished his treatment trembling whenever he saw Roan, the young adjutants couldn’t think about picking a fight against him.

There were some times the 11th squad picked a fight with the 12th, but after they suffered defeat against Pierce, the situation became one that the 11th squad had to be aware of them.

For many reasons, the topology of Roan and the 12th squad kept rising inside rose troop.

“Starting from now, start organizing your stuff.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Roan replied loudly and got out of the tent.

The smell that was mixed with pieces of metal, blood, horse, and sweat tickled his nose.

Breathe.

Roan took in a deep breath and looked up the sky.

‘After 10 days, is it farewell with Pedian’s plain?’

The tedious monster subjugation tactic finally ended.

After the inundation tactic in Prely river, the 7th corps and Rinse kingsmen kept getting successive victories.

The monsters, that were suffering defeat, started to flee towards the boundaries and Grain’s mountain range.

The people from Rinse kingdom chose not to chase them.

Because having defended Pedian’s plain had achieved their objective.

‘Now, there’s something I have to do before I leave.’

The thing he was postponing because he was hectic.

Roan slowly moved and crossed rose troop’s camp.

The steps continued outside of it.

Step. Step.

Roan, that walked for a long while taking in some air, walked towards the troops camp that was located on the border of a hill.

“Stop!”

The soldiers that were guarding the entrance blocked Roan.

‘What is this? This greenhorn.’

Expressions looking down on him.

“This is thorn troop’s camp. Reveal your name and rank.”

At the words of the big soldier, Roan pointed to his left side of the armor.

There were 5 diagonal sticks sticked on it.

“I’m adjutant Roan and I belong to rose troop of the 7th corps.”

Then, the soldiers that were dispersed, took on firm postures.

Looks of taking in military discipline.

“Sir!”

‘For this greenhorn to be a class 5 adjutant.’

‘If I slipped I would have made a big mistake.’

Just like they haven’t expected it, the perplexment was also that big.

Roan smiled faintly and looked at the soldiers.

“I’m looking for Harrison…….”

Even before he finished his sentence, the big soldier replied.

“If you go inside the camp, there will be the 15th squad. He will probably be there.”

“Thank you.”

Roan nodded and moved.

As he got further away, the nervous soldiers let out a sigh.

“Whew. What a surprise. I have never thought that that greenhorn was an adjutant.”

And then, the soldier that was behind him clapped.

Clap!

“Ah! It seems like he is that person!”

“Who?”

The soldiers tilted their heads.

At those reactions, the soldier that said those things smiled and replied shortly.

“Ghost of the battlefield.”

At that moment, the soldiers let out exclamations.

“Ah! Ghost of the battlefield!”

And then, they turned their heads away and followed Roan’s back.

“I did hear that the ghost of the battlefield was a greenhorn that just finished his training camp……..”

“I thought that he would be well build with big muscles.”

“He’s really a kid.”

Voices filled with surprise.

Although they were from another troop, the ghost of the battlefield Roan was also a famous existence for them.

Especially after the inundation tactic in Prely river, he became all the more amazing.

“I should have shook his hands at least.”

One soldier smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

At those words, the big builded soldier shook his head.

“Tch tch tch.”

Clicking the tongue.

The soldier that smacked his lips wanted to say something because of the embarrassment, but the big builded soldier hit his shoulder.

“You can do it when he comes out.”

“Ah……..”

Exclamations came out from the mouths of the soldiers.

Their sight turns to inside the camp again.

*****

It wasn’t finding the camp for the 15th squad.

Because it was marked outside of it.

Roan carefully got on the camp.

“Who……. Huk! Sir!”

One soldier that was doing individual maintenance looked at Roan’s rank and saluted.

‘The military discipline in thorn troop is really good.’

Rose troop was also an excellent troop, but it wasn’t as hard as this.

Roan lightly nodded and looked inside the camp.

“Ah……..”

A low exclamation.

There was a familiar face in the corner of the camp.

‘Harrison.’

The fellow soldier and friend that died 5 years before Roan.

The guy that died with a big regret, just like himself.

I had to become an archer instead of a spearman.

The words he mumbled everyday rang in his ears.

Roan moved slowly and stood in front of Harrison.

“Harrison.”

A low calling voice.

“Do, do you know me?”

Harrison asked back with a surprised expression.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“I heard the rumors.”

“Rumors?”

Harrison had a confused face.

Roan extended his hand.

“Shall we shake hands?”

“Yes? Yes.”

Harrison hurriedly grabbed his hand.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“It’s a really good hand.”

“Yes?”

Harrison had an expression he couldn’t understand at all.

Roan said in a voice so low it seemed he was whispering.

“It’s a really good hand to shoot an arrow.”

Chapter 30




“Yes?”

Harrison asked back again.

He could only do so.

‘What is he saying so suddenly? No, before that, who are you?’

The one in front of him was of a similar age with him, no matter how he saw him.

If it wasn’t because of the badge of rank that was stuck to the armor, he would have thought that he was a soldier in training.

‘He should be confused.’

Roan had already guessed how Harrison felt.

He lightly shook the hand he was grabbing.

“I’m a 5 class adjutant from rose troop.”

“Sir. I’m spearman Harrison from the 15th squad of thorn troop. But……”

Harrison blurred the last part of the sentence and cautiously looked at Roan.

“You heard rumours about me………?”

Roan nodded.

“Right. They say that there is a really light and clear-eyed soldier among the spearmen of thorn troop.”

“Do, do you mean that’s me?”

Harrison asked back as if he couldn’t believe it at all.

Because even he hadn’t heard those rumours.

Roan took a step back instead of replying and nodded.

“If it’s fine with you, should we go outside?”

“Yes. Yes, i’m fine.”

Harrison followed Roan’s back with a half-absent-minded face.

And then, one rumour passed by his head.

‘It’s Roan of Rose troop, he’s that ghost of the battlefield!’

A feeling that he got startled awake.

‘They said that it was a spearman that just finished his training. The rumours were true.’

His sight fell on Roan’s back, that was walking in front.

‘Then that means that he’s the same age as me…… But to already be an adjutant.’

He felt Roan, that was in front of his eyes, to be incredible.

Roan, that didn’t even know Harrison was thinking like that, crossed the camp and stopped in front of the tent of one squad.

‘Here is?’

Harrison, that was following him, frowned.

‘This is the archers tent.’

He remembered the words he told him.

Those are really good hands to fire an arrow.

‘Maybe? Was he telling the truth?’

When he thought up to there, Roan brought a bow and some arrows.

Harrison hurriedly shook his hands.

“Um, um sir adjutant Roan. I have never fired an arrow until now.”

Urgent voice and expression.

Roan just looked at Harrison acting like this.

‘He was also like this back then.’

Harrison was the same in his past life.

At the order of an adjutant telling him to fire an arrow, he got surprised and shook his hands.

‘But everything changed the moment he grabbed the bow.’

Roan smiled brightly and after hitting Harrison’s shoulder, he moved his feet.

“Ah, it’s, it’s true. I have never fired an arrow……”

Harrison frowned and followed his back.

They walked out of the camp stood in front of a fence.

‘There’s a tree at a suitable place.’

Roan smiled at the tree that was at the other part of the fence.

Give.

The arrows and bow given by Roan.

Harrison laughed awkwardly and shook his head once more.

“Sir adjutant Roan. It seems like there’s something wrong you know about me, but i’m a spearman. A spearman. I have never fired an arrow.”

“I know.”

Roan stubbornly lent him the bow and arrows.

And grabbed Harrison’s hands once more time.

“My eyesight is good. In my eyes, you have more talent in archery rather than spearmanship.”

“Ey. Even if it’s good, how can you at the first time…….”

Harrison couldn’t believe it.

Roan smiled and shrugged his shoulder.

“Harrison. Looking that your eyes are sharp, your chin is small and your neck is long, you are from Owell region, right?”

“How did you…….?”

Harrison grabbed his chin and neck and put a surprised expression.

Roan continued saying.

“Looking at your hardened skin on your palm and the muscles of your arms, you originally trained with the blade. And it’s only been 5 months since you became a spearman.”

“Ho!”

Harrison opened his eyes roundly and gulped down some air.

However, he shook his head and twisted his nose.

‘It seems like he saw my records.’

If that wasn’t the case, he couldn’t guess where he was from and what he trained in with just the sight.

And of course, Roan was reading Harrison’s thoughts.

“And……”

The sharp sight is directed to Harrison’s left hand.

“You have injured your left hand badly. Your pinky doesn’t bend well, right?”

“Huk!”

Harrison got surprised in a big way.

“Tha, how did you know that………..?!”

He hurt his left hand immediately after he entered the training camp.

He received a blade swung by a comrade while training, and the bone in his hand broke.

However he hid it thoroughly from his comrades, squad commander and adjutants, for fear of getting dismissed. And because of that, this truth wasn’t put in any records.

‘It, it’s true. The eyesight of this person is the real thing.’

There was no one that noticed that he had a problem in his left hand.

But Roan noticed it the first time he saw it.

“Because of that, it’s difficult to use the spear, right?”

“Yes? Yes.”

Harrison slowly nodded.

‘This person is a real ghost. A ghost.’

A really admiring expression.

Roan looked at Harrison and put a bitter smile.

‘Actually, you were the one that taught me all of this.’

It was obvious about his background, but also the injury he was hiding.

All of these things were directly told by Harrison.

Roan smiled brightly and hit Harrison’s shoulder.

“How is it? You will be able to believe me, right?”

“Yes. I can believe that…….”

Harrison looked at the bow and arrows and slurred the end of the sentence.

Roan pointed at a far away tree with a confident expression.

“Just three arrows. If you can’t hit that tree after three arrows, I won’t keep bothering you.”

“Three, three arrows?”

Harrison put a surprised expression and asked back.

“I have really never fired an arrow before.”

An earnest face, as if he was asking to believe him.

Roan nodded.

“I know. Just at first sight, it seems like that. But if it’s your talent, you will be able to hit that tree.”

A voice and expression filled with affirmation.

‘Even in the past life was like that. You hit the tree with the third arrow. And a tree that was even farther than the one here.’

But of course, the time and place was different from then.

However, Roan believed.

‘If it’s that talent that made everyone amazed, you would be able to do it plentily.’

He looked at Harrison’s eyes fixedly.

Not shaking eyes.

‘Whew. I can’t do anything about it.’

Harrison couldn’t say anything else and grabbed the bow.

‘Was it grabbed like this?’

He imitated how archers grabbed it.

A really awkward shape.

Harrison charged an arrow and looked at Roan.

“I don’t know if you get disappointed.”

Roan just smiled meaningfully instead of replying.

‘Ey. Whatever.’

Harrison pointed the tree and pulled the bowstring.

Kiigiiikik.

The bow that bend greatly.

“Kugh.”

Harrison gritted his teeth at the bowstring carving at his fingers.

Tung!

One arrow pierces through the air along a heavy sound.

Sueeeee!

A sharp sound.

Roan and Harrison follow it.

Paat!

The arrow missed with a big difference.

‘Well. Right.’

Even so, Harrison that was expecting something a little bit, smacked his lips and looked at Roan.

“You saw right? I have never fir……..”

“There’s still two arrows left.”

Roan lifted two fingers.

“Whew. Understood.”

Harrison let out a deep sigh and charged an arrow again.

‘Damn. Even if I can’t hit it, I would like it if it passes by close.’

Even if he was an adjutant, he didn’t want to show an embarrassing sight to Roan, that was the same age as him.

A conspicuous colour shines in Harrison’s eyes.

‘How did the arrow fly again…..’

He unconsciously started to change the posture of holding the bow and the posture of pulling the string, little by little.

It wasn’t because someone taught him, but he realized it by himself.

A smile appears on Roan’s face.

‘Right. That’s the real appearance of the genius archer Harrison.’

And then, a noise was heard.

Sueeeeee!

The second arrow was fired.

Spat!

The arrow scratched the tree and passed by.

“Huh?!”

Harrison looked at Roan with a surprised expression.

Roan smiled brightly and shrugged his shoulders.

“There’s still one arrow left.”

At those words, Harrison nodded slowly and charged the last arrow.

“Whew.”

He took in a breath and pointed the bow towards the tree.

‘The last one got bent down towards the right.’

Tung.

Sueeeeeee!

A sharp noise.

Gulp.

Harrison gulped dry saliva and followed the back of the arrow.

‘Pl…ease…….’

When the body got twisted on its own.

Puuk!

The arrow got stuck in the body of the tree with a dull sound.

“Nice!”

Harrison unconsciously clenched his fists and yelled.

His chest was beating with strength and his face became bright.

The thrilling shudder flowed on all of his body, which he couldn’t feel when he battled as a spearman.

“How is it? You feel good, right?”

Roan smiled brightly and approached him.

Only then did Harrison release his fist slowly and coughed.

“Hm. Hm.”

His bright face turned red.

Roan grabbed Harrison’s shoulders.

“Harrison.”

A low voice but with strength, and the hot and transparent eyes that don’t have any lies.

“Let’s go together with me.”

Kung.

At that moment, Harrison felt a big rock hitting his head and heart.

The breath that gets clogged.

They had certainly met today.

However, the Roan in front of his eyes showed him a new world.

Actually, Harrison was afraid of going to the battlefield as a spearman.

Because of the injury in his hand, his spear skills fell compared to that of his comrades.

A feeling of becoming a weight to his comrades.

Until now, he had endured that oppressive feeling.

But if it is the feeling when he fired an arrow.

‘I think I may be able to enjoy battling.’

Harrison’s hand unconsciously moved to his armor.

His voice came out as if he was vomiting something hot.

“Sir! Understood!”

*****

For now, Roan returned alone to rose troop.

‘I wanted to bring him immediately……’

But he wasn’t in a situation where he could bring him immediately, as they were in different troops.

‘On top of that, this isn’t the correct time.’

Roan looked at the south sky.

‘I have to go to Potter region.’

A scandal that happened in the past 20 years, and one of the best and biggest scandals that could be picked with your fingers.

Roan waited for that huge scandal until now.

‘There’s two months left until the landslide happens.’

Before that, he had to go to Maiel’s mountain that belonged to viscount Potter.

‘First, I will have to request for a vacation when the merits awards end.’

A plan that will last one month, or three months if it takes long.

‘If I finish what I had planned, I will get back to the squad.’

His life will start anew from then.

‘Until then, it’s obvious for Harrison, but I also have to polish the skills of Pierce, Glenn, and the other members of the 12th squad.’

His chest beat.

‘I will make my own squad, my corps with them as the center.’

And as he walks step by step, he will one day surpass being a great general, and become a monarch.

Magnificence and heroic temper fills his heart.

*****

The next day, the soldiers that participated in the monster subjugation in Pedian’s plain, started to withdraw in order.

The 7th corps were the very last.

After finishing the preparations plentily for 10 days, the genuine withdrawal started.

‘A lot of things happened in this short time.’

Roan’s feelings were new.

It was marvelous having returned to the times when he was an 18 year old greenhorn, but most of all, it was more marvelous having become a 5 class adjutant in only some months.

‘Until now, is it quite a successful life?’

He also gained reliable subordinates.

‘From now on, what kind of things will happen?’

He remembered most of the big scandals, but there was no guarantee that those things will happen exactly as his memory.

‘However, I have the 20 years of experience with me.’

If he got a hold of himself and acted calmly, even if some urgent situation came, he would be able to overcome it.

His chest kept beating fiercely.

‘Has life been so fun like this?’

A smile appears on his face.

The march was certainly exhausted, but his smile became denser.

Everything in the world seemed beautiful.

Chapter 31




The 7th corps arrived at Ipen’s castle, located at the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom, after 10 days of marching.

The lord of Ipen’s castle and the commander of the 7th corps, baron Aaron Tate, started to do a merits award for the troops before they left to their respective headquarters.

The turn of rose troop was quite near the end, so they made camp and rested.

The time where generals and commanders obviously lie down but also normal soldiers rest while completely lying down.

But Roan used that time to train on his spear skills.

‘I have to master the things I remember the fastest possible.’

The Pierce spearmanship, which he mastered and learnt for the past 20 years while roaming the battlefield.

And even excluding that, he remembered quite many spear skills, combat skills, etc.

‘I have to train and keep training until my body moves on its own.’

Ever since Roan returned to the past, he had pushed himself to the limits.

Because of that, his strength, stamina, movements, and of course, spear skills got so good it became noticeable to the eyes.

‘Pierce’s help was also big.’

Roan threw away his personal time and kept training on Pierce’s spear stances.

‘Because of that he could grind and polish his senses to be more sensitive.’

Although his skills wasn’t as good as before he died, but even so, it was quite close.

‘Even so, it’s still lacking.’

The moment he gets satisfied he would stagnate.

Roan whipped himself in case he got lazy.

He focused on training his spear skills on an empty ground on the corner of the camp as usual.

Blow.

His hair blows because of the west wind.

Pabat!

His spear dances while cutting through the wind.

Spear skills that don’t have any unnecessary movements.

His spear skills that were for practical use slowly started to become softer.

‘Huh?’

Then, he felt a presence approaching him.

“Whew.”

He breathed out slowly and stopped his spear.

At the same time, a big builded man appeared.

A really familiar face.

It was vice squad commander Austin.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

Quite excited words.

“What happened?”

As Roan smiled faintly and asked back, Austin raised his thumb.

“Our turn finally came.”

He smiled so brightly to the point his teeth showed and continued saying.

“It’s finally sir adjutant Roan’s turn for the merits awards.”

“Ah….”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

‘Has it been 4 days since we arrived at Ipen’s castle?’

Meanwhile, quite a lot of troops finished their merits awards and returned to their own headquarters.

‘My turn finally came.’

He had already decided on what he wanted.

‘I have to get inside Brent’s library.’

It won’t be hard.

The current Brent’s library was nothing but a name.

Although the nobles were allowed to get in, it had been quite a while that even they hadn’t got in.

‘It’s a situation where they shouldn’t deny my proposal to sightsee the library.’

But of course, this was Roan’s thoughts.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

Austin asked once more time to the absent minded Roan.

Only then did Roan nod late.

“Right. Should we go?”

Roan slowly moved his feet.

As he crossed the camp and arrived at the troop commander’s tent that was in the middle of the camp, Gale was already outside waiting for him.

“Your turn finally came. You waited long, right?”

“That’s not true.”

Roan slightly bent down.

Gale took a step and continued saying.

“If it’s the commander of the army corps, you will be able to ask him anything. Then, tell him honestly, without being aware of him.”

He kept explaining Roan about Aaron’s temperament, and the methods about the merits award while moving towards Ipen’s castle.

‘So he likes direct things rather than hitting around the bush.’

Roan put a smile.

These little bits of informations become a great strength later on.

Meanwhile, Gale and Roan passed through the castle’s door and arrived at the headquarters of the army corps.

“Sir!”

The soldiers that were guarding the entrance, noticed Gale and saluted.

Gale nodded lightly and moved his feet.

He was really excited about what price would Roan get on the merits awards.

“It’s troop commander Gale from rose troops, and class 5 adjutant Roan.”

As soon as they informed to the assembly, the huge door opened.

‘It’s big.’

The scale of the assembly was quite big.

The ceiling was high and the space was wide.

Wooden chairs, that had long backrest, were aligned to the sides and on a slightly higher platform on the center, a huge table was placed.

‘Corps commander Aaron Tate.’

Beyond the table, they could see Aaron.

He was in the middle of looking at the many gathered documents.

Gale stood in front of the table and saluted.

“It’s troop commander Gale, from rose troop.”

Roan also bent down, following him.

“It’s class 5 adjutant Roan, from rose troop.”

Only then did Aaron, that was busy with the documents, raise his head.

The 6 middle aged men that were seated next to him put interesting expressions.

‘So that guy is Roan.’

‘He is called the ghost of the battlefield.’

‘The guy with the biggest merits in our 7th corps.’

The middle aged men were staff officers that served Aaron.

Although their ranks was that of staff officer, it could be said that they were one rank higher than Gale.

‘So troop commander Richard of the special troop wants him huh?’

‘Then it really means that he’s a fine guy.’

‘Should I bring him to our side?’

The eyes of the staff all check of Roan’s body.

And Roan also didn’t not notice their sights and interest.

‘I will do what I have to.’

Right now, he had to get in Brent’s castle, and after that he would get a vacation and go to Potter’s region.

There were no plans at all about moving to another troop or serving another troop commander.

“Mendel. Read the merits report.”

At Aaron’s words, a middle aged man that was next to him and looked modest took out a thick piece of paper and extended it.

“I will start from when he discovered the goblin army waiting in ambush at Ale gorge.”

Mendel started to read the merits Roan achieved minutely from when he returned to the past. Just like the inundation tactic, and what he did on Pedian’s plain.

Just by saying that there were more than ten monster commanders he had slain, everybody sighed in amazement.

On top of that, at the word of having rescued the allied troops that were about to get annihilated, everybody put surprised expressions.

‘Didn’t they say that he had just finished his training?’

‘For an 18 year old guy to render this kind of merits!’

‘He rendered even more merits than what I have heard.’

The staff got astounded and looked at Roan.

On the other hand, Aaron’s expression was still calm.

He opened his eyes sharply and looked at Roan’s body in detail.

‘He wouldn’t be hiding his identity, right?’

Aaron got up and moved next to Roan.

Mendel got surprised for a moment, but he didn’t stop reading the report.

Swish.

Aaron grabbed Roan’s wrist.

‘Huh?’

Roan hurriedly lowered his head and frowned.

‘What is it?’

He couldn’t understand the sudden actions.

And then, a weird feeling entered from the wrist.

Just as if he was tickled with a cold feather.

It was a feeling that Roan also knew about.

‘It’s mana.’

He had also been through this quite few times because of Pierce, in his past life.

And now, Aaron was pouring his mana inside of Roan.

Actions to check if Roan had mastered some kind of mana or not.

‘Is he dubious about me?’

Roan bit his lower lips.

There was no need to unnecessarily buy suspicion.

He softened his stiff expression and lent him his wrist.

“Whew.”

After a moment, Aaron spat a long breath and returned to his place.

A difficult smile was on his face, which you wouldn’t be able to discover if you didn’t see his mouth in detail.

‘He had never learnt mana. Then…….’

It meant that he had slain the monster commanders with simple spear skills.

‘He slayed an orc troop commander with spear skills that don’t contain mana?’

An honestly difficult merit to believe.

‘Was he lucky? Or were his spear skills that outstanding?’

Whatever side it was, it was clear that it was a big strength.

‘If he was lucky, so be it. If his spear skills are excellent, then there is a need for that.’

Soon, happiness could be seen on Aaron’s face.

“WIth this, I will finish the report.”

Meanwhile, the report about Roan’s merits had finished.

“Amazing.”

A really amazed voice.

“It’s a really amazing merit.”

“There’s no flaw in it.”

“It’s outstanding.”

Even the staff officers that were listening to it, raised their thumbs.

“I was lucky.”

Roan lowered his head.

A not excessive humility.

He didn’t want to hide the merits.

Aaron stared at Roan’s face as if he was going to pierce it, and then asked bluntly.

“As the merit is this big, the reward must also be big. Is there something you want?”

It came.

Gale slightly bent down and gave him eye signs.

‘If there’s anything you want, say it honestly.’

He remembered the advice Gale told him when they were coming to the headquarters.

Roan slightly bent down and looked at Aaron.

“There is one thing I want.”

“Oh.”

Aaron let out a slight exclamation.

He was thinking maybe, but he hadn’t expected that he really had something he wanted.

He continued saying with an interesting expression.

“It’s good because your character is fresh. Right, tell me. If it’s not excessive, I will listen to you.”

Roan breathed in.

An instinctive choice.

A really short silence made Aaron restless.

Roan smiled faintly and laughed while replying with a low voice but with strength.

“I want to see Brent’s library.”

Boom.

At that instant, Aaron’s face get clearly contorted.

Not only him, the faces of the staff and even Gale’s got nicely contorted.

‘Brent library?’

‘He only wants to see Brent’s library for his reward?’

‘Isn’t he out of his mind?’

They all seemed prostrated.

Aaron got ahold of himself late and forced a laugh.

“Ho! So you want to see Brent’s library? Is that really the only thing you want?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan slightly bent down.

He understood how Gale, the staff and Aaron were thinking.

‘They shouldn’t be able to understand as to why I want to go and see an old library that nobody visits.’

Even Roan, if it wasn’t for that object, he wouldn’t even have looked at it.

And then, a bald man that was seated next to Aaron frowned and said.

“But wanting to see Brent library means……..”

He dimmed the last part and put an expression as if it was hard to believe.

“Do maybe you know how to read?”

At those words, it was obvious for Aaron, but even Gale put a really surprised expression.

‘He knows about letters?’

‘He knows how to read?’

Something they hadn’t thought about.

‘Right. If it’s the guy that developed that appalling strategy and tactic, he may be able to write and read.’

Everybody looked at Roan with expressions saying maybe.

Roan smiled faintly and replied shortly.

“Yes. I’m able to read and write.”

“Oh!”

Aaron let out a loud exclamation.

‘For a guy that was only a normal soldier until just now knows how to read and write, huh.’

Knowing words was an outstanding ability.

Excluding the staff officers of the 7th corps, the troops commanders and some adjutants, nobody knew about words.

There was no one among normal soldiers that knew how to read and write.

And actually, even in Roan’s case, he could barely get the chance to learn after his mid thirties.

Because as he became squad commander from the 1st spearmen squad, he became in need to know how to do so.

‘Well, it’s also partly because of Pierce.’

To read the letters Pierce sent him at times, he need to learn the words.

‘If I learnt a bit earlier, the path to success should have opened much faster.’

And that was also one of the regrets in his choices.

Anyways, the Roan right now knew how to read and write at the age of 18.

‘The more I know about him, the more I want him.’

‘If I can only bring him below me, I will be able to use him well.’

The eyes of the staff officers start to shine with a conspicuous color.

Rolar felt that he heard noises of his body’s worth rising.

Gale bit his lower lip.

‘Whatever I do, I have to hold him to stay with me. I can’t get this competent person to be stolen by another person.’

Regret came flowing late.

‘It shouldn’t have been 5 class, but I should have at least made him class 3 adjutant.’

But it wasn’t late yet.

‘I will have to reward him once again.’

Gale’s eyes shone and emitted light.

Then, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“If you know how to read and write, somewhere like Brent’s library is quite a charming place. Although it is worn out and old, it’s still one of the best libraries in the western parts of Rinse kingdom. But……”

The last part of his sentence blurs.

A weird expression shows on his face.

“Because Brent library hasn’t been taken care of well, it’s no different to ruins. Rather than sight seeing that worn out library, what about receiving another reward?”

He lightly clapped his hands.

At the back side of the assembly, one soldier appeared with a cool spear and two fist sized leather bags.

“It’s a spear I bought when I went to the capital of Miller. It was made by one of the blacksmith that’s on the top three of Rinse kingdom, by making tests over and over. I will give you this and silver coins. How is it?”

A gently asking voice.

Roan looked at the spear and the two leather bags.

‘It’s certainly a good spear. And there are plenty of silver coins. But……….’

He had the travias spear with him, which he couldn’t use yet, and if he got determined on it, he would be able to earn a much higher amount of money.

There was only one thing he needed the most right now.

It was permission to get in Brent library.

‘It’s taking a risk.’

Roan lowered his head.

“There’s nothing I desire aside of seeing Brent library.”

A polite yet firm way of talking.

At that moment, Mendel frowned.

“How conceited. You dare to our corps commander………”

“It’s fine.”

Aaron shook his hand and smiled faintly.

‘How funny. Does it mean that a good spear and two bags of silver is lacking?’

He interlocked his fingers and rested his chin on it.

“Fine. Then I will raise your rank to class 3 adjutant. And if you want, I will also give you a small house near rose troop’s headquarters.”

Exceptional manners and conditions.

‘Even so, will you still keep insisting that you want to see Brent library?’

An expression as if he was dying to know what kind of answer he will give.

Aaron’s corner of eyes and mouth busily raise up and down.

‘Is he testing me?’

Roan slightly turned up his head and looked at Aaron’s two eyes.

He remembered the words Gale had said.

‘The corps commander doesn’t like dressing things up, and likes direct things.’

Then, the direct action was the best.

Roan lowered his head again and replied.

“I have already received many rewards at the merits awards. I received a prize and I also became an adjutant. The spear and prize you have told me about, give that to the ordinary soldiers that risked their lives at the front. It’s because of them that the battle at Ale gorge, inundation tactic at Prely river, and the subjugation of Pedian’s plain turned out to be a victory.”

“Oh.”

Aaron, the staff and Gale all let out exclamations.

‘Good.’

‘He has the qualities of a good commander.’

‘Excellent.’

A satisfied expression.

Roan looked at Aaron’s face for a moment and bent his head.

“There’s nothing aside seeing Brent library that I desire.”

“Mmm.”

A low exclamation flowed from Aaron’s mouth.

“So you say that you will deny the promotion, house, the spear bought from the kingdom and the silver coin bags, right?”

“Yes.”

Roan was still with his head lowered.

Aaron just looked at him and shook his head.

“Brent library is a place that is only possible to enter by nobles…….”

He dimmed the last part of the sentence and clapped his hands.

Clap!

A light sound.

“Fine. If that’s your wish, I can only listen to it.”

At that instant a bright smile appeared from Roan, that was bending his head.

‘It’s done.’

He hid his expression and replied with a voice filled with strength.

“Thank you.”

He got the thing he wanted.

At least until now, everything was happening as he wanted.

Chapter 32




Aaron took a big piece of paper and stamped it.

“It’s the symbol of our family. If you show this, you will be able to get in Brent library.”

“Thank you.”

Roan bent down deeply and saluted.

“And also take the spear and the reward.”

“Yes?”

At Aaron’s words, Roan put a surprised expression.

“I can’t end the merits award with just letting you see Brent’s library. Even so, I was planning to give this to you, so take it.”

A fresh decision.

Roan didn’t decline and humbly received the spear and the bag of silver.

‘I received more than I thought.’

And the merits awards ended like that.

Roan saluted towards Aaron and the staff commanders and got out of the assembly.

Gale said that he still had things remaining to do, and he remained next to Aaron.

‘Should I go immediately?’

I still had a lot of time before night.

‘Let’s go right now.’

He wanted to find that object even an hour earlier.

Roan got out of the troop’s headquarters and went towards Brent’s library located at the middle of Ipen’s castle.

A familiar distance.

As he walked down the well built road, he saw an antique building far away.

The building the magician Louis Brent, that was around this region, built before dying.

‘The place where Brent’s ring is sleeping.’

Roan’s eyes twisted softly.

*****

Louis Brent.

A magician that was from the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom, of Ipen’s castle.

He became a magician for the royal family of Rinse kingdom after he became a 6 circle master at the age of 57. And after working for 10 years for the royal family, he returned to Ipen’s castle and died after living for 5 more years.

Before dying, he built Brent’s library with the permission of Rinse kingdom and left behind his books. After Louis died, many magicians, scholars and nobles found the library to read and study the books he left, but as more time passed, the people going there became scarce.

There’s not even a grain.

There are only simple books you can find anywhere.

The evaluation of the ones that visited Brent library.

As a huge amount of visitors came here, even the rule that only nobles were allowed of entrance appeared.

Because of that, this place became a ghost library that no one looked at anymore.

‘To have built it this well, but to not be able to utilize it properly.’

Roan looked at the entrance of the antique building while standing outside of it.

‘Ian Phillips used the library and academy positively.’

Ian, that was an unparalleled strategist, showed his extraordinary skills even with regards to politics and the government.

The product of his skills that made the roads maintained and the academy revitalized.

‘For a competent man, it was important to recruit, but even more so to raise.’

Ian believed like that.

He thought that just with recruiting, it will end up hitting a dead end.

‘As the academy got revitalized, many extraordinary commanders, warriors and scholars appeared.’

However, that couldn’t end up with a good result.

Because a problem that even Ian hadn’t predicted happened.

‘If that guy just hadn’t made that revolt……’

The guy called as the mad monarch.

With the appearance of that guy, Ian’s military enhancing books all became foam and disappeared.

‘Now that I think about it, he would only be 10 years old now.’

He felt bitter.

‘I will have to meet him before he turns crazy.’

For the peace of Rinse kingdom, no, for the precious lives of the civilians.

“Whew. But let’s first do what’s in front of me.”

Roan covered the stuffy thoughts and moved his feet.

He opened the door of the library that was shut tight and as he got in, a bad smell pinched the tip of his nose.

‘The smell of mold.’

The maintenance was more of a mess than what he had thought.

On the walls and ceilings that had pretty patterns engraved could be seen it covered with spider webs and black dust.

“Who is it?”

A young man that was guarding the entrance stood up.

Roan opened the paper he received from Aaron.

“I want to get in.”

“Ah…… It’s the symbol of Sir Baron Tate.”

“The young man smiled faintly and pointed towards the library.”

“You can go in towards there.”

“Thank you.”

Roan saluted promptly and opened the door of the library.

Kigigi

Wood twisting sounded displeasingly.

Boom.

As he closed the door and got in, he saw twenty bookshelves turned over.

A bigger scale than what he had in mind.

‘Where was Louis Brent’s biography?’

Roan checked the books on the bookshelves meticulously.

As he passed the 6th bookshelf, and was on the 7th one.

The corner of his mouth rose slightly.

‘It’s here.’

The seventh bookshelf.

And at the lowest place where he had to kneel down.

There was the biography of Louis Brent.

In Louis Brent’s biography, that was comprised of 20 books, were recorded the things from when he was born until he died.

‘Books filled with a lot of useless things.’

The evaluation of the world.

Because of that, there were almost no people that read all the biography from start to end.

‘I have to take out the books starting from the 1st one to the 20th one in order.’

Roan took out the first book and went towards a table located on a corner.

A table of which the upper layer was thicker than the others.

Roan placed the book on the upper right part of the table and grabbed it again and went towards the bookshelf.

‘I have to repeat this until the 20th one.’

A really troublesome process.

‘It’s because of this that no one discovered the hidden ring in the table.’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

The reason Brent’s ring got discovered was simply by luck.

After 6 years from now on, Brent’s library that was being maintained because of the mess, a fire produced.

‘Then, all the books that were exposed got lost and even half of the tables got burnt.’

And they discovered the ring in the upper layer in the process of organizing the half-burnt tables.

‘The ring was taken by Baron Aaron Tate.’

According to what was told to the world, Brent’s ring was quite an excellent artifact.

It was known that according to the amount of mana you had, you would be able to use the sealed magic and properties it had.

And of course, these truths were all revealed by the owner of the ring, Aaron Tate.

‘There’s no way he revealed everything.’

But just with the revealed truth, it was certain that it was an extraordinary artifact.

‘It was really fortunate that they discovered Brent’s ring along with Louis’s letter.’

In the letter, the method explaining how to open the upper layer was recorded.

And Aaron revealed all of the contents.

‘Because there was no way to take off the ring before the owner died.’

Because of that, even a normal person like Roan could know where Brent’s ring was hidden, and remembered how to find it.

He smiled faintly and went towards the table while holding the last 20th book.

“Whew.”

A nervous face.

Roan let out a short sigh and placed the book on the top right part of the table.

Pat.

At that moment, a faint light started to glow following the corner of the table.

‘Damn.’

At the unexpected situation, he hurriedly turned to look at the entrance.

The door was fortunately closed.

Anxiousness appeared on Roan’s face.

‘Disappear quickly. Quickly.’

The light seemed to realize how Roan was feeling, and it soon disappeared.

Open

At the same time, a space appeared in the middle of the table and it started to open to the sides.

Tung

From the opened space, a square box popped out.

A box the size of a book.

Roan carefully opened the box.

As soon as he opened the lid, he saw a letter the size of a palm.

My name is Louis Brent. I will leave a small gift to the one that read all of my biography to the end.

The contents of the letter, that started just like he remembered, was the same. It was written that you had to place the books from the 1st one to the 20th one in order, in the table Louis appreciated, to be able to receive the small gift.

I hope you use it well.

A brusque finish.

Roan folded the finely and put it on his chest.

“So this is Brent’s ring.”

A worn out ring inside the box.

It was a coarse ring that didn’t have any patterns, just as if was made roughly with a piece of steel.

Roan carefully grabbed the ring.

“Whew.”

A short breath.

He put the ring on the index finger of his left hand.

Jiiing

At that moment, the ring shrank along a short vibration and transformed to be just the right size of the finger.

Shine

The coarse ring that didn’t have any patterns shone brightly and returned to its original shape.

An unfailing and cheap ring on the exterior.

‘I’m rather glad.’

There was nothing good in attracting attention.

‘There are a lot of people among nobles that were attached to jewels.

And then, a fresh feeling spread from the ring as the center.

‘Ah. So this is the temperature regulation.’

The actual Roan didn’t know how to handle mana.

But even so, he could still use some basic functions it had.

And one of those was temperature regulation.

‘Now, I will be able to keep a suitable temperature on spring, summer, autumn, and winter.’

It meant that from now on, he wouldn’t die from the heat or cold.

On top of that, you could even control your body heat.

Because of that, he wouldn’t sweat from the upcoming training or battles, even if he moved his body.

However, there was another feature that Roan really liked.

‘This much is amazing, but to also have the feature to hide your presence.’

A function to hide your presence.

It didn’t perfectly hide your presence as outstanding assassins or murderers, but even so, it had an effect of hiding your presence to a certain point.

This was a more useful function than what you thought.

‘It makes my actions difficult to predict.’

People gave off a sign before doing an action.

And on the battlefield, that point was mostly associated with intent, and indications of the body.

There was no bigger advantage than this on the battlefield.

‘On top of that, when I get to learn how to use mana I will be able to use the hidden abilities and also improve functions such as this one.’

The abilities Aaron showed on the past life.

‘Fireball, magic arrow, blink, shield, healing, etc.’

Because of that, he who was a lord of a military castle, got promoted to commander of the eastern parts of Rinse kingdom after he got a hand on Brent’s ring.

‘I rather feel sorry for Sir Baron Aaron Tate.’

Because he took the chance for him to become a commander.’

‘Anyways, I need to learn mana to be able to use all of the functions this ring has.’

His two eyes lit up with fire in them.

‘I will go to Potter region.’

At that place, there was an opportunity, no, a future.

Roan organized his thoughts and grabbed the empty box.

‘First, let’s return to our troop’s camp.’

He got what he wanted.

He didn’t have any need to keep roaming in Brent’s library anymore.

He put the box back on the table.

Place. Sushh.

The table returned to its original shape after a light sound.

Roan moved his feet towards the entrance with a relieved expression.

‘Ah!’

Then, he saw the 20th book of Louis Brent’s biography placed on the table.

‘Even so, he has given me a big gift……’

Roan returned and after he grabbed the book he walked towards the bookshelf.

“I will use it well.”

A short greeting.

It was when he was planning to go back after he carefully put the book back.

Tuk!

The book, that was put back firmly, got bounced off.

“Why did this get ou……”

Roan grabbed the book and after looking at the bookshelf without thinking of anything, he froze still.

“What’s this?”

The place that certainly had to be empty.

‘Box?’

There was a box he hadn’t seen there.

‘Will there maybe be another treasure?’

His chest beat.

He brought up the memories inside his head.

But however he thought, it was something he didn’t remember.

Roan carefully grabbed the box.

Click.

After opening the hand sized box, he saw a strange object inside of it.

‘This is just like…….’

Chapter 33




‘Drops of water?’

Inside the small box, there were 2 objects the shape of waterdrops.

Waterdrops the size of nails.

Roan didn’t touch it and meticulously checked the inside of the box.

‘Mm.”

Then he saw a note sticked on the inner part of the lid.

I’m leaving the real treasure to the one that treated my biography carefully even after having gotten the treasure.

A smile appears on Roan’s mouth.

‘He’s thoughtful.’

He hadn’t even guessed that he would make this kind of arrangement.

And on the note, it was also written what the two objects were.

“Huk!”

Roan, that was reading down the note without thinking of anything, gulped down air.

His eyes that tremble.

‘Thi, this is Kalian’s tears?’

Kalian’s tear.

It was an object that Roan had only heard of in rumours.

‘For Louis Brent to be in possession of Kalian’s tears.’

One of the treasures the dragon Kalian left to the humans before it hid itself 200 years ago.

It was called as Kalian’s tears because it had the shape of water drops and it was known that there were only 10 pairs of it and that it had really strong functions.

If you put Kalian’s tears on each of your eyes, your eyesight will magnify greatly and develop a technique that involves eyesight.

On the note Louis left, there was also the instructions written in it.

The only regretful thing was that it wasn’t written as to how Louis obtained Kalian’s tears and how he preserved it.

Roan looked at Kalian’s tears and breathed in.

‘Did Baron Aaron Tate have gotten it?’

After 6 years, a fire starts and he coincidentally got ahold of Brent’s ring.

This was everything that was told to the world.

Roan’s eyes sharpened.

‘He probably did.’

He wasn’t certain, but there was a high possibility.

‘Certainly, after the fire, baron Aaron Tate’s swordsmanship increased by leaps.’

It was clear that Brent’s ring was an outstanding artifact, but it was impossible that his swordsmanship improved with just that.

‘With Kalian’s tear his eyesight developed explosively.’

Just with the known effects, you could see things far away as if it was right in front of your eyes, and you could figure out a lot more information in that short time.

‘Not only that, but although there was a limit to the times and time, they also said that there was a function of being able to see the movements of things more slowly.’

An outstanding ability, just like it says.

‘If it’s Kalian’s tears, i’m not even jealous of Pierce’s eyesight.’

His heart beat roughly.

If it was Kalian’s tear, he would be able to freely use spear skills on a much higher level than before.

Swish

Roan grabbed one Kalian’s tear really carefully and put it on his right eye.

‘Mmm.’

In that instant, a cold and hot feeling swept through his eyes alternatingly.

Roan didn’t get perplexed and continued putting on the remaining Kalian’s tear on his left eye.

He felt the cold and hot feeling again.

Blink. Blink.

Roan carefully blinked and slowly looked at his surroundings.

‘There’s nothing different.’

The scene in front of him didn’t have anything different.

Only, his eyes felt softer and more comfortable.

‘The functions shouldn’t have disappeared, right?’

Roan looked at the far away table with a slightly nervous feeling.

His sight got fixed on the side of a thin book that was on the table.

At that instant.

Swooooosh

The scene before his eyes got bigger as if it was being sucked, and the small and thin book that was far away now looked big.

‘Hup!’

Roan put a surprised face at the unexpected situation.

Analysis of Pushkin’s lake fishes.

He could see the really small title of the book clearly.

‘So this is one of the functions Kalian’s tear has.’

As he blinked again, the scene returned to the original form.

‘Amazing. It is indeed amazing, but…..’

It was certainly an overwhelming ability, but it was a situation he just couldn’t take casually.

‘I have to be able to use the abilities and functions skillfully.’

Right now, everything was unfamiliar.

The moment he amplifies his sight when he is fighting against enemies, his life would get in danger instead.

‘In the end, it’s training again.’

They say that you have to thread the pearls for it to become a treasure.

Roan was thinking of doing some training to use Kalian’s tear to its true worth.

‘In my past life, I have lived solely through effort without even having these sorts of things.’

The situation had certainly become better.

Based on his efforts, he may really be able to become a monarch.

Click

Roan only took out the note out of the box and put it back on the bookshelf.

And after he placed back the 20th book of Brent’s biography, it returned to its original shape.

“Whew.”

He obtained something he had expected, and something he hadn’t.

Roan stood in front of the entrance and organized his clothes.

There was only one thing that had changed since when he entered.

It was the ring he put on his left thumb.

However, there was no need to check cautiously, because it looked like a worn out and old metal ring.

‘Let’s go.’

Roan carefully opened the door and got out.

And then, he heard a childish voice.

“Are you Roan?”

An unfamiliar voice.

Roan frowned and looked at the place the voice was heard at.

A kid that seemed to be on his early 10s.

The kid that had white skin, well trimmed brown hair, and clean and high classed clothes, seemed clearly like a noble even at first glance.

‘The librarian is also really nervous.’

The young man that was guarding the entrance also had a really nervous expression.

Roan checked on the kid attentively and moved his feet.

‘Why is he so familiar?’

He didn’t know where, but he gave a familiar feeling.

Roan stood in front of the kid and slightly bent his head.

“Yes. I’m Roan.”

He couldn’t reply casually just because he was a kid.

Roan was still a commoner, and only a class 5 adjutant of the 7th corps at that.

If the kid was a noble, and a son of a prestigious noble family, he had to be careful on even mixing words with him.

The kid smiled brightly and extended his hand.

“Nice to meet you. My name is Ian. I’m the eldest son of count Philips.”

Boom.

At that moment, Roan received a shock similar as getting hit in the back of his head.

‘Ian Philips? He is that outstanding genius strategist Ian Philips?’

He looked at Ian’s face with an absent minded expression.

Ian smiled brightly and tilted his head.

“Is there something on my face?”

A childish voice that shows its childishness.

Only then did Roan get a hold of himself and grab Ian’s hands.

“Ah, that’s not it. If it’s count Philips, he’s from a quite prestigious noble family…….”

“Well, everything is just an empty name.”

Ian lightly retorted and shook his hand.

The hand of Roan, that became rougher because of the battles through the months, felt strongly different compared to Ian’s soft hands.

“You are more different to what I have thought. I thought that you would look more intelligent.”

Ian smiled brightly and kept staring at Roan’s face.

“I really wanted to meet you.”

At the continued words, Roan’s head became stuffed.

‘He wanted to meet me?’

Even on his past life, they hadn’t met alone even once.

Roan didn’t reply hurriedly and just kept looking at Ian’s face.

Ian pointed the entrance of the library with his finger.

“Shall we talk outside?”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan slightly bent his head.

Even so as he was a commoner and Ian a noble, and the eldest son of count Philips on top of that, he couldn’t decline.

But before that, there was a huge curiosity.

‘Just why did he want to meet me?’

Somehow, his heart throbbed.

Ian got out of the library along with Roan, and went to a nearby small tea house.

‘So these guys are count Philip’s knights.’

Roan made some distance with Ian and got astounded when he looked at the guys following them from behind.

The flashy armor, the huge blade, and the intent coming out from their bodies was really overwhelming.

‘I have been conceited until now.’

It was obvious for the 7th corps, but the other corps that participated in the monster subjugation also thought that he had some skills.

Realistically speaking, there was no one that could follow Roan according toon the merits.

‘If I just kept it this way, I thought that I would obviously be able to become a great general, and perhaps also a monarch.’

Even when he was at Brent’s library just now, he thought of that.

However, now that he saw the count’s knights, he got to realize just how much of a frog inside a well he was.

‘I was at a level where I could boast among normal soldiers.’

Even so, he didn’t get depressed or frustrated.

‘Wait a little. Just a little.’

He was confident on being able to become stronger than count Philip’s knights.

If he progressed withon his plans steadily and without slacking on putting in effort, he would be able to pass them aton a quite early time.

‘But of course, everything must happen as I have planned.’

It won’t be easy.

Even Ian appearing before him was something he hadn’t planned.

“Do you want to drink something?”

“Water is enough for me.”

“Really? Then, I will ask you for a glass of water and a wet tea.”

Ian skillfully made the order and looked at Roan as if it was interesting.

“I don’t like hitting around the bush. The reason I came looking for you is because of the inundation tactic at Prely river.”

A smile appears on his mouth.

“They say that it was you that came up with it?”

It was a question Roan hadn’t expected, but he didn’t get perplexed and slightly nodded.

“Yes. It was me.”

Of course, precisely speaking, it would have been the kid Ian in front of him reporting it 5 years from now on.

Ian clapped.

Clap!

“It was a really outstanding tactic.”

He sticked out his face in front of the table.

“I also thought that it would have been good to make an inundation tactic when I looked at the map. However, I judged that there wasn’t the necessary amount of water. Just how did you know that there was a reservoir there?”

Words spat out quickly without even breathing once.

Roan put on a bitter smile.

‘It’s also something I got to know after I read your report 5 years from now on.’

But of course, he couldn’t say that.

Roan replied with a calm expression.

“I think that the tactics and strategies are as important as strong weapons and number of soldiers on war and battles. If you have a good strategy, you will be able to defeat thousands, and tens of thousands of enemies with just a few hundreds. So then, how will we be able to make a good strategy?”

It wasn’t a question expecting for an answer.

Ian looked at Roan with shining eyes and waited for the next words.

“I think that a massive amount of information and systematically organized one can make for a good root for strategies.”

“Ah!”

At Roan’s words, Ian let out a low exclamation.

“That means that to make a good strategy and tactic, you had already grasped the information in the surroundings of Prely river, right?”

Words hitting dead center.

Roan slowly nodded.

“That’s right. If you collect and analyze even small information that other people don’t even look at, it will become a great help one day.”

“Mmm.”

Ian fell in his thoughts.

Roan just sat there and didn’t dare to say anything.

‘It seems like he realized something.’

He realized that Ian was deep his his thoughts organizing things.

Meanwhile the water and wet tea came, but no one touched it.

After a while, Ian clapped his hands and smiled brightly.

Clap!

“Good. It became a really good study.”

He, who finished his studies, looked at Roan and raised his thumb.

“Thanks to you, I became able to draw a picture I like a lot.”

“A picture?”

“Yes. I have a habit of drawing the things I want to do or my dreams inside of my head. And every time, various pictures come out. A cool picture, a roughly drawn picture, a messy picture. And among that, I pick only the cool pictures and draw it myself.”

“Ah…..”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

Ian smiled brightly and took in a deep breath.

“The importance of information……. A really cool picture has formed. And now, I have to draw it myself.”

He emptied the cup of tea in an instant.

“Kuha. Sorry. I want to immediately draw the picture, and I can’t hold it in.”

Ian stood up and extended his hand.

Roan lightly grabbed his hand and nodded.

“It’s fine. Instead, show me that cool picture to me.”

“Of course. Half of this picture was drawn by you.”

Ian lent out a small handkerchief from his chest.

“It’s a handkerchief with symbols of our family. If you come to our place later on, show that. Then, they will treat you as a precious guest.”

“Thank you.”

Roan carefully received the handkerchief and put it on his chest.

“Then, come visit me.”

Ian shook his hand and hurriedly moved his feet.

The knights that were enjoying their teas at nearby tables, hurriedly stood up from their seats.

And then, he heard the excited voice of Ian.

“It’s an information organization. First, I will make an information organization inside my territory.”

“An information organization? If it’s information you want, you can buy it at guilds or thieves guilds.”

The knights that were following behind him tilted their heads and said.

The last voice of Ian was heard before he got out of the tea house.

“That’s not the picture Roan and I have pictured.”

That was the end.

Ian left a bustling atmosphere and left the tea house.

Roan got astounded.

‘So this is how the genius looked ion his childhood.’

It was hectic but somewhat pleasant.

‘By the way, i’m curious as to how the picture he drew with me will look.’

Roan placed his hand on his left chest.

And there was the handkerchief with count Philip’s symbol.

‘Did a relation that didn’t exist on my past life happen?’

A kind of reliable feeling.

‘If I can just do it I will take Ian Philips to my side.’

If it’s a friend good, and if it’s an ally all the better.

Even until now, it was something he hadn’t expected at all.

Just how much of an influence did today’s meeting give to Ian.

Chapter 34




As soon as the merits awards ended, Roan immediately prepared for the withdrawal of the troop.

He would be returning in several days.

There was excitement on the faces of the troop members.

But of course, even between them, Roan didn’t slack on his training.

And especially including the basic squad training and spear training, he also started another training to make better use of Kalian’s tear.

Pat!

Roan quickly ran past a bulky rocky zone.

Even though there were big and small rocks, Roan’s feet didn’t have any trace of hesitation on stepping over them.

As smooth as flowing water.

However Roan, that was running over the rocks, felt stifled.

‘It’s slow. Slow.’

Because of Kalian’s tear, his sight-related abilities improved explosively.

Even if he saw the same scene, he could grasp a lot more information than before.

While he was running over the rocks without stopping, he could clearly see the angle of how the rock was tilted, and how big it was.

Tadat!

Roan chose a point to land his feet with the sight information as the background and then flew his body.

And a small problem appeared right here.

He had already finished grasping the information for the other point, but his body still hadn’t reached the first point.

In simple words, his body couldn’t follow his sight at all.

‘In this situation, what’s the meaning of knowing where the spear will come from and where the arrow will fly from?’

Because he couldn’t dodge it.

‘In the end it’s training, training, and more training.’

He had to build more strength and stamina than he had now, move a bit faster, and make his body lighter.

And it was the same for his spear skills and combat abilities.

‘So what if I can see the weak points of my enemy? I have to be able to stab my spear into that point.’

He needed a lot more effort than before.

Tat!

Roan once again ran around the rocky zone.

Then, a familiar face appeared above one rock.

“Sir adjutant! Sir adjutant Roan!”

A white and soft look.

It was Glenn.

Roan stopped running and looked at Glenn.

At that instant, he saw the face of him that was far away as if it was right in front of his face.

“It’s the withdrawal. The withdrawal has started!”

An excited voice.

The withdrawal for rose troop had finally started.

‘Is it finally withdrawing.’

Until Beno castle, where the troop headquarters was located, was 2 days of distance.

After two days, the monster subjugation tactic in Pedian’s plain will truly end.

‘The end of war is always a happy thing.’

A faint smile appears on his face.

However, his smile turned to a bitter one.

‘No, it’s not the end of war, but is it resting?’

After one more year, the subjugation of Pedian’s plain will start again.

Not only that, but more monsters will appear.

On top of that, they were in a situation that the other kingdoms and empires could attack anytime.

War could never end.

‘How long will this break last?’

He didn’t expect in a big way.

Because the first time he grabbed the spear, he decided to live on the battlefield and die there.

“Even so, I want to live a long life in this life.”

At least, he wanted to get over 38.

Roan smiled faintly and shook his hand towards Glenn.

“I will go quickly!”

“Yes! Understood!”

Glenn yelled back and disappeared below the rock.

‘Does he like it that much……..’

Roan slowly moved his feet and burst out in laughter.

It was because of Glenn’s face, was delighted like a child.

Then a memory he had forgotten, no, a memory he tried to forget passed through his head.

‘Ah! His hometown was near Beno castle.’

Glenn’s hometown wasDio village, which was near Beno castle.

Be was born and raised there.

‘Meaning that…….’

She, from his memories, also grew up in that place.

A faint light shines on his face.

He felt a chill, but it wasn’t a displeasing feeling.

Only that he felt so nervous he couldn’t hide it.

*****

At the entrance of the opened Beno castle’s door.

The moment Roan got inside the castle, he opened his two eyes roundly and got surprised.

“Waaaaaa! Hurray rose troop!”

“Congratulations on returning safely!”

“Rose! Rose!”

Yells that hit the ears.

The people flocked over and an overwhelming crowd was lined up on the streets.

‘This much cheering…….’

He had roamed the battlefield for 20 years.

And during that time, he gained a lot of experiences in returning to a village or a castle, where there was the headquarters.

But the cheering he got at those times weren’t comparable to this.

‘When we won the war against Byron kingdom and returned victorious?’

Back then, they also received an amazing cheering.

However, that was when the fate of the country was on the line, and they returned victorious from the battle.

It wasn’t like returning from a monster subjugation.

When Roan looked at the people with a bewildered expression.

Among the crowd, cute girls appeared holding one blossom of rose each.

Gale and the adjutants got down from the horses as if they were waiting for it and slightly bent down.

The girls put the roses on the oxidized armours with shy expressions.

“Thank you.”

“Thanks.”

Gentle greetings.

“We are happy because you returned safely.”

The replies of the girls were also pretty and cute.

Then, a really small girl walked towards Roan.

She had come running after seeing his rank badge.

“I’m happy because you returned safely.”

The shy voice of the girl.

Roan hesitated for a moment and slightly bent down.

The girl moved her little hands and put the rose on one side of the armour.

“Thank you.”

Roan smiled faintly and stroke her head.

“Hee.”

The girl smiled brightly and then disappeared between the crowd.

Even during that, the troop members busily moved their feet.

“Waaa!”

“Rose! Rose!”

The cheers of the people continued.

Roan slightly turned his head and looked at the troop members.

Everyone were happily shaking their hands with an accustomed attitude.

‘It seems like they aren’t surprised of this cheer.’

It meant that the relationship between the troop and the commoners was good.

‘He’s a better commander than what I have thought.’

He had also felt that Gale was a good commander on his past life.

The look of him staying at Ale gorge at the ambush of the goblins to save even one more person.

‘He should have taken good care of the commoners as his troop members.’

So that would be the reason they received this kind of cheering.

He saw the headquarters far away.

Roan smiled faintly and placed his hand on his left chest.

His heart that was excited because of the cheers of the people, got even more excited.

Inside his chest there was the small piece of paper Gale had given him before arriving at Beno castle.

‘The squad members would like it.’

The corner of his mouth kept rising.

I want to quickly go back to the headquarters and show them the piece of paper.

‘They will make a fuss.’

He was certain of it.

Because there was no object like this yellow piece of paper that made him feel more flustered for the past 20 years.

Before he knew of it, the entrance of the headquarters was right in front of his eyes.

Now, it was the turn for the festival.

*****

“Is, is it true?!”

“Really! Is it really a vacation?”

“And it’s not 2 nights and 3 days, nor 3 nights and 4 days, but 4 nights and 5 days?!”

Expected reactions.

No, fiercer reactions than what he had expected.

Roan smirked and shook the piece of paper.

The piece of paper he had on his chest.

The piece of paper Gale gave to Roan before reaching Beno castle was a vacation permit.

And it wasn’t a normal one either.

‘To give the entire squad a vacation.’

It was a vacation permit not only for him, but for the entire squad.

“So pack your things already.”

After he finished saying those things, the squad members scarily packed their things.

Scenes of forcefully putting the things they grabbed into the bag.

And among them, there was also Austin that used to show a dignified and orderly attitude.

‘In the face of vacations, their dignity doesn’t have any use.’

Roan smiled faintly and just looked at the squad members.

It was Roan that lived like an ordinary spearman for more than 10 years on his past life.

He knew really well how big of a gift and happiness this vacations were for the normal soldiers.

The members of the 12th squad packed their things in an instant.

“It seems to be faster than when you prepare for battle?”

Roan put on an ill natured expression.

“Ahem.”

The squad members laughed awkwardly and coughed.

And then Austin, that was nearby him, asked carefully.

“Sir adjutant. You aren’t going to pack your things?”

Roan nodded with a calm expression.

“My hometown is in the mountainsides of Grain, so a vacation of 4 nights and 5 days is meaningless. I’m just planning on resting on the headquarters.”

“Ah……..”

Austin and the other squad members let out a low exclamation.

“Then, I will return earlier.”

Austin’s words.

Continued by the words of each and everyone of the squad.

“I will also return earlier.”

“Me too.”

“I will also come.”

When Roan was about to shake his hands while smiling brightly.

Austin clapped.

Clap.

“Then, how about dining together during this opportunity? Let’s drink some beer before we return back to the troop.”

As soon as he ended speaking, the squad members cheered.

“Oh! That’s good!”

“Good!”

The cheering sounds filled the room.

Austin shrugged his shoulders and looked at Roan.

An expression asking ‘What are you going to do if everyone wants it this much?’

Roan smirked and nodded.

“Even so, I was planning on drinking together with the squad members. If everyone is fine with it, let’s gather the day before we return to the troop and drink.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Everyone replied loudly.

‘They are having so much fun.’

Looking at how they are liking it this much, he felt gratified.

Clap.

Roan clapped and pushed the backs of the squad members.

“Well! Now return back to your hometowns! Go and rest well!”

The squad members got pushed as if they were being chased out of the room.

Then they saluted while holding their bags.

“Then, we will be going.”

Excited voices.

Roan laughed faintly and shook his hand.

“Go.”

A short greeting.

Austin and the squad members moved their feet towards the entrance of the HQ.

Roan just stood still for a long while and just looked at their backs.

‘They are good guys.’

Guys he wanted to be with until the end.

A smile appears on Roan’s mouth.

And then, a familiar voice was heard.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

“Huh?”

Roan turned his head and looked at the owner of the voice.

“Pierce. Why didn’t you leave?”

The owner of the voice was Pierce.

He laughed awkwardly and shook his head.

“My hometown is also far. I am just planning on resting at HQ.”

“Ah. You said that your hometown was in the middle regions, right?”

“Yes. I’m from Blei village from the Billington region.”

“It’s far.”

“Yes. It is.”

Roan and Pierce looked at each other and smiled bitterly.

Even after receiving vacations, they didn’t have anywhere to go.

Then, Pierce carefully asked after hesitating for a bit.

“Should we have some drinks?”

*****

It was a strange feeling.

Roan took one gulp on the warm beer.

‘Have I drank with Pierce before……….’

He searched his memories.

‘Ah! It was only once.’

After Pierce became a duke.

The day before he left to the feudal estate, he returned to the squad’s headquarters and looked for him.

‘He brought a really expensive wine.’

On that day, Pierce just shared the bottle of wine without saying anything and left.

Roan also didn’t say a word and just emptied the wine.

‘Was that our last encounter….’

But of course, they saw each other from far away.

However, the difference between the places they were standing was as big as the distance there was between them.

Pierce was on a high platform, and Roan was on the lowest place.

‘It must have been a sort of consideration.’

He purposefully distanced himself.

And he hadn’t even said that he was a duke, a supreme commander or a noble with his own mouth.

Perhaps that could have been some sort of consideration from Pierce.

When he was immersed on the old memories.

“Sir adjutant Roan?”

Pierce’s voice was heard.

“What are you thinking that much?”

“Ah, nothing. Only that the past months feel like it passed byas if they were crazy days.”

“It passed by without even knowing what happened and how.”

Pierce smiled faintly and lifted the cup of beer.

Gulp. Gulp.

He emptied the cup in an instant and looked at Roan fixedly.

“Sir adjutant.”

Roan just looked at his eyes instead of replying.

Pierce’s words continued.

“You know my character really well, right? That i’m shy and timid and don’t even have boldness. I don’t like standing in front of others and i’m sloppy regarding human relationships.”

Roan was about to unconsciously nod but stopped.

Pierce scratched the table with his finger.

Scratch. Scratch.

The scratching of the wood was heard.

“I have regretted a lot during the training times. Should I just return to my hometown and live off farming? I thought that a lot.”

Tak.

His finger stopped.

Pierce looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

A hot eyesight.

“But now, looking at sir adjutant, I felt a lot of things.”

Roan waited for the next words.

“Amazing tactics, outstanding strategies, amazing spear skills……. Of course I felt all of these things to be amazing, but there is another thing in which I felt even more amazed.”

He puts strength on his voice.

“Effort.”

Pierce took in a deep breath.

“Sir adjutant didn’t even miss one day of squad training, troop training, and individual training. And that’s not all.”

Fire appears on his eyes.

“You put effort on trying to understand the squad members and to comprehend them. You nursed Land all night because he hurt his shoulder, and you searched for a stomach ache medicine all around the troop because of Keep. And……..”

Pierce started to talk about the things Roan did for the soldiers of the 12th squad without anyone noticing.

Roan smiled faintly.

“I just did the things an adjutant has to do.”

At those words Pierce shook his head.

“No. There’s only you that goes to this lengths.”

A firm and determined voice and expression.

“Sir adjutant. You will really become an excellent commander. You will become a great general who will shake Rinse kingdom, no, the whole continent.”

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“If I become a great general, you will become the greatest spearman on the continent.”

“Me?”

“Right. If it’s your talent, you can do it plentily.”

Roan looked at Pierce’s eyes fixedly.

Eyes without even a trace of hesitation.

‘These eyes……..?’

Pierce felt that his heart beat roughly.

‘It’s the sight he gave me at Int’s forest battle.’

Back then Pierce was really afraid while facing the ogres.

And Roan just threw a short sentence for that Pierce.

I believe in you.

‘It’s the same eyes.’

Eyes that didn’t doubt that he would really be able to become the best spearman on the continent.

Pierce bit his lower lip.

He looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“If…….”

His voice trembles.

“If I get to become the best spearman on the continent, then use me as your adjutant.”

At those words Roan smirked and shook his head.

“I can’t do that?”

“Yes? You, you can’t?”

Pierce asked back with a perplexed expression.

Roan slowly nodded.

“Of course. I can’t use the best spearman on the continent as only an adjutant. At least, you will have to become a general.”

“Ah……”

Pierce let out a sigh of relief.

And then, looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“Don’t forget that promise.”

“Of course.”

Roan smirked and nodded.

And then, he thought of one thing.

‘If Pierce…….’

The corner of his mouth slightly rises.

“Pierce.”

“Yes?”

Pierce put down the cup he was holding.

Roan asked with a voice so low as if he was whispering.

“Should I teach you a spear skill?”

“A spear skill?”

“Yes. There’s one that really fits you.”

Pierce smiled brightly and nodded.

“Teach me!”

And then, asked with a careful voice.

“But what’s the name of it?”

At those words, Roan laughed a bit awkwardly and replied.

“Roan’s spearmanship.”

Roan’s spearmanship.

Actually, there was no way that existed.

‘Even so, I can’t say that it’s called Pierce’s spearmanship.’

Roan was planning on teaching Pierce Pierce’s spearmanship.

Originally, a spearmanship Pierce would make himself 8 years from now on.

‘If Pierce gets it 8 years earlier, what kind of monster like thing will be born…….’

It can become approach a perfected spearmanship.

‘If I get to raise a force………’

The new Pierce’s spearmanship, no, Roan’s spearmanship will be of great help.

Then, Pierce’s ill-tempered voice was heard.

“Yes? That’s a name that doesn’t make me want to learn it that much.”

Chapter 35




“Right. Then let’s leave it at that.”

Roan raised his cup of beer with a calm expression.

“Ah, no I just…….”

Pierce stammered with a perplexed expression.

“I know that you were joking.”

Roan smirked and shook his hands.

Only then did Pierce let out a sigh of relief.

“Whew. I got surprised.”

“I was also joking. I will teach you, so don’t worry.”

As soon as he finished those words, Pierce got up of his seat.

“Let’s go out.”

“Huh? To where?”

“You said that you were going to teach me. Roan’s spearmanship.”

At those words, Roan put on an absent-minded expression.

“You want me to teach you now? We are in the middle of drinking.”

And as soon as he said that, Pierce grabbed his cup of beer.

Gulp. Gulp.

His adam’s apple shook up and down.

“Burp. We can go now, right?”

Pierce burped and put down the cup of beer.

Roan looked at the emptied cup and smacked his lips.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

Pierce urged with an earnest expression.

Roan took in a deep breath and stood up.

“Okay. Let’s go. Go.”

However, his eyes kept looking at the cup of beer.

‘It was beer I drank in a long while……’

A feeling of only having wetted his lips.

Even so, as he saw the heated up Pierce, he felt a gratified expression.

‘Then. Shall I teach Pierce’s spearmanship to the genius spearman Pierce, no, Roan’s spearmanship?’

A smile appeared on his face.

Roan hit Pierce’s shoulder and left the bar one step ahead of him.

Pierce hurriedly chased his back.

The two people went outside Beno castle.

They had consumed alcohol so the soft spring wind made their tongues feel sweet.

As they got out of the northern gate and walked for a bit, they saw a wide plain.

‘This much will be good.’

A place better than anywhere to train on the spear.

Roan lightly warmed up and looked at the western sky.

He saw the bright sunset above the mountains.

‘Beautiful.’

Could leisure have appeared in his heart?

It was the first time he thought that the sunset was beautiful since he was born.

Then, Pierce’s voice was heard.

“Sir adjutant Roan. Let’s start immediately.”

An urging sound.

Roan smirked and nodded.

“Okay. Shall we……..”

The moment he was about to take off his sight from the sunset.

He saw an object running hurriedly on the western plains.

‘What is it?’

Roan concentrated his sight towards the really small and faint object that was far away.

At that instant, the scene got sucked in along his sight.

The object which he couldn’t see because it was faint now seemed so clear like it was right in front of him.

“Huh?”

Roan frowned.

He hurriedly raised his spear and yelled towards Pierce.

“Pierce. It seems like we will have to run.”

“Yes? What are you saying so suddenly?”

Pierce asked back with a dumbfounded expression.

Roan charged to the front instead of replying.

Tat!

“Someone is being chased.”

An urgent voice was heard from the place he left.

Pierce chased after Roan a bit late.

“Who are you talking about?”

At the question being asked in a loud voice, a reply came soon.

“A young man.”

*****

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

His breath rose to his chin.

However, he couldn’t stop his feet.

‘Kugh. Damn. Because I did something I usually didn’t, it seems like I will die alone.’

Chris gritted his teeth.

His right arm hurt.

‘Fortunately, it doesn’t seem deep……..’

Between the sloppily torn clothes, the wound could be seen.

Although it wasn’t that deep of an injury, blood still flowed out.

‘Why did I have to sneeze there, damn it.’

Chris looked at the black book he was holding with his left arm.

It was the size of a palm and had a thickness of two fingers.

Account book.

‘Crazy bastards. To even make an account book while selling people.’

Chris slightly glanced back.

Dudududu

Two people who looked dangerous were riding their horses like crazy.

‘Damn. It seems like I’ll get caught.’

Even if he was fast, he couldn’t be as fast as horses.

Chris first chose to run towards the woods in the northeast.

It was a decision to lower the speed of the horses by even a little.

‘I should just have earned money in Miller.’

Regret came late.

It was a problem of having stepped out because a daughter of a countryside couple had gotten kidnapped.

‘Although it would be meaningless to regret it now.’

The choice was made by him anyways.

It was the right thing to do to blame it on him on whatever results happened.

It was the right thing to do, he would be blamed for whatever happened as a result.

‘Good! It’s the woods now!’

It was when he was about to get in.

A heavy sound was heard.

Papapapapang

Chris didn’t look back.

He thought that he could guess the identity of the object.

‘Bola!’

A throwing weapon that was a rope with two weights at the end.

Rather than damaging the opponent, it was a weapon used to catch the body or the legs and make them unable to move.

Chris gritted his teeth and moved to his right.

Tung!

The Bola fell right next to him.

‘Good! I dodg…….!’

When he was busy celebrating….

Papapapapang

The Bola certainly had fallen to the ground but he could still hear a noise.

‘Damn. There’s one more!’

He tried to dodge it, but he was too late and he felt a heavy shock below his knees.

The Bola circled the leg and wrapped it.

Boom!

Chris fell to the ground and rolled.

“Ughh.”

It was a pain similar to his bones breaking.

But even so Chris quickly raised his body.

‘I have to untie this.’

The Bola that tied his legs tightly.

His hands urgently tried to untie the rope.

And then a black shadow covered him.

“We finally caught you.”

A cold voice.

Chris gulped dry saliva and raised his head.

At that moment he saw a huge foot.

Pagak!

“Kugh.”

Chris rolled quite a few times with only one kick.

‘Damn. My handsome face will get messed up.’

A useless thought.

Then a vicious conversation was heard.

“And the account book?”

A question asked by a man with a pointy chin and thin eyes.

The man with a twisted nose pointed at Chris.

“Fortunately that bastard has it.”

“Really? Then take it away from him and kill him quickly.”

“Okay.”

The man with the twisted nose grabbed Chris’s shoulders with a casual expression.

‘I can’t die like this.’

Chris bit his lower lip and threw away the account book he had in his hand with all of his strength.

The account book showed the white pages and disappeared in the grass.

“This crazy bastard!”

The man with the twisted nose cursed and hurriedly ran towards the account book.

Then, Chris stood up from the place abruptly.

His legs, which were previously tied with the Bola, were cleanly untied.

‘I thought that I was going to die for untying it without them noticing.’

Then, he quickly flung his body to a side.

However, he couldn’t make more than three steps.

Pagak!

The hard and sharp tip of the foot hit his side.

“Kugh!”

He felt the wind get knocked out of his lungs.

Chris grabbed his side and fell.

“Son of a bitch. You throw it without even knowing how much it’s worth. Twet!”

The thin eyed man spat and got annoyed.

Meanwhile, the man with the twisted nose hurriedly ran and grabbed the account book that was on the ground.

“Steve! The account book is fine!”

A loud yell.

“Then come quickly and cut off the neck of this bastard.”

The man with thin eyes, Steve, talked back annoyedly and got on his horse.

Srung

The man with the twisted nose approached slowly and unsheathed his sword.

“You dare to put your hands on an object of our JoyLuce. First I will cut off that bad-mannered hand of yours.”

Even Chris realized that the situation had turned out to be quite difficult.

‘Damn. I couldn’t even fulfill my dream of running a travel agency and will die like this.’

He felt that it was kind of unfair.

He was only a teen that was on his 22nd year.

It was too early for him to die like this.

The man with the twisted nose raised his right hand into the air.

The sharp blade of the sword shone brightly.

‘If I knew this was going to happen I would have eaten a lot of meat last night……’

When he was thinking about that.

Sweeeee!

A sharp noise hit their ears.

Everybody’s sight moved to the place the noise was heard.

A sharp object came flying over while cutting through the air.

That was certainly a spear.

The spear precisely separated Chris and Steve.

Puk!

A heavy noise.

The spear that got stuck deep in the earth trembled.

“Huk! Wha, what is it!”

The man with the twisted nose was surprised and looked towards the direction the spear came flying from.

Pshhh

Then, the grass started to move roughly and was separated by the sides.

“Stop right there. Nobody move.”

A childish voice but with strength.

The person that came out of the grass was Roan.

Following him, Pierce appeared.

He was looking a bit nervous.

Contrary to him, Roan had a really calm expression and moved to pull out the spear stuck in the ground.

The tip of the spear was pointed at Steve.

“I’m adjutant Roan of Rrose troop from the 7th corps. Reveal your identities.”

At that moment, Steve’s hand was frozen stiff.

‘Damn. To meet people from the kingdom here.’

His eyes rolled to the sides quickly.

Then, Chris’s voice was heard.

“Those bastards are slave merchants!”

Right after he finished saying that.

“Fuck! Norman! Run!”

Steve yelled and grabbed the reins.

Hihihihing!

The horse cried loudly and raised its front legs.

‘Die!’

Steve was planning to stamp down Roan.

However, Roan had already read Steve’s intentions.

Roan twisted his body and took three steps to the right.

He saw the rough movements of the horse slowly and clearly.

‘He’s full of weak points.’

There were tens of places where he could stab the spear.

‘But my movements don’t follow me.’

He tasted bitterness in his mouth.

However Pierce, that couldn’t know of this at all, judged that Roan was in an urgent situation.

He quickly stabbed out the spear.

Stab

The spear pierced the body of the horse deeply.

Hihihihing!

The horse moved its body here and there with rough movements.

“Huh?!”

“Uhhhhhh.”

It was obvious for Steve, but even Pierce couldn’t move properly because he was perplexed.

However Roan could see all of these things slowly and clearly.

Spat!

Roan’s spear slashed through the air.

Paat!

The spear passed next to Steve’s neck.

‘It missed!’

Steve was happy and once again tried to pull the reins.

And then, the spear that was behind him was pulled and hit the back of his head.

“Ugh!”

Amazing strength.

His chest got stuck to the horse.

“Hmph.”

Roan snorted and after twisting his wrist, he pulled the spear.

Pat!

At that moment Steve, that was balancing sloppily, fell down from the horse.

“Kugh.”

A heavy shock felt coursed through his back and waist.

Steve frowned and twisted his body.

Roan quickly raised his spear upside down and smashed it into the stomach of the man.

Puk!

“Kugh!”

A pain that cuts his breath.

Steve lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

Dudududu

Then, he heard noisy horse steps.

It was Norman.

He quickly got out of the forest while Steve was making that fuss.

Although Roan tried to chase him, there was a big difference between their speeds.

The horse Steve was riding couldn’t move anymore because of Pierce’s attack.

Meanwhile, Norman disappeared far away.

‘Can’t do anything.’

He decided to be satisfied on having saved the life of this person.

“Are you okay?”

At Roan’s question, Chris nodded.

“Yes. I’m fine. Thank you for having saved me.”

It seemed unshapely, but he was gentle and respectful.

Roan looked at Chris’s face.

‘I think I have seen him somewhere…….’

He was about to remember but couldn’t.

Then, Chris touched his face and tilted his head.

“Is there something on my face?”

Roan laughed awkwardly and said.

“No. You just seem familiar. Did we meet somewhere else before?”

At those words, Chris shook his head.

“No. Not in my memories. I’m not from over here but from the capital of Miller. I ran errands over there.”

“Ah…..”

At that moment, a low exclamation flowed out from Roan’s mouth.

Errand runner Chris, from the capital of Miller.

There was only one person in his past life that had this characteristics.

‘Chris. Chris Drain!’

He startled awake.

Roan looked at Chris with composed eyes.

‘To meet Chris here……’

Chris.

As it was before he got a title of nobility, he still didn’t have the last name of Drain.

‘The one in charge of Ian Philip’s information agency.’

The man that would grasp every piece of information regarding Rinse kingdom 10 years from now on and of course on the continent was standing in front of him.

‘It wasn’t enough with meeting Ian Phillips, but I even met Chris.’

These were all things that didn’t happen in his past life.

‘On top of that, Chris said that he hadn’t left the capital of Miller until he met Ian Phillips.’

That Chris was at the eastern part of the kingdom, and on top of that appeared near the border.

Roan asked with a careful voice.

“What are you doing all the way here when you are from Miller?”

At those words Chris bit his lower lip.

“This is all because of the slave merchants. There is this group called JoyLuce.”

“JoyLuce group?”

Roan was surprised once more.

‘If it’s the JoyLuce group……..’

A really familiar name.

‘The slave merchants we captured while we were moving to Pedian’s plain were certainly called JoyLuce.’

‘Did the future change because I captured the guys of JoyLuce?’

Chapter 36





He didn’t get badly surprised.

‘Even at Int’s forest battle and Prely river’s inundation tactic, the future changed to what I knew.’

But even so, there was a clear difference now.

‘It’s an opportunity to know how much the future I knew has changed.’

How would the chasing of JoyLuce’s group have affected Chris’s life?

He had a strong curiosity.

Then, Chris’s voice was heard.

“According to the information I gathered, JoyLuce’s group got caught by the kingdoms men.”

Roan slowly nodded.

It was himself who had caught them.

Chris continued talking.

“But there were guys that were acting separately. Because of that, they could be safe. However they couldn’t stay at Rinse kingdom anymore because they were wanted by the kingdom.”

“Ah….”

Roan and Pierce let out low exclamations.

This was the first time they got to know that JoyLuce’s group had gotten a bounty.

“In the end, they planned to secretly cross the borders and go to Istel kingdom. But as the main group got caught, they lost a lot of money. And to gain money to escape……”

“They would have started to capture slaves again.”

At Roan’s words, Chris nodded.

“Yes. That’s right. They kidnapped young women or children from countryside villages and sold them at a reasonable price.”

“Trash like bastards.”

Pierce mumbled in a low voice.

Roan also nodded while keeping his mouth shut.

There was displeasement and rage in his eyes.

However, the sins of those guys wasn’t only that.

“That’s not all. They killed people that disturbed them in their work or mutilated their legs and arms and kept them in barns. There were also cases where there were a lot of crazy perverted bastards and personally raped young girls and also made families kill each other.”

“Mmm.”

Roan and Pierce got a loss for words.

The sins of those guys were beyond their imaginations.

Chris let out a sigh.

“Hearing that the daughter of a countryside old couple got kidnapped, I started to chase them.”

The reason why Chris, who originally had to be at Hiller kingdom running errands until he met Ian, appeared on the borders of Rinse kingdom.

That was to find the daughter of the old couple.

Chris’s expression became dark.

“The results of my investigation state that the daughter was sold somewhere. The moment I was about to give up I found out that they had a sales record.”

“So the thing that crooked nose grabbed and escaped with was the account book.”

As Roan spoke, Chris nodded.

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘As I caught the main group of JoyLuce, the other slave merchants that were separated started to kidnap young girls and kids to get money to escape. In that process, Chris started to look for a daughter of an old couple that got kidnapped in Miller kingdom. When he coincidentally heard of the situation, he started to chase the slave merchants until the kingdom’s boundaries.’

The future he knew clearly changed.

‘Amazing.’

With only a little case, it was followed by completely different results.

‘Even so, it isn’t that the experience, intelligence and information I gathered for 20 years will disappear. Most of all…….’

A chill appears on his eyes.

Roan looked at Chris.

“How many are they?”

“Twelve.”

Chris raised two fingers.

Roan asked in a careful voice.

“Are you able to move?”

Chris touched his chin and sides and nodded.

“Yes, there’s no problem on moving.”

At those words, Roan looked to where Norman fled.

“Then, let’s chase them.”

At that moment, his eyes became round wide.

Unexpected words.

“Are, are you helping me?”

Surprise could be felt in his words.

Roan nodded.

“I can’t just let those trash like bastards cross the boundary. Let’s catch them and take the account book.”

“Wouldn’t it be better to let this be known to the headquarters and ask for help?”

Chris asked with a worried expression.

Even excluding Steve, they were 11.

And compared to them, they were only 3.

“If we go there, we will be late.”

Roan shook his head.

One guy had fled.

If this news became known, the slave merchants would try to cross the boundary.

‘If they cross the boundary, there’s nothing I can do.’

He had to chase them right now.

Chris still had an uneasy expression.

“Won’t it be dangerous?”

At those words, Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.

“It’s not important if it’s dangerous or not.”

A calm voice but with strength.

“The important thing is to catch them to search for the sold villagers.”

“Ah……..”

Chris lets a low exclamation.

‘He wasn’t going for the reward?’

Actually, he thought that Roan was trying to do the impossible because of the reward.

But Roan didn’t think about money, but about the villagers.

“Let’s return the kidnapped villagers to their homes.”

He thought that it was something a kingdom’s man had to do.

Chris received a big shock.

‘Was there a kingdom’s man like this?’

Was there someone that wasn’t a normal soldier and was above the rank of adjutant that thought like this?

There wasn’t.

At least, he had never seen one like that.

‘They are all selfish bastards that worry about filling their bellies.’

The old country couple that complained to look for her daughter.

The reason why they left their hometown and came all the way to Miller capital was because the kingdom’s men of the region all acted as if it wasn’t their business.

‘But Miller kingdom was also the same.’

In the end he, who was only an errand runner, chased after the slave merchants.

The kingdom’s men were that kind of existence.

They didn’t show that big of an interest towards normal villagers.

At least, the ones he had met until now were like that.

However, Roan that was in front of his eyes, was different.

‘It’s somewhat weird.’

A feeling of his heart getting numb.

Not a bad feeling.

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“But for that……”

Roan looked at Chris’s eyes fixedly.

“I need your help. Will you able to chase after them?”

As soon as he finished his sentence, Chris smiled brightly and replied.

“Of course. I’m confident on being able to chase them. It’s already been 15 days that I’ve been ontheir tails.”

He spoke with a confident voice and expression.

‘I want to help. I want to help as much as I can.’

He liked Roan.

Roan gripped his spear and looked at Pierce.

“Pierce. There are 11 slave merchants. You are confident, right?”

At those words, Pierce smiled faintly and asked back.

“Do you mean with my eyes closed?”

He bragged regardless like usual.

That meant that he was that confident.

Roan and Pierce tied down Steve on a tree for now.

He had completely lost consciousness and wouldn’t get up for a while.

“Then, shall we go?”

At Roan’s words, Chris nodded and started to run at the front.

His chin and sides hurt, but it was endurable.

Pababababt.

The three people that left the forest started to run on the plains while cutting through the air.

Above them, the bright sunset shone on them.

A bright scene and the sweet spring wind.

A beautiful scenery could be seen.

Roan, Pierce and Chris drew a long line on that scenery and ran without stopping.

Their relationship started like this.

*****

“Sir commander, we have arrived.”

Mendel lent a long cylinder.

Aaron put aside the documents he was reviewing without ahold of himself and received the cylinder.

Click.

As he twisted the cylinder, the top part of it separated along with a noise.

Aaron put his index finger on the cylinder and took out the rolled piece of paper.

As he spread the rolled paper, he saw the words written on it.

Aaron kept checking the piece of paper that only had three paragraphs.

“Mmm.”

A satisfied expression.

He returned the paper back to Mendel.

This time, Mendel was the one to read the contents of the paper.

“It wasn’t a lie.”

Mendel smacked his lips and put back the piece of paper.

At those words, Aaron nodded.

“It’s true that he’s from Grain’s mountainside, and it’s also true that he comes from Peton’s training camp. And the relationship he has with his family is all true. It’s been revealed that everything he has told us is true.”

The corner of his mouth kept rising up and down.

It meant that he felt happy.

Mendel asked with a dissatisfaction face.

“Even so, he’s only a rank 5 adjutant. I think that there’s no need to ask a request to the information guild.”

“I wonder. He’s only a class 5 adjutant now…..”

Aaron paused for a moment and touched his lips with his fingers.

A weird light shone on his eyes.

“That guy’s talent won’t end there.”

He looked at Mende’s two eyes fixedly.

“Roan certainly has talent to become someone big.”

At those words, Mendel shook his head.

“Just because he has talent doesn’t mean that he will succeed. Don’t you also know that well?”

“True. You also need many things aside of talent.”

Aaron slowly nodded.

His corner of the mouth rose up.

A strange smile.

“That’s why i’m going to fill everything excluding talent.”

Quite an exceptional declaration.

Mendel frowned, having forgotten that Aaron was a commander of an army corps and a noble.

“Just what is the reason you are doing that?”

It was quite a provocative way of speaking, but Aaron didn’t show particular reactions.

He leaned back on the chair and replied shortly.

“I don’t want to end my life with only being a commander of the 7th corps and a baron.”

An extravagant reply.

But Mendel didn’t ask anymore.

It was because laughter disappeared from Aaron’s face.

He covered his face with his two hands.

‘Anyways, there won’t be a problem unless he is a spy.’

Countless plans appeared and crumbled in his head repeatedly.

‘What I need for now……’

The tip of Aaron’s finger trembled.

One of the countless plans was resting on the tip of his finger.

******

‘He is a genius in a completely different meaning.’

Roan looked at Chris moving ahead of him and was astounded.

He knew that 10 years from now on, Chris would get ahold of all the information on the continent as the person responsible for the agency.

But that was 10 years from now on.

Most of all, he learned to genuinely gather information after having met Ian.

‘Now, it would be before even having learnt pursuing skills……..’

Right now, Chris was no different to an errand runner of Miller kingdom.

“It’s this way.”

But regardless of that, he knew how to instinctively hunt.

No, he was learning bit by bit.

Faint footsteps, the places where the grass was stepped on, the direction the branch got twisted, and a sense you couldn’t even express with words.

Chris chased the slave merchants with much information and used his senses as his guide..

Thanks to that, they could catch up to them even before the sun completely set.

“Fuck. To meet the kingdom’s men in a place like this.”

“So Steve got caught by them?”

“Yeah. I was watching until he got hit by the spear and lost consciousness.”

A really dispirited voice.

It was Norman.

“Damn. He acted intelligent all alone.”

“Stupid bastard. I knew it since he always acted great.”

The guys surrounding Norman made cynical remarks.

They didn’t think that Roan, Pierce and Chris would chase them.

No, they thought that even if they wanted to, they wouldn’t be able to.

They moved that fast and tried to leave the least amount of traces.

“Even so, we got the account book back. After the sun sets and it gets dark we will cross the boundary.”

“Okay.”

“Finally, our life of escaping is coming to an end!”

A bit excited voices.

“Whew. Even so, now that we have some leisure, I’m yearning for some alcohol.”

“Alcohol? Kukuku. Women for me.”

“Women? Women are good. Now that I see it, the girl in that country side village really killed it.”

“Is it only one or two, the villages we have swept? Kukuku.”

“I still remember that 10 year old kid. Kugh!”

Evil deeds come flowing out of their mouths.

‘Trash like bastards.’

Roan, Pierce and Chris looked at the slave merchants and bit their lips.

“Mister Chris, you should wait over here.”

“I, I can also help.”

At Roan’s words, Chris replied back with a low voice but with strength.

Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.

“If your role was up to here, from now on we will have to take care of it. Give an opportunity to us too.”

“Leave it to us.”

Pierce stood in front.

The blade of the spear, that was pointing at the ground, shone.

In the end, Chris slowly nodded and fell back.

Roan smiled faintly and made a signal towards Pierce.

The signals they had repeated without stop and had memorized.

Tat!

Roan and Pierce lowered their posture and flung their bodies towards the grass.

Quick movements like a flying tiger.

Worry appeared on the face of Chris, that was checking on them.

‘Will they really be able to face 11 people? They seem really young even at first glance.’

However you thought of it, 2 vs 11 was a really disadvantageous fight.

On top of that, Roan and Pierce looked younger than him.

However it didn’t take long until Chris’s worries disappeared.

******

‘What is it?’

‘What is this greenhorn?’

The slave merchants that were waiting for the sun to set glared at Roan and Pierce, who that appeared suddenly from the grass, and frowned.

“Uoh? Huh?”

Only Norman’s face, that remembered Roan’s and Pierce’s face, turned pale and stammered.

The slave merchants were looking at that Norman in a weird way.

“Trash like bastards.”

Roan’s voice, that was cold and low, rang with strength.

At that moment, the faces of the slave merchants contorted.

“Is this bastard crazy!”

“Just from where did this crazy bastard appear from?”

Then, the light of the sunset shined on Roan’s and Pierce’s armor.

Only then could their armor, troop badge and rank be seen clearly.

“Huh?!”

“What!”

“Wha, the kingdom’s men?”

Only then did the slave merchants flinch and fall back.

Roan pointed at them with the point of his spear.

“I’m class 5 adjutant Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps.”

He looked at the eyes of the slave merchants fixedly.

A cold light.

Continued by that, the even colder west wind blew.

“If you don’t want to die, simply surrender.”

A chilly smile appears on his face.

“But personally……”

His spear did the talking.

“I would like it if you opposed us fiercely.”

Chapter 37




The slave merchants started to fall back.

However, because of the huge rocks that were behind them, they didn’t have anywhere else to move.

‘Damn. As he picked a place that was good to hide ourselves…….’

They fell in their own trap.

They bit their lower lips and exchanged glances.

‘If we can’t escape, then we can only fight.’

‘They are 2, and we are 11.’

‘On top of that, they are real greenhorns!’

The class 5 adjutant badge bothered them, but objectively thinking, it wasn’t a situation where they should be afraid.

They brought their hands to their waists as if they had all agreed to it beforehand.

Srung.

A well polished blade appeared along the noise of unsheathing.

The slave merchants started to walk towards Roan and Pierce.

But only one, Norman, was still standing on his place not knowing what to do.

‘Tha…. that guy isn’t simply a greenhorn soldier.’

He brought up the memories of Steve getting done by helplessly.

‘His spear skills aren’t normal.’

His eyes trembled.

Looking at that Norman, the slave merchants clicked their tongues.

“That dumbass. He’s such a scaredy cat.”

“For that bastard to be working as a slave merchant. Tch tch tch.”

They looked at Roan and Pierce and cursed him.

“Look greenhorn. What? You said that we were pieces of trash?”

“It seems that you are out of your minds. You are two and we are eleven.”

Bloodthirst could be sensed on their voices.

Roan smiled faintly and grabbed his spear.

“How fortunate.”

At those words, the slave merchants frowned.

“What? What is fortunate?”

Roan just charged to the front instead of replying.

Pat!

A sharp sound.

The spear separated the wind.

“Hup!”

The slave merchants gulped in some air at the sudden attack.

They tried to quickly dodge it, but the spear was much faster.

Stab.

The spear stabbed the neck just like that.

A fast attack without even a hint of hesitation.

“For opposing me roughly just like I wanted.”

Bang.

The slave merchant that had his neck pierced fell down.

“Thi, this damned!”

“This son of a bitch!”

The other slave merchants charged in late while cursing.

The sharp blades came in by the sides.

Roan twisted his arms so it got crossed, and after grabbing his spear he turned his body.

Pruuuuu!

As he twisted his crossed wrists, the spear started to spin quickly.

Roan lowered his head at the incoming blades and spinned the spear to the back side of his head.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The blade of the slave merchants got hit by the spear and bounced back.

“Kugh!”

“Damn.”

Curses spewing out instinctively.

But even so, they weren’t on a situation where they could curse freely.

Pat!

It was because Pierce stabbed his spear to the sides of the bastards.

Stab.

“Kugh!”

Another one fell nully.

“Son of bitches!”

The other slave merchants swung their blades while gritting their teeth.

‘I have to get closer. If I do, I will have a chance.’

The spear was a long distance weapon.

If they got really close to them, they wouldn’t be able to do much.

“Uaaaaaaa!”

“Die!”

The bastards yelled and jumped in closer to Roan and Pierce.

“Hmph!”

At that sight, Roan and Pierce snorted and pulled their spears.

Spat!

The spear slipped smoothly while running through the palm.

Roan and Pierce gripped the spear shortly and rose it close to their chests.

At the same time, they put the spear on their armpits.

Thanks to that, the end part of the spear that should keep shaking because of the weight balance, received a lot of strength.

Cheng! Checheng!

Roan and Pierce swung the spear on their armpits and the blades of the slave merchants off got bounced off.

“Im, impossible!”

“Damn it!”

Expressions they couldn’t believe and perplexed voices.

In the first place, they weren’t even opponents for Roan and Pierce.

Then, Roan and Pierce exchanged glances and slightly nodded.

At the same time the spun their body to opposite sides.

Spat!

The long spear that was at the back part cut through the air and hit the sides of the slave merchants.

Puk!

“Kugh!”

“Kugh!”

They got done by helplessly at the sudden attacks.

At the pain they felt of cutting their breathing, they held their sides.

Roan and Pierce didn’t miss this opportunity.

The sharp spear cut through the space and danced.

Stab.

The spear pierced through the necks of the merchants.

In an instant, 8 died and only 2 remained.

Even counting Norman that was far away, they were only 3.

Pierce’s spear drew an arc and moved softly.

Then, the two slave merchants threw their blades away and kneeled down.

“Uhhhhh. We, we surrender! Surrender!”

“We will give ourselves!”

Their shoulders that trembled pitifully while even lowering their heads.

Tuk.

Pierce changed the trajectory of the spear and put it up behind him.

A soft and perfect finishing touch.

“Trash like bastards. You will pay for your sins.”

A cold voice.

“Yes. Yes. We will receive whatever punishment.”

“We are indeed trash. We are trash.”

The slave merchants lowered their heads.

A pitiful look whoever saw it.

But on the lowered heads, there was a chilly and nasty smile.

‘Son of a bitch. I can’t end it like this.’

His hand that was gripping the earth, slowly moved towards his talon.

He grabbed the blade with the tip of his fingers.

Pierce smiled towards Roan brightly even without knowing of this situation.

“Sir adjutant Roan. I’m finishe…..”

When he talked up to that point.

“Die!”

The guys that were on the ground grabbed their blades and stood up.

Even if it was Pierce, that had outstanding talent, it was a difficult situation.

Then, a sharp noise hit their ears.

Sweeee!

Puk!

The thing that cut the air and smashed the head of them was Roan’s spear.

“Hup.”

Pierce gulped in some air.

The blade of the bastards were already touching his side.

If it wasn’t for Roan, it would have gotten sliced off.

‘It was dangerous.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

Thanks to Kalian’s tear, he could see the movements of the slave merchants slowly and clearly.

He had thrown his spear even before the blade got unsheathed.

‘If it wasn’t for Kalian’s tear, i would have lost Pierce.’

Roan let out a sigh of relief and moved and grabbed his spear.

As he put strength on his wrist, the spear that had pierced the heads got pulled out.

“Pierce.”

“Yes? Yes. Sir adjutant.”

Pierce lowered his head with a half absent minded expression.

Roan hit his shoulder and smiled faintly.

“You can’t show your back thoughtlessly on a battlefield. And can’t even trust your enemies easily. Understood?”

“Yes, yes. I understand.”

Pierce got ahold of himself late and nodded.

He was the best spearman in history but right now he was no different to a greenhorn soldier.

He still lacked real experience.

‘If he keeps roaming the battlefield, it will be something he solves by his own.’

There was no way to feel that bothered by it.

Roan swung his spear and turned his head.

Now, only Roan remained.

“Huh?”

The eyes of Roan and Pierce got big.

It’s because an unexpected scene had occurred.

“I, I really surrender. In the first place, I was planning to give myself in.”

Norman pleaded while being on the floor.

The surprising thing was his look.

The weird thing right now was that he wasn’t putting on any clothes.

“I don’t have any blades or weapons on me. Look.”

Norman raised his two hands.

The reason why he suddenly undressed.

It was because he was scared if they would get suspicious for nothing because of the action of the others.

Roan smiled bitterly and shook his head.

‘Even so, I was planning on letting one live.’

There may be other slave merchants.

‘If I inquiry this one and the guy we tied and left on the forest, it will be enough.’

Especially on Norman’s case, they felt that he will be really useful as he was a scaredy cat.

Then, they saw Chris that was hiding on the grass.

“Ah…….”

He looked at the corpses of the slave merchants and let out a low exclamation.

‘They really got rid of 11 people just by themselves?’

He viewed Roan and Pierce as amazing.

‘Well, he would have climbed to be an adjutant at this young age because he has the skills.’

Chris sight remained on Roan.

‘A right nature and outstanding skills. He will certainly become someone big.’

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“Shall we look for the account book for now?”

“Ah, yes.”

Chris got a hold of himself late and moved his feet.

Then, Norman that was kneeling down while being undressed, looked on his clothes and took out a black account book.

“It, it’s here.”

He lent it down with his two hands while not being able to raise his head.

Chris received the account book and checked the contents of it thoroughly.

A surprised look could be seen on Roan’s face.

“Do you know how to read?”

At those words, Chris laughed awkwardly and shook his head.

“A little bit. There are more words I don’t know about.”

Roan still had a surprised expression.

‘A normal person at this age knows how to read?’

It wasn’t an easy thing.

And because of that, Aaron and the staff of the 7th corps got surprised big way.

Roan asked carefully.

“If it doesn’t bother you, may I ask you how you learned to read?”

At those words, Chris replied as if it didn’t bother him.

“I bought books while I made money and read it. At first, I didn’t know anything but as I kept on reading, I could see some letters. Well, I also asked to people I had some relation and learned that way.”

“Incredible. The cost of the books wouldn’t have been low.”

“Yes. Because of that, my dream of running a travel agency is getting pushed back.”

Chris let out a low sigh and shook his head.

Then, his finger that was checking on the contents of the books, stopped.

“I found it.”

A smile appeared on his face.

He had discovered the name of the daughter of the countryside couple on the corner of the book.

“She got sold to a millionaire on the region.”

Roan checked on the contents and nodded.

“It’s the region of Dellon.”

At that instant, Chris put a surprised expression.

“Huh? Sir adjutant also knows how to read?”

“Yes. I also learnt by asking people I had some relation with.”

“Ah……”

Chris let out a low exclamation again.

‘He looks even younger than me, but he also knows how to read.’

Then, Roan smiled faintly and pointed at the account book.

“May I take this account book with me?”

“Yes? Why this…..”

“It’s because of the people that got caught and sold off by the slave merchants. I have to return them to their homes, to where they originally were.”

“Ah……”

Chris shook his head and gave him the account book.

Anyways, he couldn’t rescue everyone by himself.

‘I can’t trust on the kingdoms men but I can trust this person.’

Chris looked at Roan with eyes filled trust.

Roan looked at the contents of the book for a moment and shrugged his shoulder.

“Then, shall we return to our headquarters?”

Soon, the sunset had disappeared and darkness fell on the plains.

However even on that darkness Roan’s Pierce’s and Chris’s eyes shone brightly.

*****

First, Roan put Norman and Steve on the prison of the headquarters and went with Gale.

Gale listened to the story about JoyLuce’s group and went to the corps headquarters with the account book.

And of course, he didn’t forget to congratulate Pierce and Chris before that.

Roan and Pierce brought Chris to the infirmary and after healing his injuries they slept for a night.

As the day brightened, the three people ate a simple breakfast and went towards the entrance of Beno castle.

“Yesterday, and today I received a really big help. I will never forget this grace and remember it.”

Chris bent his head towards Roan and Pierce.

“Then, I will be going.”

A farewell.

Then, Roan took out a pouch that seemed rather heavy from his chest.

“Take it.”

“What’s this?”

Chris didn’t receive it and asked carefully.

Roan smiled faintly and replied.

“It’s the reward.”

“Ah…….”

There was a not low wanted reward on JoyLuce’s slave merchants.

Chris shook his head.

“It was you who caught them.”

“If it wasn’t for you, it would have been impossible.”

Roan forcefully gave him the pocket.

“Thanks to you we were able to save the innocent people. It’s true that it was thanks to you.”

“Ah…..”

Chris hesitated for a moment and lowered his head.

“It wasn’t enough with having saved my life, but you also give me the reward. I’m really thankful.”

A trembling voice.

He truly felt thankful towards Roan and Pierce.

‘Later on, if there’s something I can help with, I will do it.’

If he received some grace, he would certainly pay it back.

That was Chris’s temperament.

“Then, where are you going now?”

As Roan asked, Chris replied while smiling brightly.

“First, I’m planning on looking for the countryside couple.”

It was decided the daughter of the old couple was going to be rescued by rose troop.

Because of that, Chris could lift a weight from his heart.

“And I will have to return to Miller kingdom.”

He looked at the reward pocket.

‘The reward was 200 pres.’

The salary of a normal person for a year was about exactly 200 pres.

It was more amazing than you could think.

‘If it’s this…….’

It was enough to run a small travelling agency.

“With that much, you will be able to run a small travelling agency.”

At Roan’s words, Chris smiled shyly and nodded.

Roan and Chris had conversed plentifully last night.

‘He did say that his dream was to run a travel agency. But……..’

He bit his lower lip.

Roan knew what talent Chris had and on what field.

If it came to this I want to awaken his talent early.

‘And if I can work with him, all the way better.’

He looked at Chris’s eyes fixedly.

“Mister Chris. Can I give you a proposal?”

“Of course. If it’s a proposal of sir adjutant Roan, it’s always welcomed.”

At those words, Roan said in a voice so low it seemed that he was whispering.

“I realized an important truth while working as an adjutant for the kingdom.”

A moment’s silence.

Chris also gulped dry saliva unconsciously.

Roan smiled brightly and continued saying.

“And that’s the strength information has.”

Chapter 38




“In……Information?”

Chris had a perplexed expression.

‘Why information so suddenly?’

It was something he hadn’t expected at all.

Roan didn’t mind and continued saying.

“The strength information has is amazing.”

He explained in detail just what role information took in in Int’s forest battle, and Prely’s inundation tactic.

“Ah……”

Chris let out a low exclamation and nodded.

‘If he didn’t know that there was a reservoir the army would have been annihilated.’

Certainly, the strength information had was amazing.

But just what was it related to him?

Chris looked at Roan with perplexed eyes,.

“I know fully well as to how amazing information can be. But the reason you are telling this to me……..?”

Roan smiled faintly and pointed to Chris.

“I would like it if mister Chris ran an information agency.”

“Yes?!”

Boom.

Chris felt that he had taken a blow from behind.

“In, information agency?”

Really unexpected words.

“If it’s handling information you already have the information guild or thieves guilds.”

At those words, Roan shook his head.

“I’m not talking about those small scale ones.”

The information guild and thieves guild only gathered information that could make money.

And as they only gathered those types of information, it was really limited.

On top of that, as they handled things per requests, things were really passive.

Chris laughed awkwardly and shook his head.

“I have never worked with information and haven’t even thought of it.”

On the other side Roan had a confident expression.

“Yesterday and today looking at mister Chris, I thought that you had great talent in acquiring information. If my guess is right, you will really be able to run an excellent information agency.”

“No, I…..”

Chris couldn’t talk easily.

He still felt dumbfounded.

“Just because it is an information agency, there’s nothing special about it. You said you will open a travel agency, right? It rather turned out well. If it’s an agency you will of course be able to travel around our Rinse kingdom, and also to kingdoms from other continents. It’s the best job for gathering information.”

“You are telling me to gather information while I run the travel agency?”

“Yes. A plain one at the eyes of others.”

Roan’s words continued.

“You analyze and organize the gathered information and sell it to the ones that need it. If it’s really important information, you cost of it will also be enormous.”

“Mmm.”

Chris fell in his thoughts for a moment.

But after a while, he smiled awkwardly and shook his head.

“I think that it will be impossible to decide on it immediately. Because it’s a field I have never thought until now.”

Roan slowly nodded.

“Think plentily and decide then.”

A calm expression.

But inwardly he felt full of regret.

‘Is it still not the time.’

If it turned out well, he wanted to appoint Chris as the responsible for his information.

The effectivity of Chris and his information agency was that excellent.

‘10 years from now on. If it’s early in 5 years. In that time the information era will start.’

An era where kingdoms of all continents are swept by calls.

An era where small and big kingdoms got scrambled and swept up.

‘Most of all, a lot of people will die.’

Rivers will be created with blood and corpses will create mountains.

‘If Chris bloomed his skills a bit earlier and ran an information agency it would be of great help.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘I will stop the battles I can, and save the ones I can.’

Even if he couldn’t stop the era itself, he wanted to save the most lives he could.

‘Actually it will be good to become that kind of monarch.’

A monarch that doesn’t eat and live well by his own, but one that makes everyone live and eat well.

The monarch Roan was dreaming of was that kind of monarch.

‘Then, I can’t fall back like this.’

You couldn’t know how relationships would turn out.

He didn’t want to give up here.

“Whatever choice you make, I respect your thoughts.”

“Thank you.”

Chris smiled faintly and nodded.

Then, Roan took out a rather heavy pouch from his chest.

“Take it.”

“What is this?”

Chris tilted his head.

“It’s investments.”

Investments?”

“Yes. I want to invest on you mister Chris.”

“Hup.”

Chris gulped in air.

An unexpected thing again.

Roan’s words continued.

“It’s a simple investment that has nothing to do with you running the information agency or not. I have eyes that can see through people. You will certainly succeed in a big way.”

“Ah, no anyways……”

Chris was still in a perplexed state.

Roan didn’t mind and brought his hand to his chest again.

“And……”

The thing that came out was Ian’s handkerchief.

He smiled faintly and lent him the handkerchief.

“It’s a handkerchief with count Ian Philip’s symbol. If in case you get interested on the information agency, take that handkerchief and go look for him. You can go and look for him. He will be of great help.”

An existence that made you greedy.

It wasn’t an easy decision to send that existence away to another person.

‘However, I can’t ruin Chris’s future because of my greed. Perhaps because of my greed, the information era will become more cruel.’

He was planning to give him choices.

Himself and Ian.

He decided to not mind whether he chose him or Ian.

‘Even so, I can’t do nothing about the bitterness.’

Roan smiled bitterly, and Chris also felt a headache.

‘Information agency? Investments? Count Philips? Ian Phillips?’

The went through many things in a short while.

A feeling that his thoughts were getting tied up.

But even in the middle of that, there was one certain thing.

‘Sir adjutant Roan’s feelings are the real deal.’

He could clearly feel his will and consideration to help him. Chris took in a deep breath and raised the pocket.

“I will use well the investment. I will certainly succeed in a big way and return it back.”

“Then you can just buy me a meal.”

Roan smiled brightly and shook his hand.

Chris’s words continued.

“And the handkerchief for count Philips.”

He returned it back to Roan.

“It’s something useless for me.”

Chris looked at Roan’s two eyes fixedly.

“If in case I get interested on the information agency, I won’t go to look for count Philips but to you. Because it’s also been you that taught me about the talent for information I had.”

Burning eyes.

Roan took in a long breath.

‘Did it turn out well?’

Chris didn’t choose Ian, but him.

He was so happy he wanted to jump, but he didn’t show it.

Anyways, Chris didn’t find any big meaning in information.

‘From now on, it will be the important thing.’

He had only took a step forward.

Roan put back the handkerchief and nodded.

“I understand mister Chris’s meaning really well. I will be cheering for you from far away.”

At those words Chris smiled faintly and lowered his head.

“I will also be cheering.”

Now, they really had to separate.

He took back some steps and bent his head.

“If perhaps you visit Miller, come to Lisa street.”

“Okay. I will certainly go.”

Roan smiled brightly and slightly bent his head.

Chris fell back and moved his feet.

Because his feet were really quick, soon he couldn’t see his back anymore.

“Is his talent really that outstanding?”

Pierce, that was standing next to him, asked carefully.

Roan slowly nodded instead of replying.

‘He’s one of the young existences that lead Rinse kingdom and also Ian Phillip’s right hand.’

Ian chose Chris as the best from even among his men.

The talents even an outstanding genius strategist acknowledged.

That was right Chris.

‘Even so, as I talk about young existences…….’

There were some people he remembered.

‘Rinse kingdom’s four gods.’

The four young existences that lead Rinse kingdom from his past life to prosperity.

Spear god Pierce, that was called to have the best spear skills and talents from all of history.

The outstanding genius strategist Ian.

The mad monarch that was perfect in every aspect but one.

Goldmaster Sale, that controlled 70% of Rinse kingdom’s commerce rights.

‘They are guys that will appear 5 years from now on if it’s short, and if it’s long in 10 years.’

Fortunately, he knew about them really well.

Excluding one.

‘Goldmaster Sale was the only person that didn’t have his past revealed.’

Not only that, but he was a person he didn’t know about his precise age, hometown and of course face.

‘One day I will meet him. No, perhaps would I already have met him?’

He decided not to think about it for long.

Anyways, it wasn’t something to be solved just because he thought of it.

Roan concentrated on the thing he had to do right now.

“Pierce.”

“Yes.”

“Let’s go.”

Pierce tilted his head at the ambiguous words.

“Where……..?”

At those words Roan shaked his spear.

“You have to learn Roan’s spearmanship.”

“Ah!”

Pierce let out a low exclamation.

And then, he smiled brightly and nodded.

“Yes! Teach me please!”

A loud reply.

Just in time, the west wind blowed.

*****

‘I did know that he was a genius…….’

Roan looked at Pierce while looking at Pierce.

He ran without stop and swung his spear.

Pierce took only 4 days on mastering Roan’s spearmanship.

Although the place he stepped on was a bit messed up, looking at it overall he got quite familiar to it.

‘It’s certainly an outstanding spearmanship, but it’s too difficult for normal spearmen to master.’

The Pierce of that moment when he had made it, was already high on mana handling.

Most of all, he couldn’t comprehend properly about normal people’s talents.

‘But if it’s now……’

The pierce from now didn’t master mana and lacked battle experience.

He was certainly closer to a normal person to when he made it on his past life.

‘He will be able to develop Roan’s spearmanship to an easier and stronger one.’

The reason why Roan taught Pierce.

‘Because this time he won’t just make it in an instant while being seated, but he will really ponder and investigate to make it.’

And he was planning on helping him so he could do so.

‘If it turns out as planned…..’

A smile appeared on his face.

‘I will be able to make the strongest spearmen squad on the continent.’

Roan’s spearmanship that will be born anew.

That would certainly become one of the basics for Roan’s strong military force.

Then, Pierce put back his spear and approached him with a refreshed expression.

“Roan’s spearmanship is really amazing. For a spearmanship to be this strong even without mana.”

“From now on, train and keep training. Then you will be able to see a new path.”

“Yes. I will bear it in mind.”

The two person looked at each other and laughed, and then moved their feet.

Because the promised time for the 12th squad members to gather had come.

As they got in to Karon’s bar, that was the appointed place, they heard a loud voice.

“Sir adjutant! Here! It’s over here!”

“It’s over here!”

The guys that yell while shaking their arms.

They were Austin and the 12th squad.

“Did we get a bit late?”

At Roan’s words, Austin shook his head.

“No. We also got just now.”

“On top of that, there’s someone that’s not even here.”

Lander said.

Roan looked at the squad members and nodded.

“Glenn’s missing?”

“Yes. He’s about to arrive.”

Austin laughed awkwardly and replied.

Then, Lander shook his hands and butted in.

“Well, he will come soon. First, I will order some food and alcohol.”

“Right. Do so.”

Roan sat on one corner and nodded.

Lander ordered various things.

‘I will also have to take about the vacations today.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

Shortly one month, and if it’s long three months.

In that while he had to leave rose troop.

He wanted to let this be known to the 12th squad members first.

‘I will have to say it when it’s about to end.’

He didn’t want to break the atmosphere for nothing at the start.

Then, big cups of beer filled the table.

“It’s our first squad meeting, so why don’t you say some words sir adjutant?”

Austin skillfully set up the atmosphere.

Roan didn’t decline and stood up.

“You have done well until now. I ask you to keep doing well.”

There was no need to saw some embarrassing things.

Roan raised his cup.

“For the 12th squad!”

“Hurray!”

The thick wooden cups clashed.

“Kuh.”

A feeling of his insides getting opened.

At that sight, Austin and the other squad members also emptied their cups. After the cup of beer got filled a few more times, the ordered food came out.

Really various foods.

“Eat this. It’s good food in the neighbourhoo…..”

Austin that was recommending food to Roan looked at the entrance and shook his hand.

“Glenn! Over here!”

Glenn had arrived.

Roan smiled faintly and turned his head towards the entrance.

At that instant, every movement turned slow.

Just like the world itself had stopped.

But this wasn’t because of Kalian’s tear.

‘Ah………..’

Roan’s sight went past Glenn and directed to the girl that was behind him.

Her hair was crisp, but it reached below her shoulders. Thick eyebrows, big and clear eyes, a pointy nose and red lips.

White skin unlike a commoner, and slightly bent head as if she was embarrassed.

The girl gave out a childish feelign and at the same time a mature feeling coming from a lady.

‘Seline.’

The girl he wanted to forget but couldn’t, and couldn’t forget but he had to.

That girl was right in front of him.

Chapter 39




“Sir adjutant Roan. I’m sorry for being late.”

Glenn laughed awkwardly and scratched his head.

Roan just nodded instead of replying.

Glenn pointed towards Seline that was still standing at the entrance.

“She’s my sister Seline. We went to our relative’s house because we had something to do, but the door was locked as if they were outside, so I brought her here. I’m sorry.”

Glenn apologized.

Roan looked at Seline as if he was barely listening.

‘Right, she was still a kid at this time.’

He was one year older than her.

She was stlil a 17 year old girl.

Because of that, there was a big difference from Seline from his memories.

‘We separated on our late twenties.’

She was certainly different than then.

But the feeling she gave was the same.

‘How crazy. For my heart to pound while looking at a little girl.’

He tried to ignore her, but his heart pounded by it’s own.

Then, Glenn’s voice was heard.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

A really rigid look.

“Ah.”

Only then did Roan get a hold of himself.

“You can’t do anything if the house is locked. Come along and eat something.”

“Thank you.”

Glenn lowered his head.

Seline, that was near the entrance, smiled shyly and also lowered her head.

“Thank you.”

A soft and nice to hear voice.

Glenn and Seline sat at the end of the table.

The atmosphere of the meeting changed in an instant.

The squad members that were on their early twenties showed great interest towards Seline, that was of the opposite sex.

“How old are you?”

“Your name is Seline?”

“Do you have a boyfriend?”

Pouring questions.

Roan smiled bitterly and raised his cup of beer.

‘If I decided to forget her, it is right to do so.’

He tried not to look towards Seline.

However he couldn’t do nothing about the conversations he heard.

“She doesn’t have something like a boyfriend. As you see she’s this ugly……”

Glenn’s words.

“Oppa.”

Seline called Glenn wit ha low voice, as if she was rebuking him.

However Glenn smiled faintly and shrugged his shoulders.

“What? What about it? You also cook terribl……”

“Oppa.”

Seline called Glenn once more time and frowned.

“Are you getting angry at me?”

“Ah, no. That’s not it……”

As Glenn teased her, Seline’s face turned pink.

A shy look.

Glenn continued teasing her as if that look of her was cute.

Seline got angry at times and pouted her lip.

A childish and cute look suitable for a 17 year old girl.

Roan sat slantly and listened to the conversation of the brothers.

‘She missed her brother forever……’

Looking at Glenn teasing her, he thought that it was really fortunate.

‘Right. I would like it if you were less sad in this life.’

Seline’s voice was really sweet and soft.

Then, Austin that was next to him, raised a duck meat dish.

“Eat this.”

It looked like he was giving it to Seline.

Roan, that was drinking beer and not paying any attention, raised another dish of meat.

“Not the duck.”

In that instant, Austin and the other squad members turned to look at Roan.

Only then did Roan realize the situation.

‘Damn…….’

The words came out unconsciously, and his hands moved first.

‘Seline can’t eat duck meat.’

He still remembered her eating habits and other habits.

An awkward silence flowed for a moment.

“Mm. No, it’s because I like duck meat……”

A poor excuse.

‘Roan. Do you call that an excuse just now?’

When he was rebuking himself.

Glenn smiled faintly and received the dish Roan was holding.

“You don’t have to give us duck meat. She can’t eat duck meat. Unlike how she looks, she also doesn’t eat a lot of things………”

“Oppa.”

Seline pinched Glenn’s side and rolled her eyes.

Boom.

At that moment, Roan felt a heavy rock sinking in his heart.

‘Whew. Those eyes……’

Even in his past life, he was weak on her rolling her eyes like that.

A feeling that he wants to pinch her cheek right now.

Roan raised the cup of beer again.

The squad members drank beer for quite a while and talked elatedly.

“Then, what’s miss Seline’s dream? You wouldn’t like to become a soldier like Glenn, right?”

Seline smiled shyly and shook her head.

“Then what do you want to do?”

Lander asked once more.

And Roan also showed interest for this question.

‘Seline’s dream? What was it? I think that she didn’t want to do anything in particular.’

He didn’t remember.

He remembered everything about her, but only that part was white like a sheet of paper.

Roan gulped down the beer and listened attentively.

“I…….”

Seline hesitated for a moment and then continued to say with a bright smile.

“I want to become a baker.”

Boom.

In that moment, Roan felt that someone hit his head really hard.

‘Baker……’

His face stiffs.

‘To have forgotten it like a stupid……..’

He couldn’t hold it because he felt pitiful.

‘Right. She said she wanted to become a baker.’

When they first met, and when it hasn’t been while since they started dating, Seline still dreamed of becoming a baker.

‘But because of me……’

Seline gave up on her dream because of Roan.

Fees to buy armour and spears, and also repair fees.

The things they had to offer for a promotion.

Seline pursued money for Roan instead of her dreams.

‘But a bastard like me….’

He thought of it as if it was really obvious.

That if he just became a great general, he would be able to make her live a good life.

The results? The worst of the worst.

‘Whew.’

The sigh surged up until his throat.

He couldn’t keep seated anymore.

Roan emptied the cup of beer in an instant.

“I will get more.”

Austin looked at the emptied cup and stood up.

Roan shook his hand and raised the cup.

“No. Don’t bother and keep drinking.”

A look of smiling brightly.

Austin smacked his lips and nodded.

Roan lent the cup to the owner of the store and leaned on a wall.

“What’s your hobby?”

“The food you like?”

The squad members didn’t have any control as they were pouring questions towards Seline.

Seline smiled shyly every time and she answered to the question quickly.

‘Seline.’

Roan looked at her bright and cheerful face and bit his lower lip.

‘The dream you gave up on your past life. I will help you so you can fulfill it.’

It still wasn’t a feeling like ‘I want to meet her again, or love her again.’

Now he simply wanted to help her on her dreams.

Then, Lander lent a dish.

A really spicy pork dish.

“Eat this too. It’s the most delicious on this store.”

“Yes? Ah……..Yes. Thank you.”

Seline hesitated for a moment and then nodded.

She looked at Lander’s face for a moment and after she smiled faintly she ate a piece of meat.

“How is it?”

Seline laughed awkwardly and nodded.

“It, it’s delicious. Really deli……”

The last part faltered.

Her face became red.

“Wha, what happened?”

Lander had a really perplexed expression.

Then, Glenn that was conversing with the others, looked at Seline’s face.

“Why are you like that?”

Seline pointed to a red pork meat instead. Glenn frowned.

“You ate this? You can’t eat spicy stuff.”

A rebuking sound.

Then, he lent her a cup of water.

Seline hurriedly empited the cup of water, but the spiciness still didn’t go away.

“Hoo. Hoo. Hoo.”

She opened her mouth roundly and let out short breaths.

“Wha, what do I do? Do, do you want to drink some beer?”

The perplexed Lander lent out a cup of beer.

“She’s still 17.”

The age you could start drinking was 18.

Glenn took away the cup of beer and filled it with water again.

Then, Roan approached without saying anything and placed down a big wooden cup.

“Hoo. Hoo. Hoo.”

Seline was still breathing out. She looked at the cup and at Roan alternately.

‘What’s this?’

Her big round eyes asked him that.

However Roan returned to his seat without saying anything while drinking beer.

Then she felt a really familiar aroma.

“Huh?”

Seline raised the wooden cup and smelled it.

In that moment, a bright smile bloomed.

‘This is bland tea.’

The tea she liked the most.

It was a tea which sweet flavor was excellent.

She grabbed the wooden cup with both of her hands and drank the tea.

A sweet flavor spreading in her mouth.

The spicy flavor that even made her teary disappeared.

“Whew.”

Seline let out a long breath.

Her bright face also returned to it’s original colour.

Only then did Glenn and Lander seem to calm down.

Seline bent her head towards Roan.

“Thank you.”

At those words Roan smiled faintly and nodded instead of replying.

‘She really like bland tea. Every time she drank it she said something.’

A way of expression used only by Seline.

‘Does she not use it yet……’

He felt regretful for nothing.

Meanwhile, Seline drank one more gulp of the bland tea.

“Haa.”

A brightly smiling face.

It was a face that made everyone who watched her also smile.

Roan unconsciously smiled brightly and shook his head.

‘Every time, after she drank bland tea, she would say dalkang dal……..’

When his thoughts were about there.

Seline covered her cheeks with her two hands and mumbled in a low voice.

“Ah. It’s dalkang dalkang.”

Her way of expressing others couldn’t understand.

Roan’s corner of the mouth raised.

‘It’s been a while.’

A happy yet dearing feeling.

Many scenes popped in his head.

Then, Keep’s voice was heard.

He had pushed away Lander and sat next to Seline.

“You said you didn’t have any boyfriend right? Then, what’s your ideal type?”

“I don’t have anything like that.”

Seline shook her head.

But Keep didn’t give up.

He pointed towards the others.

“Then who do you like the most among them?”

Seline looked at the squad members without saying anything.

“Sir adjutant Roan that’s the similar age as you? Or Pierce?”

At the questions, everyone’s sights were directed to Seline.

It seemed like everyone was curious.

Even Roan that was sipping some beer acted uninterested, but he was slightly interested actually.

Seline hesitated for a moment and carefully said.

“I…….”

When she talked up to then, the door of the store opened abruptly.

Boom!

At the same time, an urgent voice was heard.

“Sir adjutant Roan!”

Roan, that was concentrating on Seline’s reply, turned his head and looked towards the entrance.

“Huh?”

His two eyes that get big.

There was a person he hadn’t expected at all standing in the entrance.

“Sir adjutant Roan. It’s big trouble.”

The man that approaches.

Roan stood up with a surprised expression.

“Mister Chris. Didn’t you leave towards Dellon’s region?”

The owner of the voice.

It was Chris that had left Beno’s castle two days ago.

*****

Roan and Chris got out of the store and entered a secluded alley.

“Mister Chris. Didn’t you go to Dellon’s region to look for the old couple?”

“Yes. That’s right. I tried to.”

Chris nodded with a serious expression.

“But while I was travelling to Dellon’s region, I heard a weird story.”

“A story?”

Roan frowned.

“Yes. It’s a story I heard from the merchants that came from the north, but it seems like they saw a weird scene.”

Chris continued saying in a voice as if he was whispering.

“That the grass on the plains that had to be grown up were all stepped on it. Just like hundreds of horses ran over.”

A weird story.

Roan’s face stiffened.

“As it wasn’t barley or wheat, the merchants didn’t report it to the kingdom.”

Chris’s words continued.

“I also thought that it wasn’t important and was about to go to Dellon’s region, but maybe because of my temperament or my uselessly good senses, I wanted to go to check what the problem was on the north. So I went to the place where the merchants saw the weird scene.”

His words became faster.

“But when I was about to cross Kape’s mountain, I discovered a herd moving quickly. Even when they were far away, they moved so fast and roughly that the ground shook. At that moment I got the feeling. That the herd I saw was the one that destroyed the grass.”

“Could you also figure out the identity of the pack?”

Roan asked carefully.

Chris bit his lower lip and nodded.

“The identity of that herd…….”

A voice with a lot of strength.

“They were orcs.”

Roan opened his eyes big.

‘Orcs? An orc troop?’

An expression he couldn’t believe it.

All the orc troops were pushed away from the boundaries after Pedian’s plain monster subjugation.

Because of that, a situation where orcs could move in a troop was impossible.

‘But there’s no way Chris could have seen wrong.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

Chris’s words continued.

“There are at least 2 thousand orcs in the troop. They were all riding Lopuses.”

“Mmm.”

Roan forcefully gulped down the exclamation.

Lopus.

The monster that looked like a monster was smaller than a horse, but it had the characteristic that it was fiercer and attacked you more.

‘Just what kind of crazy orc, right after the subjugation finishes……’

Roan frowned and looked at Chris.

“Did you see the flag of the troop?”

At those words Chris smiled faintly and nodded.

“Fortunately, I could. The overall of the flag was crimson and was mixed with blue, and in the middle of that a black horizontal line crosses it.”

In that moment, Roan’s face stiffened.

‘If it’s crimson and blue, it’s the dead Sedek’s troop flag.’

A black horizontal line that crosses it.

It was a troop flag Roan knew really well.

‘It’s Violin’s troop.’

He looked at Chris and asked carefully.

“Wasn’t the orc leader leading the troop a female?”

“Huh?! That’s right. It was certainly a female orc warrior.”

Chris put an expression as if how did he know that.

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘Damn. For the wife of Sedek to appear so suddenly.’

Chapter 40




Violin.

She was an outstanding warrior even among the orcs from Rinse kingdom and she was at the same time the dead Sedek’s wife.

Her temperament was especially bloody that she cut off his dick after she realized that her husband Sedek had cheated on her.

“They are moving in a really complicated way evading the kingdom’s men and their territories, but I think that in the end their objective will be Beno castle.”

“And the reason you think like that?”

“Looking at the latest traces discovered and the place I discovered, I realized that they were moving to the southeast. If they keep charging forward like this……..”

“There will be Beno castle.”

At Roan’s words, Chris slowly nodded.

‘He certainly has talent in information.’

Roan was slightly amazed.

He took out quite a precise guess with Chris’s information.

‘Even so…..’

A faint shadow appeared on Roan’s face.

‘Is it for her husband’s revenge?’

Violin really loved Sedek.

Because of that, she couldn’t forgive the cheating Sedek.

A love closer to insanity.

Her husband that she loved that much died in the hands of a human.

‘Our rose troop, no, precisely speaking I would be her target.’

Seeing that they didn’t raid or attack villages while moving southeast, it was almost certain that they were moving for him.

‘It’s not a situation to be doing a squad dinner.’

Before Violin’s troop arrived, they had to finish preparations.

On top of that, their number was 2 thousand.

Compared to that, rose troop didn’t even have a thousand men.

Roan slightly bent towards Chris.

“Because of you I think that we will be able to prepare for their sudden attack. Thank you.”

Chris smiled faintly and shook both of his hands.

“No. I’m still far away of repaying your grace. But I was thinking…….”

He paused for a moment and asked with a little nervous face.

“May I investigate about the orc troop and their route?”

“Yes?”

Roan asked back with a surprised face.

A really unexpected question.

Chris continued saying.

“Won’t it be of help just by tracking their route?”

“That’s true, but it’s too dangerous.”

Roan stopped him with a serious expression.

However Chris rather smiled faintly and shook his head.

“I think that I will be able to do that much.”

A confident voice and attitude.

On top of that, he also seemed to have some fun.

‘He certainly is talented in this.’

Roan looked at Chris for a moment and then nodded.

“Fine. But instead, don’t approach them to the point it gets dangerous.”

“Understood.”

Chris hit his chest as if implying not to worry.

‘Even so, you want to run a normal travel agency?’

Probably Chris himself wouldn’t be able to hold it because it’s stifling.

“Then, I will be going.”

Chris saluted shortly towards Roan and got out of the alley with fast steps.

‘Should I also go?’

Roan also returned quickly to the store.

“Sir adjutant.”

Austin and the members all stood up.

They also felt that the situation wasn’t ordinary.

Roan smiled bitterly and looked at them.

“I’m sorry but we will have to end this here. Everybody, we are returning to headquarters.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Nobody asked the reason.

They only followed Roan’s orders.

Roan looked at Glenn.

“Glenn. You take your sister. If your familiars still aren’t back, wait and only then return.”

“Yes, yes. Understood.”

Glenn nodded with a confused expression.

Roan glanced at Seline.

It was a short moment, but their eyes met for the first time.

Zap.

At that moment, a corner of his heart felt numb.

‘It’s not the time to be like this.’

Roan forcefully shook his head and moved his feet.

Austin and the 12th squad followed his back.

The noisy table became empty in an instant.

Seline looked towards the entrance.

‘Mmm.’

She didn’t know why it felt regretful.

‘WHy is he so familiar?’

It was the first time she felt like this in her life.

The feeling that she felt something, found it back but lost it again.

Her big eyes gleamed with a weird light.

******

Roan explained the situation to the squad members and went to Gale.

“Troop commander.”

A sudden visit.

Gale, that was enjoying a cup of tea, smiled faintly.

“Roan. What happened now? I’m starting to feel scared whenever you come.”

Words that he spat jokingly.

However, Roan’s face was serious.

“That may really be the case.”

“Huh?”

Only then did Gale realize that the situation wasn’t normal.

He put down the cup and looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“An orc troop is approaching.”

A calm voice.

But the contents were shocking.

“Orc troop?”

Gale frowned.

It was because an orc troop almost didn’t move at this time.

Roan moved his feet to the center and pointed a map that was on the table.

“They are moving from the north to the southeast. I guess that their objective is here, at Beno castle.”

“Just why……..”

Gale frowned and shook his head.

Roan told him the story he heard by Chris.

Gale’s face stiffened by the time.

“Damn. Is it for revenge for his husband………”

He let out a sigh and looked at Roan.

“You entrusted that friend with the scouting?”

“Yes. He wanted to do it himself.”

“Is he trustable?”

“Yes. You can trust in him.”

Roan smiled without hesitation.

Gale nodded and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“We will have to go to the troops HQ for now. I will have to report it to the great commander. You can go together, right?”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan didn’t decline.

Gale soon called Kennis and the adjutants and ordered them to prepare for battle against the orcs.

“Then, shall we go?”

“Yes. I will take the lead.”

Roan got on the horse and grabbed the reins.

There was 2 days of distance between Beno castle and Ipen castle.

If they ran with the horse quickly they would be able to reach within a day.

‘I wanted to take a vacation, but a battle soon occurs.’

Roan smiled bitterly and kicked the horse.

Hiiiing!

The horse let out a long cry and started to run towards the south.

Gale also kicked his horse to not fall behind.

Dudududu.

The horse steps shook the earth.

*****

“Hmm. Mmm.”

Humming came out on it’s own.

Aaron felt quite happy nowadays.

The things he had planned were getting solved well and on top of that he found a guy he really liked.

‘Roan. He’s only 18 now but he will certainly become big.’

His awl in his pocket would show at any moment.

If Roan kept accumulating merits, people that desired him would appear.

‘Before that happens, I have to certainly make him mine.’

Countless plans appeared in his head and crumbled. After the pondering, he chose the first card.

‘Viscount Reil Baker has to show some interest.’

Aaron sent a letter to the prodigy spearman Reil. That he discovered a guy worth seeing over.

‘According to the reports of the adjutants, troop commanders and staff officers, it was standard. But the most amazing point……..’

Was that his skills got noticeably good in just a few months.

‘According to the report, his skills had changed when he first fought in Ale Gorge and in Prely River. According to Gale’s expression, it was like a newborn became a teenager overnight.’

It was certain that he had an amazing talent in the spear.

‘If he just can learn spearmanship from viscount Reil Baker, becoming the best spearman in the kingdom isn’t impossible.’

But of course he had his own worries.

If Roan wouldn’t be taken by Reil.

But Aaron believed in him.

No, he believed in his usual temperament.

‘Viscount Reil Baker is in a few words, a lone wolf. He doesn’t have interest in power.

‘Even if he did like Roan, he would only take him as a disciple, he wouldn’t take him fully.’

The reason why Aaron could ease himself and send him the letter.

‘If it just turns out as planned, Roan will be in a big debt with me.’

A smile appears on Aaron’s face.

He was planning on leaving Roan near him and raise him to become a general.

‘If Roan grows as my expectations……..’

He won’t’ just become a corps commander from an outer area, but he will be able to get into the center.

‘But of course, he has to grow according to my expectations.’

For that, he had pulled various cards.

‘If this succeeds, I’m immediately moving to the next one.’

His future plans were drawn in his head.

“Hmm. Mmm.”

Because of that a hum could only come out.

On top of that, there was another good notice.

‘Damn it. Even so, it’s still my birthday…….’

Aaron grabbed a letter that was at a side of the table.

A letter his daughter that was studying in Pavor castle sent.

It was a letter she sent before leaving towards Ipen castle.

‘She would be busy studying but she also insists on doing something for my birthday.’

For him, Mary Tate was a pretty and commendable daughter.

‘I should buy some good meat.’

The smile on his mouth became denser.

Then, the door opened abruptly and Mendel came in.

“Corps commander. Troop commander Gale and adjutant Roan came looking for you.”

An urgent voice and expression.

‘Gale and Roan?’

Aaron tilted his head and shook his hands.

“Tell them to come in.”

Right before he said that, Gale and Roan came in.

“Greetings to corps commander.”

A light salute.

‘What happened……..’

Aaron frowned.

Because Gale’s and Roan’s expression weren’t normal.

“What happened?”

At the short question, Gale gulped down dry saliva and replied.

“An orc troop is charging through.”

Boom.

In that instant Aaron’s face stiffened.

“Orc? What are you talking about?”

“That……”

Gale explained the situation he heard from Roan by now.

At the same time he spread a map of the eastern parts of the kingdom.

“With the information we have now, we grasped that they came from the north and are charging to the southeast. The number is about 2 thousand. They all are riding lopuses and their objective seems to be Beno Castle.”

A heavy silence.

Aaron looked at the map with ferocious eyes.

‘Orcs are charging to the southeast?’

A shock like someone hit his head.

‘It overlaps with the trajectory my daughter makes.’

The tip of his hands shake nervously.

‘It’s been 2 days since Mary departed from Pavor castle. She will soon reach Slan region.’

Mary was moving from Pavor castle to Beno castle with a northwest direction.

On the other hand, the orc troop was moving southeast.

‘There’s a high possibility they will meet at Slan region.’

Aaron took in a deep breath.

‘If she gets caught by the orc bastards……..’

Aaron shook his head.

A situation he didn’t even want to think of.

For Mary’s safety, he had to secure Slan region.

‘However we can’t face the orc troop in an open field.’

Just because of one daughter, he didn’t want to corner his underling soldiers.

His pondering deepened.

‘Is it my daughter, or the soldiers.’

Aaron fell in a deep thought between the roles of father or commander.

However Gale, that wouldn’t know of this, was burning inwardly.

A situation where even a minute was urgent.

“Corps commander?”

He called out to Aaron carefully.

Aaron looked at Mendel’s, Gale’s and Roan’s faces fixedly.

‘I am their commander.’

Soldiers are no different to his children.

‘I’m sorry. Mary.’

While he was finishing his thoughts, he made a decision.

“Their number aren’t that big, and as all of them are riding lopuses, close the castle gates and battle them as a fortress. I will dispatch troops from the corps headquarters.”

He made the order not as a father but as a commander.

‘Mary……’

His chest boiled.

Then, Mendel opened his mouth with a complex expression.

“Corps commander. If you do that, your daughter…….”

“Stop. Don’t talk anymore.”

Aaron shook his hand.

He tightly bit his lower lip.

“We are sending a messenger towards Mary.”

“But we don’t know if the messenger will even…….”

Bang!

Aaron hit the table.

“Then do you want me to drive my soldiers to a corner just to rescue one daughter of mine!”

A loud yell.

Only then did Mendel shut his mouth and step back.

His face was frozen stiff.

‘Corps commander………’

Mendel knew how well Aaron loved and appreciated Mary.

‘He always lived with boasting and praising.’

Even this time, he became so happy he was about to jump when Mary said that she would come to take care of his birthday.

‘That corps commander chose his underlings instead of his daughter.’

A cruel decision.

Mendel could feel Aaron’s boiling emotions.

Then, Aaron sent the order with such difficulty it seemed that he was vomiting something hot.

“Send a messenger to Mary.”

Gale and Roan grasped the situation late.

‘His daughter is coming to Ipen’s castle right now!’

They could understand why Aaron was pondering for a long while.

But just because of that, they couldn’t battle in an open field.

‘There’s no reason to face the orcs that are riding lopuses.’

As they grasped their surprise attack, they would close the castle gates and battle like that.

In the current situation, this tactic was the most adequate.

Aaron took in breaths and pointed towards the map.

“I will send you troops from the headquarters, so close the gates and prepa…….”

What he said until there Roan, who was silent until now, let out a short sigh.

He looked at Aaron, Gale and Mendel.

“Roan. Do you have something to say?”

Aaron frowned and asked back.

Roan shook his head with a short sigh.

“We can’t battle that way.”

Chapter 41




“Roan!”

Aaron increased his voice.

His face was bright red.

“If it’s because of my daughter, you can……..”

When he talked up to there.

Roan shook his head.

“It’s not because of that reason.”

A calm voice.

Aaron, Mendel and Gale looked at Roan.

There was a weird look on their faces.

Roan continued saying with a calm expression.

“Violin is hot tempered and violent. For her to charge straight towards Beno castle without plundering and pillaging means that her rage towards rose troop is really that great.”

He didn’t reveal himself to be her target of revenge.

The three others nodded.

Roan continued saying.

“In this kind of situation, when Violin arrives and finds that the gates are closed how will she act?”

The three couldn’t answer.

Roan drew a line around Beno castle.

“If it’s the hot tempered and violent Violin, she would annihilate every village around Beno castle.”

Boom.

In that instant, the three faces stiffened.

A problem they hadn’t thought about.

‘We just thought that we only had to block their surprise attack.’

We thought that Beno castle shouldn’t fall in danger.’

Thoughts that amounted that much.

However Roan was thinking what would happen even after that.

‘Well, there was a similar case in previous battles.’

As the situation was urgent, they had even forgotten that there was a precedent.

Aaron looked at the map with a serious expression.

“Certainly, if it’s the crazy female warrior Violin, there’s a high possibility she will do that.”

He couldn’t make the surroundings of Beno castle a wasteland.

Aaron looked at Roan.

“Then you think that we have to battle them on an open field?”

“Yes.”

A short reply but filled with confidence.

Aaron looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“Then what region would be suitable?”

At those words, Roan replied without hesitation.

“Obviously, Slan region.”

He pointed the northwestern part of Beno castle.

“This region is the starting point in the northwest, and there are villages surrounding it. To stop Violin’s troop he have to take Slen region as the starting point and make a blockade towards the northwest.”

A voice filled with certainness.

The three of them ruminated the words and looked at the map.

Just like Roan’s words, there were many villagers living in the northwestern part of Slen region.

‘We have to defend Slen region to save the villagers.’

‘We have to build lines in the northwestern part of the region.’

They all looked at Roan with surprised looks.

‘He’s a really amazing guy.’

‘Compared to others, he has the ability and insight to look through situations.’

‘Until where does his abilities spread to?’

Praises they couldn’t say it out loud.

Roan pretended not to notice that and pointed at the map.

“But this region is an open field. It’s an advantageous area for the orc troop that are riding lopuses.”

“Then what do we do?”

Aaron, Mendel and Gale looked at Roan while having forgotten their rank.

“I will have to go there myself. I want to check the topography of the region as well.”

He had experienced many things for the past 20 years and remembered a lot of information and knowledge, but unfortunately he didn’t remember much about things related to Slen region.

At those words Aaron nodded.

“Fine. I will go to the corps headquarters and give you the best horse.”

“Now that it turned out like this, I would like to go along with the 12th squad.”

“Do so.”

“Thank you.”

Roan lowered his head.

Aaron, Gale and Mendel looked at him with a fixed gaze.

“In this situation, it’s almost impossible to bring troops from another region.”

They needed quite a lot of time to prepare preparations and travel all the way to Slen region.

Aaron continued saying.

“I will dispatch you troops from the headquarters, so drive back Violin.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Gale, Mendel and Roan bent down.

Aaron’s eyes calmly sank.

‘If they can only defend Slen region……..’

The safety of the villagers would be acquired, but he could also get Mary’s safety.

killing two birds with one stone.

His sight directed to Roan.

‘Roan. I’m begging you.’

Soon, even Aaron was depending on Roan.

Roan was now holding a big importance inside the corps, even without him knowing.

*****

“Yes? An open field battle?”

“We are making a line on the northwestern part of Slen region?”

Expected reactions.

Gale smiled bitterly at the fierce reactions of the adjutants.

He explained with a calm voice everything Roan had said.

“Ah……”

Only then did the adjutants let out a low exclamation and get convinced.

“But even so, to face the orcs that are riding lopuses in an open field……….”

A ridiculous situation.

Gale pointed Roan with a gesture of his chin.

“For now, I will look how Roan checks Slen region.”

At those words, Kennis and the other adjutants all looked towards Roan.

Roan was looking at the map spread on the table.

‘Does he have something thought?’

‘If it’s Roan, he will have a mysterious tactic.’

Kennis and the adjutants gulped dry saliva.

Eyes filled with expectation.

However, Roan couldn’t hide his stuffiness while looking at the map.

‘The map is really a mess.’

Compared to the map 20 years from now on, it was a child’s scribble.

Only the villages, mountains, forests, and rivers were marked.

There were a lot of things that were excluded.

Roan’s finger pointed to one side of the map.

A white part that didn’t have anything.

‘Slen region…..’

His finger now moved to the northwest.

The region where they would have to fight the orc troop.

‘There’s a short gorge, forest, and river……..’

Just looking at the map, it wasn’t a topography that would be of any help.

‘Certainly, I will have to go myself.’

Roan turned his head and looked at Gale.

“Troop commander. Me and the 12th squad will depart right now.”

RIght before he said that, Gale nodded.

“Right. I already prepared the horses.”

The special 20 war horses Aaron prepared.

Roan saluted shortly towards Gale and the adjutants and went towards the abode of the 12th squad.

“Sir adjutant.”

The 12th squad were already ready for dispatch.

Nervousness could be seen on their faces.

“There’s no need to be nervous. We are just going to check how the territory is.”

A soft voice.

The squad members nodded unconsciously.

“To shorten the time, we will go riding horses. Who hasn’t rode a horse until now?”

At those words Glenn and Pierce raised their hands.

Even so, maybe it was because the other squad members have faced more battles, but they had experience on riding horses.

Roan entrusted them to Austin and Lander, that had the most experience.

‘From now on, to become a general that will lead a troop, they should at least learn cavalry.’

There were many things he had to teach them from now on.

‘But of course, I also have to learn.’

Roan’s eyes shone.

His objective changed from great general to monarch.

Now it was difficult if he simply relied on spearmanship, strategies and tactics.

‘There isn’t a subject called emperor’s studies for nothing.’

Now that he started, he wanted to become a monarch that was like a real monarch.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘I can do it one by one. But first……’

The danger in front of his eyes.

He had to concentrate on driving back Violin’s troop.

“Let’s go.”

“Yes! Understood.”

At Roan’s words, the 12th squad replied shortly and saluted.

After a while, several war horses rode down through the entrance of the troop’s headquarters.

Dudududu.

Horse steps that shook the ground.

Roan was in the front of the war horses riding quickly towards the northwest.

‘I need to come up with a good strategy and tactic. What a problem.’

His hands were grabbing the reins and his legs kicked the horse without stop.

But his head was spinning so fast about finding the adequate strategy and tactic from the many ones he knew, that a sound could be heard coming out of his head.

Swiiiiiiish.

The west wind blew scarily.

*****

Roan sat on the saddle and frowned.

Slen region was really an empty plain, just like its name.

Wherever they went, a wide and empty plain extended.

‘Even so, the finest place is this one.’

The place they found after checking the region thoroughly.

The short gorge, small forest and the deep river they have already checked on the map was near Midis village.

“The gorge of Plam mountain is too short, and Riten’s forest is also no good.”

Austin approached and let out a sigh.

Roan slowly nodded.

‘It’s difficult to see a big effect even when we ambush them in the gorge or set the forest on fire.’

Most of all, if they charged through the gorge and forest, they would be able to see the empty plain.

‘Even so, because of Slaion river that flows to the north, the size of the plain is narrower than elsewhere.’

Roan looked at the surrounding scenery with calm eyes.

‘Most of all, there’s a high possibility Violin’s troop will pass through this region.’

The shortest distance from the starting point to Beno castle.

‘I have to think of the most adequate tactic for the current situation. Is it certainly ambush? Or attacking with fire? Or if not, an inundation tactic again?’

Many thoughts filled his head.

Then, he heard Lander’s voice.

“Sir adjutant! The youth from that time came again!”

Lander, that was checking on the vicinity topography, appeared with a youth that had a shabby look.

“Ah!”

Roan let out a low exclamation and got off the horse.

“Mister Chris!”

“Sir adjutant.”

The youth had a shabby appearance.

It was Chris that had left to seize information about Violin’s troop and their trajectory.

Roand and Chris held hands.

“You aren’t hurt?”

“I’m fine.”

Chris smiled brightly and hit his chest.

He did seem exhausted, but an expression that seemed somewhat proud.

“Violin’s troop is somewhere located 4 days from here.”

“It’s quite a far distance.”

Roan frowned.

They were moving while riding lopuses.

Lopuses were as fast as horses.

And they were better when it came to instant changes in movements.

Because of that, he expected them to arrive in two days.

Chris smiled brightly and replied.

“First, their trajectory isn’t really effective as they are moving while avoiding the eyes of the region’s troop and residents. To top that off, they are moving in separate squads as they can’t move the 2 thousand together.”

Violin’s objective was making a surprise attack.

Because of that she didn’t want to face troops from another region and fight for nothing.

‘Stupid bastards. A true surprise attack is based on swift movements.’

The longer their trajectory became, they would be able to evade useless fights, but there was a big chance that the most important thing, being the surprise attack, would fail.

Chris’s continued saying.

“And because they moved without stop, the lopuses and also the orcs are quite exhausted. They are in the middle of resting after a long while.”

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“Because of that, we could earn some time.”

“This is the records of how their troop is composed and their formation.”

Chris lent out a small piece of paper.

Roan carefully received that and asked in a low voice.

“But how did you chase their tails?”

It wouldn’t be easy to chase the tails of the orcs that were riding lopuses and gather information.

At those words Chris shook his head.

“I didn’t chase their tails. I waited in front.”

“Yes?”

Roan asked back while opening his eyes big.

Chris smiled faintly and continued saying.

“At first, I checked the places they passed by and after that I registered and organized the information. After I did that, I could vaguely see their moving pattern. They were moving towards Beno castle tle while avoiding places where troops were stationed, places where people from the kingdom appeared, and also places where monster appeared.”

“Ah….”

It meant that he had guessed their trajectory beforehand with the basic information as the background.

‘He’s really a person I want.’

He gave meaningful results with limited information.

Roan bit his lower lip and looked at Chris.

“Then what’s the expected moving trajectory?”

At those words Chris smiled brightly and pointed below Roan’s feet.

“You chose a really suitable place. They will soon come over here.”

A voice filled with confidence

Roan didn’t ask any more.

‘If Chris says so, it will be it.’

A perfect trust.

“Then I will have to decorate this place to become a party.”

Roan smiled brightly and looked towards the gorge and forest.

At those words Chris put a surprised expression.

‘Does he believe my words?’

There wasn’t even a question if it was true or he was certain.

‘He believes in me, in my abilities.’

A corner of his heart became numb with proudness.

It was a really nice feeling being recognized by someone.

Chris forced himself not to smile and looked at Roan.

“But this isn’t that good of a place to make a party.”

At those words Roan smirked and shook his head.

“Even so, it’s the best place on our surroundings.”

He was certainly smiling, but his face was somewhat filled with worry.

‘For now I will have to make them confused with an ambush or attacking with flames. The problem…….’

Was when Violin’s troop got out of the forest or gorge and entered the plains.

The area was narrow because of Sleion river, but a plain was still a plain.

It was the best place for lopuses to run on it.

Compared to that, the military power they had was closer to something standard.

‘The composition itself is good, but compared to the orcs our mobility falls behind.’

If in case Violin didn’t choose to battle but to charge through, the empty Beno castle would fall in the hands of the enemies.

‘But although it won’t happen……..’

If he stepped in and revealed his identity, it would end there.

Because Violin’s objective would still be revenge for her husband.

‘Uhm. What method was there to face enemies with great mobility on an open field……..’

The many strategies Ian and the other excellent strategies made appeared in his head.

But there was no specific strategy that appeared.

Then Lander, that was next to him and listening to the conversation, let out a sigh and grumbled.

“Tch. If the orc bastards came a bit later we would be able to make a wooden fortress or an earth one.”

Even if it wasn’t completed it would still be good.

If they raised a long and strong wall on the other side of the river, even the orcs that were riding lopuses wouldn’t be able to act rashly.

“Stupid. How do we make a fortress in 4 days? If we could set up a formation, that would be fortunate on itself.”

Austin clicked his tongue and rebuked.

Lander nodded with a sulky expression.

“It was just my thought. My thought. Ahem.”

He cleared his throat and looked at the clear field.

“Won’t a cool fortress fall on the skies?”

When he was thinking about that.

Roan’s eyes, that was pondering, started to shine.

His sight passed through Lander and looked at the plain.

A peaceful scenery.

‘It’s that.’

A faint smile appeared on Roan’s mouth.

“Lander.”

“Yes?”

Lander felt intimidated for a second.

Roan grabbed his shoulders and nodded.

“It’s a really good thought.”

“Yes? What is?”

Lander asked back with a confused face.

Roan smiled faintly and replied.

“Let’s raise a fortress over here.”

Chapter 42





“This will really be fine, right?”

At Gale’s question, Kennis put on an awkward smile.

“Won’t it be?”

But it was a voice without confidence.

Gale, Kennis and the troop adjutants stood in one place and looked at the soldiers.

“This goes there! That’s over here!”

“Don’t stick them together!”

“It has to look natural!”

The soldiers moved between Midis village and the plains busily.

Gale forced a smile and looked at the youth giving the orders between the soldiers.

“Right. As the strategy was set up by Roan, there won’t be any problems.”

On the armor the soldier with the childish face was wearing, there was a badge symbolizing a class 5 adjutant. It was Roan.

Then, Roan shook off the dirt in his hands and approached.

“It’s time Violin’s troop came.”

At those words, Gale and the other adjutants nodded.

‘We couldn’t even set up a formation properly.’

They couldn’t even set up a common wooden fence.

Because they didn’t have the time to do so.

‘I wondered just what kind of bullshit it was to raise a fortress in this situation.’

Gale smiled bitterly.

‘Even so, we finished the preparations according to Roan’s strategy.’

If Violin’s troop fell on their trap, he could ascertain victory.

But what if the results weren’t good?

‘There’s a high possibility they will attack Beno castle.’

Gale ground his teeth.

‘We will certainly win.’

When he got a new resolution.

“Each troop and squads will have to move to their appointed places.”

Roan’s calm voice.

Gale nodded and looked to his right.

He could see Jefferson leading BlackBird troop that was part of their corps.

“Then, we will be moving.”

He slightly nodded and moved.

Gale and the rose troop had the commanding rights for this battle.

Jefferson could only move according to their strategies and commands.

“We are moving! Everyone to your appointed places!”

At his orders, BlackBird’s adjutants quickly ordered the soldiers.

“We are also moving!”

Continued by that, Gale let out the order.

Soon the cavalry, archers, swordsmen, etc. started to move towards Riten forest and Flam mountain gorge.

Rose troop and BlackBird troop.

The combined number of the two troops was 2,500.

They had at least 500 more than Violin.

‘Although it isn’t that we will certainly win because we have more numbers.’

Roan smacked his lips and looked back.

Only the spearmen remained on the field.

Roan raised his spear and yelled.

“It won’t be an easy battle! But…..”

A loud voice.

“We will win! Let’s show the orc bastards the power of humans!”

Right after he finished saying that, the spearmen raised their spears high and stamped it on the ground.

Bang!

A tremble and a heavy sound was heard below their feet.

The faces of the soldiers turned red.

A confidence they could win and that they would certainly win showed on their faces.

‘We will win. Certainly.’

Even for Roan, this battle held quite some meaning.

He faced through many battles since he returned to the past. But those were all battles he had been through in his past life.

Similar or the same.

Even so, they were battles he certainly had experience in or knew about.

But this battle was one that didn’t even happen in his past life.

Even Roan couldn’t know how the results would turn out.

‘I tied all the effective strategies in one place.’

He mixed all the best strategies according to this situation in one place.

‘I have to win.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

It wasn’t a battle he knew the future of.

The first battle he would face simply with his skills.

If he just attained victory on this battle, he would be able to get an incredible amount of experience and confidence.

Roan’s eyes shone.

‘Come you crazy female orc warrior!

His chest beat roughly.

He clenched his fists tightly.

‘I will send you next to the husband you love so much.’

The west wind blew again.

A killing intent was felt in the warm wind.

*****

A blade made by polishing animal bones.

The sharp and gray tip of the blade slashed through the arm.

Slash.

The flesh split and red blood flowed.

“Hrm.”

The owner of the arm licked the wound with the long tongue.

The blood soon stopped and only a wound remained.

A bloody wound.

Next to that, various additional wounds could be seen.

‘Don’t forget this pain. Before getting revenge for my husband, I have to suffer and feel pain.’

Eyes filled with madness.

Gray skin, rough and crumbly black hair, and the four canine teeth that sprouted over her mouth.

She put back the knife on her waist and stood up.

A body so big you wouldn’t be able to say that she was a female.

Adding to that, the arms and legs that sprout out of the armor were covered in muscles.

A look that made you understand how the capable orc soldier Sedek gave her his crotch.

Then, a heavy low voice was heard behind her.

“Troop commander Violin. We finished preparations to move.”

The owner of the voice was Kurk who served Violin nearby.

“You gave plenty of water to the lopuses, right?”

“Yes. We also gave them hog meat.”

At those words Violin nodded.

“There are no human troops in Slen region.”

Murderous intent could be felt in her voice.

“Until now we moved while evading the eyes of the human bastards. But starting from now, there’s no need to do so. We will charge through without stop. We will crush everything that blocks us and set it on fire. We will make an attack on Beno castle before they can finish their preparations!”

A blue fire appeared in her black eyes.

“Carve the eyes of rose troop soldiers and after you cut off their tongues rip off their limbs. And………”

Violin clenched her two fists.

“I will certainly take care of that bastard called Roan.”

At those words Kurk bent his head.

“Yes. I will pass it down like that!”

A really concentrated look.

‘After Sedek passed away, her temperament became fiercer.’

If you did something wrong, you could have your head cut off in that instant.

After a while, Violin’s troop finished preparations and charged towards Beno castle.

Kaang! Kaang!

The cries of the lopuses hit the skies and the earth.

But Violin’s troop that ran without stop, could only stop at the entrance of Slen region.

“Huh?”

Violin, that was leading the troop in the front, frowned. An unexpected scenery spread before her eyes.

‘Human?’

Starting from Flam mountain’s border and the spread Riten forest.

In the entrance of Riten forest, human soldiers were moving hurriedly.

‘There are human soldiers here?’

An unexpected situation.

Violin called Kurk with a gesture of her hands.

“It seems like our movements got leaked.”

“Even so, there are only tens of them.”

Kurk glared at Riten forest with fierce eyes.

“Just in case, take some guys and go over there.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Kurk hurriedly replied and took 500 orc soldiers and went towards Riten forest.

Until then the human soldiers seemed not to have noticed Violin’s troop, but they were still moving logs here and there.

Dudududu.

As the lopuses charged roughly, the ground trembled.

“Huh?”

“What’s this?”

The soldiers looked at the direction the sound was heard while still lifting the logs.

And then, their eyes got big.

“Huk! Damn! The bastards are already here!”

“Flee!”

“Flee!”

They got scared and started to run towards the forest while throwing the logs.

A look of fearing for their lives.

“Hmph! Cowards!”

Kurk looked at that and gripped the reins strongly.

He was planning to get in there in an instant and crush their heads.

Then, the lopus that Kurk was riding, started to shake its head to the sides roughly and let out a cry.

Kuaang! Kuaang!

Unpleasant movements and cries.

Kurk immediately pulled the reins and stopped the lopus.

The 500 orcs that were following from behind also lowered the speed and stood next to kukr.

Kng! Kng! Kng!

The lopuses all started to smell the ground at the same time as if they had agreed to beforehand.

Kurk frowned and made hand signs.

“Something’s not right. Check the logs the humans threw.”

“Yes.”

Some young orcs replied loudly and ran towards a log.

Crash.

As they crushed the log with a hand axe, a sickening smell was felt.

They frowned and yelled towards Kurk.

“The thing inside the log is oil!”

“There’s not only on the logs, but there is also a lot on the ground and on the grass!”

The orcs pulled out some grass with their hands.

Sticky oil got on their hands.

‘Nasty human bastards. So they wanted to attack with fire.’

Bloodlust appeared in Kurk’s eyes.

Meanwhile, Violin arrived while leading the main troop.

“What happened?”

At the short question, Kurk smiled coldly and replied.

“It seems like information got into the hands of the human bastards. They were spreading oil in Riten forest.”

“Oil?”

Violin frowned and looked towards Riten forest.

Kurk continued saying.

“But it seems that our speed was faster than what they had thought. They couldn’t finish spreading all the oil and they fled. Hahaha!”

A magnanimous laughter.

He really seemed like he was having fun.

‘Looking that the human bastards are trembling I really feel good.’

In the other hand, Violin that was known to be hot tempered was rather calm.

“If they couldn’t even finish this they wouldn’t have been able to set up a formation.”

Kurk slowly nodded.

Violin opened her eyes sharply and said.

“We are quickly moving towards Beno castle before the human bastards finish their preparations.”

“Yes! Understood.”

Kurk replied in a loud voice and shook his hand towards the orcs.

The orcs that were stopped momentarily started to move towards Riten forest.

Then, Violin’s voice was heard.

“Wait!”

At that instant, the orcs all stopped moving.

Violin glared at Riten forest that was silent and didn’t seem like it had any humans in it.

‘We have never encountered a human army until now. But……..’

Soldiers appeared on Slen region that originally didn’t have a human troop.

‘What if they escaping to the forest was a well made act?’

There may be some traps on Riten forest.

‘But it’s true that they still haven’t finished their preparations.’

Violin touched her canine tooth and shook her head.

There was no need to lower their speed while investigating the forest.

She had another choice.

“Let’s go to Flam mountain gorge instead of Riten forest.”

“Yes? The human bastards haven’t even finished spreading oil.”

Kurk shook his head as if he was complaining.

But Violin wasn’t planning on changing her thoughts.

“You don’t know about that. That could have been a trap by itself. Even so, there’s no need to take chances for nothing. We are going to Flam mountain gorge.”

“A gorge is a really good place for enemies to hide in ambush.”

Kurk said with a worried face.

But this time also Violin shook her head.

“As the length of the gorge is short, even if they are lying in ambush it isn’t that big of a problem. We will pass through it quickly.”

She raised her large blade to the sky.

“Let’s go! Our objective is Beno castle!”

“Waaaaaaa!”

The orcs all yelled in one voice and pulled the reins.

The heads of the lopuses that was looking at Riten forest turned to Flam mountain gorge.

Dudududu.

A sound shaking the ground.

Violin’s troop only left a dust cloud and disappeared in an instant.

Swish.

Then, the grass of Riten forest shaked and the soldiers that threw away the wooden logs appeared from it.

The guys that were pale and screaming even a while ago.

But now they were putting a faint smile.

“Until now, is everything going according to our plans?”

At the words of one soldier, another one nodded.

“Yes, until now everything is going according to what adjutant Roan said.”

At those words the soldiers all had amazed expressions.

‘He’s really an incredible person.’

‘To lead the more than 2000 orc troop with only tens of people to where he wants.’

‘He’s not someone that would end simply as a spearman.’

A surprise look could be seen on them.

Then, one soldier clapped his hands.

Clap!

“Now! There’s no time to be idling like this. Let’s pass to the next thing quickly!”

“Right! Let’s hurry.”

“Hurry up!”

The soldiers nodded and started to move busily.

Roan’s plan still didn’t end.

No, precisely speaking now was only the start.

Chapter 43




‘They really are coming.’

Jefferson had a surprised look.

His sight was directed to below the gorge.

Dudududu.

Violin’s troop appeared along with a dust cloud.

‘I thought that it was impossible.’

When I first heard of it I thought that it was absurd.

But he couldn’t ignore him.

‘It’s the strategy made by that Roan, that thought of the Prely river inundation tactic.’

He hid himself in Flam mountain gorge while having his doubts.

‘But for them to really come over here.’

When normal people passed through this region, they didn’t use a bulky ground road, but a path in the forest.

Because the forest was wider and more comfortable.

‘If we had the time to prepare and attack with fire, it would have been better to lure them to the forest….’

They lacked time to spread enough oil.

On top of that it was also a problem that the wind blew from the west.

‘If we made a mistake, we could be the ones bathed in fire.’

Violin’s troop had slightly changed their direction.

The reason is that they chose the east to charge through Beno castle in the shortest time possible rather than going to southeast.

And making preparations for this, Rose troop and BlackBird troop left back Sleion river that was in the north, Riten forest and Flam mountain that was west and chose to wait on the plains that were in the east.

Because of that, there was a high possibility for them to get covered in flames because of the wind that blew in the opposite direction.

In the end Roan chose ambushing in the gorge rather than attacking with fire.

But for that, he had to lead Violin’s troop to the gorge instead of the forest.

‘For him to succeed doing it with only tens of soldiers.’

He completely tricked them with only a few oil barrels and thirty soldiers.

‘He’s really an amazing guy.’

He thought that he could now understand a bit of a reason as to why these many people showed that big of an interest.

Dudududu.

The lopuses charged through roughly.

The soldiers, that were hiding on the sides of the mountain with the gorge in between, felt that their bodies were trembling a little.

Then, Jefferson stood up and raised his hand high.

“Attack!”

The order fell.

The flagman shook the flag roughly to the sides.

“Waaaaaa!”

“Kill!”

“Roll the rocks!”

“Fire arrows!”

The archers fired arrows and the swordsmen rolled rocks.

Sweeeeee! Roooooooooll!

A sharp sound and the sound of rocks rolling was heard.

“Damn!”

Violin, that was charging roughly at the front, looked at the falling arrows and rocks and cursed.

‘They were preparing to attack with fire in the forest and they prepared for an ambush here?’

Then it meant that they had been quite prepared for it.

‘At the slightest slip it gets more difficult.’

They may need to make a big battle in Slen region while not being able to get to Beno castle.

‘Damn!’

Curses followed.

‘Just what troop are you! What are your identities!’

Her eyes got red.

Her hot temperament slowly showed itself.

“Kukh!”

“Kek!”

Then, the cries of the orcs were heard.

‘Kugh. It’s not the time to be here!’

Fortunately, her boiling temperament calmed down.

“Charge! Charge while only looking at the front!”

Violin yelled towards the orc warriors with all her strength.

The distance of Flam mountain gorge was short.

If they charged in even a bit faster they would be able to get out of it.

Kung! Puk!

“Krr!”

“Kugh!”

The orcs that fell behind the troop got hit by the rocks and the arrows and fell.

But certainly, even if the gorge was short, it was too short.

Among the 2000 orcs, only 200 lost their lives in the ambush.

The others got into the plains safely.

“Whew.”

Jefferson looked at the orcs getting out of the gorge and let out a long sigh.

At first glance, it seemed like he hadn’t fulfilled his role well.

But on his face, a satisfying smile could be seen.

“He really got it right.”

When he first heard of this strategy, Roan had clearly said.

With the ambush in Flam mountain gorge we won’t be able to give them that big of a blow.

Not that good of words in the position of the troop commander and the soldiers.

‘Soldiers want to accumulate merits.’

Then Roan smiled brightly and said.

There’s a task more important than the ambush.

Then, the words that followed made him hit his knee.

‘Then, shall we quickly go down?’

Jefferson made a hand sign towards the flag man and sent down the order.

“Descend! We are going down the mountain path!”

Strength could be felt in his voice.

“We will block their road to escape!”

The battle hadn’t even started, but to talk about escaping.

A weird order was sent.

“Waaaaaaaaa!”

“Quickly, move quickly!”

But no one had their doubts.

The soldiers got down into the gorge quickly and started to sever the mountain path.

*****

Dududududu.

Violin’s troop rode quickly towards the entrance of the gorge.

In that moment, a wide plain was seen in front of their eyes.

“Ah…….”

Violin pulled the reins along a low exclamation.

Her expression stiffened..

Her eyes that were filled with bloodlust lost their trajectory.

‘Just what is…..’

She couldn’t believe the scenery in front of her eyes.

Violin and all the other orcs stopped.

Everyone had perplexed looks.

“Thi, this looks just like a fortress.”

Kurk approached and frowned.

Violin nodded without saying anything and glared at the front.

There were wagons, that had night soil buckets, lined up on the plains.

The wagons and the buckets were ordinary ones you could see anywhere.

But looking at the hundreds of wagons lined up as if it was surrounding the entrance, the intimidation it gave was incredible.

On top of that, the wagons were linked with ropes so you couldn’t try to force your way.

‘In this situation, we won’t be able to fully use our movement.’

They needed space for the lopuses to run however they wanted.

‘In the end it means that we have to charge through one place…..’

Charging through the north was meaningless as they would face Sleion river later.

In the end they had to choose between the east and the south.

Violin’s eyes moved quickly.

‘To the south? Or to the east?’

The pondering deepened.

Then, a heavy sound hit their ears.

Boom.

At the same time, the many wagons started to move their direction along with the sound of wood tangling.

Drrrrrr. Click! Drrrrrr. Click!

The wagons started to line up towards one direction.

Boom.

Once more time, they felt a heavy shock.

This time, the wagons started to slowly move.

Drrrrrrrrrr.

Sound of wheels spinning.

“Huh?”

“What?”

“The, the castle is moving.”

The orcs looked at the wagons closing on them with a perplexed expression.

‘They weren’t just standing still?’

Violin was also hugely surprised.

Meanwhile, the wagons that were at quite some distance closed the distance.

Bang!

The wagons took positions along with a heavy sound.

Pat!

At the same time, the long spears that were inside the buckets and below the wagons showed themselves.

The sharp tips of the spears pointed towards the orcs.

A moving wagon fortress and the spears that were like spikes.

“Troo, troop commander Violin.”

Kurk gulped down his dry saliva and called out to Violin.

But she didn’t reply.

She just glared at the wagon fortress with fierce eyes.

Then, an orc that was at the rear yelled.

“The gorge is blocked! Humans are approaching from the gorge!”

At that voice, some orcs assented.

But Violin didn’t show any reactions.

‘They should be the ones that ambushed us.’

She took in a deep breath.

‘Damn. To think about making a fortress with wagons and buckets.’

She wanted to see the bastard that thought of this at least once.

‘Although the situation is difficult……’

But in this situation they couldn’t keep idling.

If they delayed any longer they would suffer a pincer attack.

‘We will charge through.’

Although they would take some losses, the priority was to charge through and go to Beno castle.

Then, one man showed himself over a wagon.

He had a childish face but he was a youth that had a rank 5 adjutant badge on his chest.

It was Roan.

Violin frowned.

“So you are the commander?”

Roan just smiled faintly instead of replying.

‘It should have been perplexing.’

They used wagons and buckets to limit their movements, no, made a fortress.

There was no strategy like this until now.

‘A strategy that would be used by a rebel of Estia empire 5 years from now on.’

But of course it wasn’t exactly the same.

The rebel army used broken carriages instead of wagons and buckets.

On top of that there was a big difference in the strategy Roan used.

And that was that Roan’s fortress could move.

‘Lander’s words became the decisive help.’

That it would be good if a fortress fell from the skies.

Then, the various wagons and buckets that were on the plains came into his view.

‘This place is narrow because of Sleion river. On top of that, the yielding of the crops is really good so there are plenty of wagons and buckets provided per village. A good condition to make a fortress with wagons as a blockade.

A strategy that fit perfectly with the surrounding topography.

‘Until now, everything happened as planned. Then, let’s also work hard together. Violin.’

Roan smiled faintly and pointed at Violin with his spear.

“I’m the class 5 adjutant from Rose troop that belongs to the 7th corps of Rinse kingdom.”

Violin frowned.

‘Roan?! If it’s Roan!’

Roan read Violin’s thoughts.

“Right. I’m the one that slew Sedek.”

Boom.

Violin’s face instantly stiffened.

At the same time, her gray skin started to turn red.

Rage.

Her two eyes became filled with amazing madness.

Srung.

She pulled out her wide blade.

“I finally meet you.”

A voice that was filled with bloodlust.

“I won’t have to go to Beno castle.”

Even her eyes turned red.

“I will skin you and chop you into thin slices. I will make you beg me to kill you.”

Violin ground her teeth.

A look that she would attack if he replied.

Even so, Roan’s expression was relaxed.

“You should have really loved your husband.”

His voice was composed.

“If you want it, I will send you next to your husband.”

Roan tilted his finger.

“Come.”

A short provocation.

“I, I will kill you!”

Violin couldn’t hold it anymore and exploded in rage.

She kicked the lopus and ran towards Roan.

“Uh? Huh! E, everybody follow troop commander’s back!”

Kurk was surprised but pulled the reins after he sent the order.

“Troop commander! Troop commander Violin! You can’t get agitated!”

He followed Violin’s back closely and yelled.

The other orcs also kicked the lopuses and moved quickly.

Roan kept standing on top of a wagon with a composed expression.

The orcs that were close to 2000 came charging with a ferocious intent and their formation wasn’t messed up at all.

“I will chew you down!”

Violin that came charging with a ferocious intent.

“Guard the Troop commander!”

“Charge! Charge!”

The orcs that followed her back.

The orcs lowered their bodies and grabbed the reins to catch up with Violin.

Then, Violin who was in front, stopped in front of the wagon fortress.

“Bastard!”

Violin shouted towards Roan that was as close as her reach.

The lopus seemed to know how its owner was feeling, and it charged through with strength.

At that moment!

Psk.

Its front legs got buried on the ground.

Kaang!

A cry as if it was perplexed.

Kung!

The lopus hit its head on the ground and fell forward.

Udkkk.

It was the sound of its neck breaking.

It was an instant death.

Violin, who was riding it, also bounced to the front.

‘Kgh!’

She twisted her body and tried to balance herself.

Boom!

Violin rolled on the ground with a heavy sound.

Continued by that, the orcs that followed her back also fell on the same trap.

Boom. Booboom!

“Kuk!”

“Huk!”

Only after hundreds of orcs fell, Violin stopped the charge.

“Uhhhhhhhh.”

Violin stood up with a cry that seemed to be that of an animal.

She grabbed the blade that was rolling on the ground and started to move again.

Her objective was Roan.

Violin had already lost her nature because of the rage.

“Uaaaaaa!”

She let out a yell.

Tat!

She charged to the front and went towards the wagon.

“Where do you!”

“Get the head of the orc leader!”

The soldiers stabbed with their spear with all their strength.

Spat!

The spear passed next to her.

“Don’t interrupt!”

Violin swung her blade while having the spear in her armpit.

Slash!

The strong spear got sliced off in an instant.

“Huuk!”

“Hup!”

The spearmen gulped in air and became afraid.

However Violin wasn’t interested in them at all.

She continued charging towards Roan.

“I will face you!”

Then, Pierce appeared while saying it with strength.

Spat!

The spear that moves strangely and cuts the air quickly.

Pierce was different from normal spearmen even with the movements.

Stab.

The spear danced and slashed Violin’s body in a big way.

The corner of Pierce’s mouth slowly raised up.

‘How is it? This is sir adjutant Rian’s spearma…..’

His face instantly turned stiff.

“Kuuuuuu.”

Violin gave away her body and snatched Pierce’s spear.

“Kuk!”

Pierce pulled the spear with all of his strength but it didn’t even flinch.

‘Impossible! How is she this……..’

His talent was certainly outstanding, but he still lacked experience.

As another situation happened contrary to what he was expecting, he lost his calm.

“I’m sure I told you not to interfere.”

Violin smiled ill naturedly and raised her blade.

“Huh!”

Pierce was perplexed and his body froze.

Slash!

At the same time, the wide blade cut through the air.

‘Ugh!’

Pierce ground his teeth as he thought that he would die like this.

Then!

A strong spear appeared and hit the side of the wide blade.

Clang!

A clear sound of metal.

“Kuk!”

Violin’s arm and blade bounced off.

Meanwhile Pierce was blinking with a surprised look.

The owner of the spear showed himself.

“Pierce. You rest in the back.”

It was Roan.

He had a really faint smile on his face.

“This crazy orc is my guest.”

Chapter 44




He knew about Violin’s hot temperament really well.

‘If it was a commander with a calm temperament, this kind of strategy wouldn’t have worked.’

The average commanders would have sent a scout team when they discovered the soldiers spreading oil on Riten forest.

‘But Violin wouldn’t have had the leisure to do so when she had to quickly charge through to Beno castle.’

Because of that, she perfectly fell into the trap Roan had prepared.

Furthermore the biggest problem was..

‘This is not the end.’

Roan smiled faintly and looked at Violin.

“Die!”

She suddenly swung her blade.

A quick and strong blow that was hard to follow with the eyes.

However Roan had Kalian’s tear.

That fast and strong blow was so slow in his eyes it made him yawn.

Also it was to the point that he could count the amount of dust on the blade.

‘If it only didn’t place strain on my eyes I would be invincible.’

If you started to forcefully see a movement slowly, it placed an incredible amount of strain on your eyes.

‘Above that, it’s not that it’s leisurely.’

Just because he could see everything slower didn’t mean that his movements were also free.

Taat!

He charged to the front to dodge the blade.

However his body reacted so slowly it clogged his breath.

‘Damn. My physical abilities can’t follow my sight at all.’

In his thoughts, he wanted to lightly dodge the blade that was so slow it made him yawn and after he closed in on her he would punch her five times and then slice her head off.

But his hands and feet couldn’t follow his will.

Spat!

The tip of the blade closely passed by his chest.

“Hmph!”

Roan snorted and swung his spear.

The spear drew a line and went towards Violin’s top of the head.

Cheng!

Violin pulled the blade without much difficulty and after she blocked it she closed in on Roan.

As she was also an experienced warrior, she knew how she had to face a spearman.

But unfortunately, Roan was much more of an experienced soldier than Violin.

Roan spun the spear to block at the stabbing blade and then twisted his wrist.

Pabat!

The long spear spun like a windmill between Roan and Violin.

Checheng!

The blade that was trapped on the spear flew off.

Roan turned his shoulders and stood slanted.

The spear that was spinning like a windmill and drawing a beautiful arc went in to cut off Violin’s neck.

“Kugh!”

Violin ground her teeth and dodged the spear by lowering her head.

‘I have to counter……’

She wanted to at least stab him in the chest.

But she couldn’t even try it.

On the place where the blade of the spear passed by, the end of the spear took place.

“Damn!”

Violin cursed and lowered her head once again.

Spat!

The end of the spear that passed by closely.

Violin thought that this was the opportunity.

Because Roan cut off the air twice.

Even at first glance, Roan’s upper body was unguarded.

Swung!

The blade cut through the air and was accompanied by a heavy sound.

Just like they say, right before his head got smashed.

The spear that passed next to her soon returned and blocked the blade.

Tung!

A heavy shock.

“Ikk!”

Violin put more strength while grinding her teeth.

Kigigi.

The blade passed through the spear along a displeasing sound.

‘Just how is she this strong……’

In this situation, even Roan couldn’t help but get perplexed.

Violin showed a more powerful strength than what he had thought about.

‘If it wasn’t for the spear Corps Commander Aaron gave me, it would have split in two.’

It was a strength that amazing.

Even so, it wasn’t the time to feel leisure.

Because even right now Violin was eating up the spear with her blade.

Roan pulled his right leg back and twisted his body and the spear lightly.

Kigigigi.

The blade that was gearing with the spear slipped off and fell to the ground.

“Kugh.”

Violin’s body fell to the front as she lost balance.

Roan turned around while having his body tilted and hit the back of Violin’s head with his spear.

Puk!

“Ugh!”

Violin fell to the ground along with a heavy shock.

Roan pointed his spear to her back and tried to stab her.

‘Where do you dare!’

Violin quickly rolled on the floor and went in to cut off Roan’s talon.

Roan didn’t get perplexed and jumped while stabbing the spear on the ground.

At the same time he was falling down, he kicked Violin’s side.

“Hmph!”

As it was an attack Violin also expected, she lightly rolled her body and dodged.

She stood up from the place and swung the blade fiercely.

Roan didn’t fall back either and went in to stab his spear.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The spear and the blade clashed and metal clashing was heard.

Violin certainly overwhelmed Roan in strength and stamina.

However Roan was so quick to the point it was difficult to believe and showed a good sense.

On top of that, his skills in handling the spear was also impressive.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The clash of the two people continued without knowing the end.

Meanwhile, around the wagon fortress, quite an ordinary battle was happening.

As the lopuses and orcs fell in the trap and got stuck on the ground, the soldiers that were hiding behind the wagons showed themselves while holding their spears.

“Kill them!”

“Kill them before they get up!”

Tens of spears moved while cutting through the air.

“Kugh.”

“Damn. Just what is……”

The orcs hurriedly brought their hands to their waists.

But the movements of the soldiers was faster than theirs.

Slash. Stab.

The sharp blade pierced the orcs’ bodies.

“Kugh.”

“Kek!”

“Da, dam……”

Their last words they couldn’t even finish.

Kurk, that was checking on the situation, yelled with all his strength.

“Attack! Everybody attack! Rescue your allies!”

At that order, some orcs that had stopped in front of the trap, grabbed the reins of the lopuses.

Koong! Koong!

The lopuses jumped over the traps along a cry and started to run towards the soldiers.

The orcs swung their blades with a bloody intent and yelled.

“Human bastards! Receive the blade of an orc warrior!”

“Nasty bastards! I will show you what a soldier is!”

An atmosphere that a rough collision would happen anytime.

Then, the soldiers that were killing off the orcs on the ground turned back and started to pass the fortresses.

A perfect retreat that happened on an instant.

The soldiers hid their bodies again behind the wagons and stuck out their spears.

The orcs that were charging through became just like a dog chasing a chicken that ended up looking at a roof.

“Thi, thi, these bastards…….”

Kurk’s face became red.

He also had a hot tempered side in him, probably because he also served that kind of troop commander.

“Attack! Attack! Kill the human bastards! Push over the buckets and break the wagons!”

An order sent down stubbornly.

Violin was driven by insanity and was clashing with Roan.

The orcs could only follow Kurk’s order.

“Attack!”

“Kill them!”

An ignorant charge towards the fortresses begun.

When they got near the wagons.

“Bring them down!”

The yells of the adjutants and squad commanders shook the battlefield.

The soldiers that were hiding themselves got up in an instant and pushed the buckets.

The buckets shook for a moment and started to fall.

Boom! Boom!

A heavy sound.

The bucket fell towards the orcs that were running towards the wagon fortress.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh!”

The orcs couldn’t dodge and got squashed by the buckets.

“Dodge it!”

“Stop! Stop!”

But the majority of the orcs succeeded in grabbing the reins and stopping the lopuses.

‘What is it? Why are they breaking the fortress with their own hands?’

‘What are you planning now?’

The orcs looked at the buckets with uneasiness.

Then a loud yell was heard.

“Roll it!”

“Roll!”

At the same time, a long and huge cylinder shaped bucket started to roll with a heavy sound.

“Huh?!”

“Uh, uh!”

The orcs pulled the reins with a surprised expression.

The lopuses started to slowly walk back.

Crush.

As the bucket was one huge cylinder, it passed the digged ground and traps without trouble.

Perhaps, if they moved it along the wagon, the wheels would have fallen in the traps.

The speed the bucket’s roll started to increase.

The soldiers started to push the bucket with more strength and in unison.

“Da, damn! Block it! We also have to stick together and stop it!”

Kurk swung his blade and yelled.

If they just let it be, they would really end up inside their trap.

‘Damn!’

‘Can’t do anything about it!’

The orcs also knew very well about this truth.

They couldn’t do anything about it, and got down the lopuses and started to stick on a side of the bucket.

At that moment!

Spat! Pabat!

Behind the buckets, tens of long spears surged up.

That was different from a normal spear.

The length of it was almost twice of it.

‘Bastards, this is a real long spear!’

‘It’s the provisional long spear adjutant Roan thought of!’

These were all pieces of work made by Roan that he made one by one.

The soldiers stabbed the long spear between the spaces of the buckets.

As the length of the bucket was quite big, if it was an ordinary spear it wouldn’t have reached the orcs.

However, with the spear Roan made, it was enough to attack the orcs that closed up on the bucket.

Stab. Slash.

The sharp blade of the spear pierced the bodies of the orcs.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh.”

The orcs, that were trying their hardest to stop the rolling buckets, fell at the spears that appeared out of nowhere.

Because of that, the morale of the soldiers raised even more.

“Kill them!”

“Don’t leave even one of them!”

The long spears cut the air along a loud yell.

At the same time, the buckets rolled without stop and closed in on the space of the orcs.

Stab. Crush.

“Grr.”

“Kuk!”

The orcs were stabbed by the spear or got crushed on the buckets and started to fall back little by little.

‘Damn. This became difficult.’

Only now did Kurk get ahold of himself.

The rage that made his head messy, calmed down in an instant.

‘Like this we will get annihilated! Annihilated!’

It was a situation where they may really go to hell to meet with Sedek.

The number of the orcs that were close to 2000 lowered to 1000 at the attack of the fortress and the buckets.

‘For now, we have to survive.Only if we do would we be able to take revenge or do something!’

Kurk quickly checked his surroundings.

‘The east, south and north are blocked by that damned wagon fortress and buckets.’

In addition, even if they charged through the east or south, they would get even deeper to enemy territory.

In the end, what was left was Flam mountain gorge and Riten forest.

But even this wasn’t an easy situation.

‘The human bastards are blocking the gorge and the entrance for Riten forest………’

Riten forest was placed slightly more north than Flam mountain gorge.

Because of that, the wagon fortress that was blocking the entrance was at the back of it.

Kurk’s sight goes to the north.

‘If we flee towards the gorge where humans set up defenses, that’s no different to suicide. In the end what’s left is going to Riten forest.’

There was the fortress and the buckets, but the feeling the fortress of the east was different.

A somewhat sloppy feeling.

Even the speed that the buckets come rolling seemed slower.

‘We will charge through the fortress in the north and we retreat through Riten forest.’

In an instant a plan was made.

Kurk looked at Violin.

She was still battling Roan.

It didn’t look like she was being pushed back even while dodging the buckets.

‘If I tell her to retreat, she will make a scandal.’

But he wasn’t in a leisure situation where he could receive her tantrum.

‘Can’t do anything about it. Even if I get punished later on, surviving comes first.’

Kurk got on the lopus and raised his right hand.

“Advance party to the front!”

At those words, the biggest and boldest ones got to the front.

Kurk revealed his plans in detail.

“Kuak!”

“Kuk!”

“Grr!”

Meanwhile, the orcs fell one by one as they couldn’t hold back the charging of the buckets.

Kurk’s face became urgent.

“You all understood?”

“Yes! Understood.”

The advance party all nodded and ground their teeth.

They rode their lopuses and started to ride in a high speed.

Their objective was Roan and Violin.

“Huh?! Sir adjutant is in danger!”

“The orc bastards are coming!”

The soldiers that were pushing the bucket yelled with an urgent expression.

Austin, Pierce and the 12th squad members raised their spears and ran towards Roan.

However they couldn’t beat the lopuses that had better mobility.

They reached in front of Violin and Roan in an instant.

Half of the orcs attacked Roan and the other half assaulted Violin.

“Tch!”

Roan, that was pressing Violin fiercely, bit his lower lip at the sudden attack.

In the other side, Violin yelled towards the orcs that were grabbing Violin’s arms and legs.

“Let go! Let me go!”

But the orcs didn’t react at the orders.

They tied down Violin with a rope they had prepared.

Kurk, who arrived late, carried her on his lopus.

“Pardon my negligence.”

“Kurk! Let this go! Let me go! I have to kill that bastard!”

Her eyes and voice were filled with madness.

Violin struggled to break free of Kurk.

Kurk didn’t mind her and pulled the reins and went towards the north.

“Troop commander. Like this we will get annihilated. Annihilated. Don’t we have to be alive to at least be able to take revenge?”

“Shut up! Untie this, this instant!”

Violin didn’t even want to listen to Kurk.

But Kurk was also that way.

He didn’t react at Violin’s words at all.

Rather, he yelled towards the orcs in a loud voice.

“Retreat! Retreat! Advance troop, open a path!”

Right before he sent down the order, the orcs that were tying down Roan fell back as fast as a current of water.

They crossed the plains and rode towards the north that was blocked by the wagon fortress.

A well ordered look.

Kurk continued to yell.

“Follow the advance troop! Follow them!”

“Waaa! Pierce through!”

“Open a path to flee!”

The orcs yelled and kicked the lopuses.

They also realized that this was the last opportunity for them to survive.

Bang!

The wagon fortress on the north clashed hardly against the orcs.

At first, the fortress seemed to defend well and protect the place.

But as the thousand or more orcs kept pushing in, it started to get pushed back little by little.

“Damn! Fall back!”

“Regroup with your allies on the sides!”

“Fall back!”

In the end, a retreating order came out of the mouths of the soldiers.

And Kurk didn’t miss that chance.

He led the advance party and the orc warriors and looked for the blind parts of the fortress.

In the end.

Bang!

The wagon fortress fell.

The line that got pierced through.

Kurk and the warriors kicked the lopuses with expressions filled with cheer.

They wanted to get out of this hell like plain as fast as possible.

Dudududu.

Violin’s troop entered Riten forest along the steps shaking the ground.

Silence fell on the plains in an instant.

To the point you wouldn’t be able to believe that a fierce battle happened here.

“Whew!”

The soldiers let out a long breath.

A somewhat relieved expression.

It wasn’t an expression someone that could annihilate their enemy should have.

Then, Roan got on a wagon and looked at the orcs entering Riten forest.

A faint smile appeared on his face.

“Flee…..I’m sorry, it’s too late.”

A firm voice.

“You already fell in my trap.”

The real trap wasn’t on the gorge nor on the plains, it was in the forest.

Roan raised his spear highly and yelled.

“Block Riten forest with the wagons and buckets!”

The soldiers all looked at Roan.

They knew.

That everything that happened until now was happening according to Roan’s plans and guesses.

Respect and fear appeared in their eyes.

Roan pretended not to notice that and continued saying.

“It’s becoming time to finish this battle!”

Chapter 45




“Kurk! Untie me! Right now!”

Violin continued to yell while struggling.

Kurk didn’t react at all as if he had become deaf.

‘I’m sorry.’

He let out a sigh and looked backwards.

‘They really are chasing us.’

The spearmen were chasing them while yelling.

‘Even so it’s impossible to catch up to us who are riding lopuses.’

Different than the horses, the lopuses didn’t lose that much mobility in the forest.

‘Now that I look, I can’t see the enemy’s cavalry?’

It was a weird thing.

‘Are they maybe ambushing us in the forest?’

But in the end he shook his head.

If it was a normal commander, he wouldn’t do such things as hiding the cavalry to launch an ambush.

‘The important thing right now isn’t that.’

Kurk threw away the complicated thoughts in his head.

‘Sons of bitches. I will certainly pay you back for today.’

He ground his teeth and kicked the lopus.

He could see the exit of Riten forest from far away.

The white light between the trees seemed like the door to heaven.

A faint smile appeared on his face.

‘If we just get out the…….’

Then, Kurk’s face stiffened.

Because an amazing path of fire surged from the entrance of the forest.

‘Flames?!’

Kurk looked at his surroundings with a really nervous expression.

Fortunately, there were no more places that were set on fire.

‘Damn. So they are blocking our escape route?’

They lacked oil to set the entire forest on fire.

But even so, it wasn’t that the fire stayed still.

It was obvious that the fire would spread to the insides of the forest through the west wind.

“Sir adjutant Kurk!”

All the orcs stopped and looked at Kurk.

Kurk’s eyes rolled quickly.

‘We charge through like this? No. Charging through the path of fire is impossible.’

The flames were burning fiercely with the help of the wind.

‘The south is blocked with the gorge, and the humans are attacking us from the east. The place that’s left is…….’

His sight goes to the north.

Sleion river.

‘Although the riverside is a bit narrow…….’

Even so, it wasn’t so narrow for them to not be able to move.

‘We follow the riverside and retreat to the west.’

It was a much safer route than charging through the flames.

Kurk pointed to the north.

“We will follow Sleion river and retreat to the west!”

“Yes! Understood!”

The orcs replied in one voice and pulled the reins.

The lopuses turned to head towards the north and started to run.

Kurk looked at the red flames and clicked his tongue.

‘We completely fell. We completely fell by the hands of the human bastards.’

He ground his teeth.

‘Everything hadwould have been a plan and strategy since we discovered the humans in the entrance of Riten forest.’

They just reacted and moved towards the places the humans wanted them to go into their trap.

‘Damn.’

Anger surged up.

‘I will certainly pay you back for what happened today.’

Kurk ground his teeth and glared his front.

It was difficult to see clearly because of the white smoke.

‘Anyways, it doesn’t seem like they are setting the forest on fire any more.’

It seemed like the humans couldn’t plan up to this point.

Then, the orcs that were in the front got out of the forest and arrived at the narrow riverside.

Flash!

The smoke disappeared and a beautiful scene was spread outspread.

The golden side and the flashing blue river.

The green plains that extends beyond Sleion river.

Everything was beautiful.

Except for one thing.

‘Thi, this…….’

Expressions as if they couldn’t believe this at all.

“How can this be!”

Kurk couldn’t hold it anymore and yelled.

He looked at the front and the rear alternating with a stiffened face.

The human cavalry were taking place on the west and the east with Violin’s troop at the center.

‘Damn! Just how far are you seeing things through!’

Kurk was curious as to what the man that set up this perfect trap looked like.

He didn’t know that Roan was responsible for this strategy.

Meanwhile Gale, who was leading the cavalry, glared at the orcs and put on an ill smile.

‘Everything is like Roan’s plans.’

In the first place, Roan thought up a strategy to massacre the orcs that got out of the forest by using flames with the wagon fortress.

But there were two big problems in the flame strategy.

The first one was that they really lacked oil.

The second was that the west wind continued to blow without stop.

In the end, Roan had to pluck and fix the strategy to make it perfect.

‘I send Violin’s troop to the gorge by showing them soldiers spreading oil on purpose. After that, we push them to Riten forest with wagon fortresses.’

Because of that, Violin’s troop get to enter Riten forest with a west direction and face the opposite blowing wind.

‘Even if I don’t have that much oil, the fire can cover the orcs with the help of the wind.’

Actually, the orc troop didn’t have any choice.a right for choices.

The place that they could run off to escape the fire was only to the north, where the Sleion river was located.

When the orc troop gets tired by the continuous attacks, they attack them with the cavalry they hid until now. they would attack them with the cavalry they’ve hidden until now.

This was Roan’s ultimate strategy.

And for this, Roan sent the order to Gale and the cavalry to wait on Sleion’s riverside.

‘He certainly said that they would flee towards here.’

And those words became true.

Gale looked at the orcs with fixed eyes.

‘It’s became time to end the battle.’

He raised his right hand highly.

“Attack!”

A loud yell.

“Waaaaaaaa!”

“Kill them!”

“Don’t let even one of them escape!”

The cavalrymen started to charge forward with a fierce intent along with the yell that shook the earth.

“Kuk! Damn it!”

Kurk ground his teeth.

He had nowhere else to escape to.

The fire was being eaten by the flames, and in front of their eyes the Sleion river was flowing calmly.

On top of that, the lopuses were also tired.

“Damn!”

He cursed out and cut off the rope that tied up Violin.

“Go.”

“What?”

Violin frowned at Kurk’s words.

Kurk gave her his lopus and yelled.

“We are going to die here. If it’s already been decided……”

His eyes got filled with madness.

“Take revenge for Sir Sedek.”

At those words Violin bit her lower lip with strength.

Kurk yelled once more.

“Go! We will block them here!”

Violin looked at Kurk’s two eyes fixedly.

And then, she hardly gripped the reins and nodded.

“Let’s meet in hell.”

At those words Kurk burst out in laughter.

“I will be waiting for you first.”

A farewell.

Violin quickly kicked the lopus.

Her eyes were already tainted with madness.

Now, there was no need to hold onto the rope of sanity.

Kuong!

The lopus let out a cry and started to run towards the forest.

“Huh?!”

“Huh!”

Gale and the cavalrymen looked at her with surprised looks.

“Catch her!”

“Get her!”

At Gale’s and the adjutants orders, the soldiers grabbed the reins.

Then, Kurk and the other orcs blocked their front.

“We can’t send you!”

“Where do you want to go!”

They were already determined to die.

In the end, the cavalry ended up losing Violin.

“Kuak!”

“Kek!”

The yells of the orcs that were on the side were heard continuously.

Kurk looked at the spears flying towards him and then closed his eyes.

‘A warrior thinks that dying in the battlefield is glorious.’

Stab.

“Kuk.”

A sharp spear stabbed in his chest.

Gale looked at Riten forest and let out a sigh.

‘Did we miss the most important troop commander?’

Looking at the situation, it seemed like she went to find Roan.

‘In the end, it seems like Roan has to end this battle.’

This battle was really a battle based on Roan.

Gale’s sight followed Violin’s back who couldn’t even be seen.

‘Nothing has to happen.’

Riten forest was filled with white smoke because of the fire.

A situation where it was difficult to look in front.

‘I don’t know why but it feels comfortable.’

He tasted bitterness in his mouth.

An uneasy feeling flowed back his spine.

*****

‘This much is enough.’

Roan looked at the forest that was half gulped down by the flames in an instant and let out a long sigh.

The orcs fled to the riverside just like he had thought.

‘They would get massacred in the ambush.’

If they meet with the cavalry Gale was leading, everything would get solved.

From Flam mountain gorge, to the wagon fortress and buckets, and finally the flame attack in Riten forest and the ambushing cavalry.

The orcs went through many things in a short while.

‘They will be out of their mind.’

Roan’s corner of his mouth slightly raised. The corner of Roan’s mouth slightly rasied.

He clapped and yelled with all his strength.

“Now! Everyone, we are falling back to outside the forest!”

The orcs had already charged to a deep part of the forest.

There was no need to chase their back anymore.

On top of that, the smoke was filling the forest entirely.

“Yes! Understood!”

The soldiers replied in a loud voice and moved quickly.

Because their eyes and nose hurt because of the white smoke.

“Cough. Cough. It seems like sir adjutant is fine. I’m almost dying.”

Lander looked at Roan while fanning with his hands.

Roan just put a faint smile instead of replying.

‘It’s all because of Kalian’s tear and Brent’s ring.’

Actually, the part of his eyes not hurting and not feeling any heat were things he had already expected.

But he didn’t know that he would be fine after breathing in smoke.

It certainly smelled like smoke, but his nose and mouth weren’t uncomfortable or hurt.

‘The abilities Brent’s ring has may be more various than what I thought.’

On top of that, the white forest that was filling the forest couldn’t obstruct Roan’s sight.

It wasn’t that he could see clearly, but even so he could see more clearly than normal people.

‘Searching for each ability that Kalian’s tear and Brent’s ring haves will also be fun.’

Roan smiled brightly and touched his ring.

He, and the 12th squad protected the forest until the end.

They were looking thoroughly for any orc that got left behind.

“It seems like they all retreated.”

Austin approached while fanning with his hand.

Roan nodded.

“Good. Then we are also getting out of the forest.”

At those words, Lander smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

“It’s so regrettable that we lost Violin, that crazy orc bitch. This battle that was planned by sir adjutant Roan from start to end will end up in the hands of another person.”

“I don’t care much.”

Roan shrugged his shoulders.

Lander, that looked that, clenched his fists tightly.

“If you don’t want to, at least I can…..”

“Stop talking. Please. What are you going to do after you catch Violin?”

Austin frowned and rebuked.

At those words, Lander hit his armor.

“I want to place an adjutant badge on my armor after catching that bitch. Only then will you, vice squad commander, not be able to say anything to me.”

“What?”

Austin raised his hand as if he was going to hit him at any moment.

Lander acted as if he got really frightened by that and started to run in front.

Roan looked at that and smiled.

‘Even so, it’s fortunate that everyone is safe.’

On a battlefield where tens of people, and thousands of people died, no one from the 12th squad died.died from the 12th squad.

They did receive big and small wounds, but they keptwere still keeping their lives.

‘Now that it became like this, I would like it if I can stay with everyone until the end.’

Roan looked at the back of the squad members and took in a deep breath.

That was because he knew really well that it would be difficult.

Then, Lander who was walking in front, looked at his surroundings and yelled.

“Where are you everyone? Come, come quickly please.”

Meanwhile, the smoke got denser and it became difficult to differentiate what was in front of you.

Roan looked back.

Tadak. Tadadak.

The sound of the flames eating up the trees was heard.

Every now and againonce and then, white and black smoke surged up.

‘Huh?’

Then, a really small and displeasing sound was heard.

‘A sound that shakes the ground……’

He quickly turned his head towards the place the sound was heard.

At that instant, Roan’s two eyes became round.

“Violin!”

He could see Violin running through between the smoke.

“Yes? That was sir adjutant right now, right? You said Violin? Just because I made a joke right now, even you are…..”

When Lander talked up to then.

The white smoke got pushed.

Roan looked at the scattering smoke fixedly.

The whole world’s movement became slow.

Spaaat!

The lopus that charged through the smoke really slowly.

And Violin that was swinging the blade on top of the lopus.

Roan opened his eyes abruptly and yelled.

“Lander! Dodge!”

The loud yell rang throughout the forest.

Lander, who was looking around looking for Roan, lowered his body with a surprised look.

Slash!

The blade that pierced through the smoke instantly cut off Lander’s neck.

“No!”

Lander’s face was chopped off in front ofgot hardly stabbed in Roan’s two eyes.

The head that fell to the ground really slowly.

The light in his eyes still didn’t go off.

Roan raised his spear and ran towards Lander.

“Wha, what happened?!”

“Sir adjutant?”

The 12th squad members, that had it difficult to look at the front, shook their hands and followed Roan’s back.

“Lander!”

Roan cried out while holding Lander’s head.

“Uaaaaaaaaaaa!”

Chapter 46




The sound that rang throughout the forest.

For Roan the 12th squad had a special meaning.

The first squad he got to command since he returned to the past.

Because of that, each and every person was too precious.

“Violin! I won’t leave you alive!”

Roan stood up.

The other squad members also arrived late.

“Lander!”

“Ah……..”

“Ho, how could this……..”

They were speechless at the miserable sight.

The ones that had a weak heart like Keep and Glenn were already shedding tears.

Roan carefully gave Lander’s head to Austin.

“Austin. Retreat along with the squad members.”

At those words, Austin got a hold of himself.

“What are you going to do?”

Roan replied shortly and charged forward.

“I will cut the neck of Violin for Lander’s sake.”

His sight followed Violin who was hidden in the white smoke.

She had lost her direction because of the smoke that blocked her sight and was moving towards the fire path.

It seemed like she didn’t even know who she had slain.

‘Dog like bitch! I will offer your head to Lander.’

Roan hid himself in the smoke like that.

“You can’t! We are already near the fire. It’s dangerous!”

“Sir adjutant! It’s dangerous!”

The 12th squad called out Roan late and tried to stop him.

But they couldn’t hear Roan’s voice anymore.

“Damn!”

Austin kicked the ground.

As he couldn’t see well, he couldn’t move as he wished.

In the end he could only follow Roan’s order.

He looked at Lander’s corpse that was on the ground.

“Ah……”

A low exclamation came out from between his lips.

It’s been 8 years since they roamed the battlefield together.

In that time, many comrades died.

But it was the first time he felt this heavy.

“Stupid bastard.”

Austin kneeled in front of Lander’s corpse.

“What kind of crazy bastard yells like that on a battlefield. Huh? Who shouts like that!”

He hit Lander’s chest and cried.

“You bastard! You said you wanted to wear the adjutant badge! That you wanted to shut me up after you became one!”

Austin couldn’t hold it and in the end, tears came out.

“Kugh.”

“Kuk.”

The other squad members also ground their teeth and their eyes reddened.

Pierce, who usually lacked a way to express his emotions, wiped off his tears and mumbled.

“Damn. Because of the smoke……… Kuk.”

But he couldn’t hide the crying sound that came out from his voice.

“Uhhhhhhhh.”

“Kuhhhh.”

Keep and Glenn couldn’t hold it anymore and started to cry loudly.

They remembered the sight of Lander who liked to smile and talk.

After this battle ends, let’s have a proper squad meal.

The words he spoke before going to battle.

Pierce forcefully gulped down the tears and shook his head.

“What fun is a meal without Lander……”

Sorrow denser than smoke filled the forest.

Today, they didn’t lose a comrade, but a piece of their hearts.

*****

Tadadak. Tadak.

The sound of the fire eating the trees was clear.

A red flame.

In the middle of that, there was Violin.

“Only now can I see well.”

She looked in front of her and smiled ill-naturedly.

As she ran while evading the white smoke, she was soon in the middle of the fire.

Maybe it was because of the fire, but the smoke that covered her eyes became faintly dispersed.

“I will have to cut off your neck.”

The owner of the cold voice was Roan.

He slowly breathed out and calmed himself down.

“The one that died right now was your underling?”

“Lander. That was his name.”

Roan spoke coldly and bit his lips.

Violin smiled faintly and nodded.

“As I couldn’t see in front, I cut off the neck of the one that talked loudly. I wondered what would I do if it was you. Because you don’t die that easily.”

She pointed at the fire spreading because of the wind.

“Isn’t this the best place to die together?”

Violin thought up of the death of her husband again and was filled with madness once more.

“Together? It’s certain that you are a crazy bitch.”

Roan pointed at Violin with his spear.

The fire gulped down the trees at the sides and shook.

Even so, Roan and Violin didn’t react at all.

‘Once again, i’m seeing the effects of Brent ring.’

Thanks to one of the ring’s abilities, that was temperature regulation, he felt warm even when he was in the middle of a fire path.

‘But of course, it’s not that my skin is fine.’

Brent’s ring only regulated your temperature, it didn’t block the heat entirely.

If the fire became fiercer than now, there was a high possibility that he would get burnt.

In the other side, Violin couldn’t feel the heat because of the madness.

In one sentence, she became really crazy

“Kuk! I will kill you first and follow you back.”

Srung.

Violin laughed strangely and unsheathed her blade.

Tadadak. Tadadak.

For a while, only the sound of burning trees was heard.

Swuk.

Then, a spark flew between Roan and Violin.

The spark was precisely in between their sights.

Tat!

The two of them charged forward just like they had agreed beforehand.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The final battle started in the fire along the sound of metal clashing.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh!”

Roan’s and Violin’s attacks continued without stopping.

Once the battle started, the surrounding fire didn’t affect them at all.

The two only focused on each other.

They lightly ignored the spark that fell on their armour.

Spat!

Violin’s blade slightly cut off Roan’s shoulder.

‘She’s a monster.’

Roan looked at Violin and ground his teeth.

Her body was shining in red because of the attack she suffered from Pierce.

She had lost a lot of blood.

But even so, her movements were no different from usual.

No, rather it seemed like her movements were faster and stronger.

When he was facing her, he got the feeling that she resembled a mad warrior.

‘I can’t get pushed like this.’

Roan quickly turned around and stabbed with his spear.

“Hmph!”

Violin snorted and swung her blade.

Then, the spear moved faintly like it was dancing, and it’s trajectory changed.

“Kuk!”

Violin ground her teeth and pulled her blade back, but it was too late.

Stab.

The spear pierced her left shoulder.

“Kugh!”

However it wasn’t a complete success.

Violin grabbed the spear with her left hand.

Roan stabbed the spear with all of his strength, but it didn’t move an inch.

Violin’s strength was that amazing.

Even after that, Violin’s and Roan’s attacks continued without even one inch of concession.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The sound of metal clashing without stopping.

Kugung. Boom.

The trees that fell without being able to hold the fire.

The heat of the battle became hotter with many meanings.

“Die!”

“Die!”

The blade and spear swung with all their strengths.

Cheng!

Sparks flashed along with the sound of metal.

Tat!

In the end Roan and Violin distanced themselves.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

Roan was almost out of breath.

His shoulders, chest, abdomen and thighs were filled with big and small holes.

“Haa. Haa.”

Violin was also exhausted.

It had also been a while since the madness that made her forget her nature disappear.

On top of that, her injuries were worse than Roan’s.

You could see many deep wounds.

They exchanged sights.

‘Let’s end this now.’

‘This is the last one.’

Even if they didn’t say anything, they understood each other.

Boom. Boooom.

The flames were already near them.

Even if they wanted to keep fighting, they couldn’t.

Roan and Violin took in a deep breath and charged forward.

Spat!

Roan’s spear sliced Violin’s shoulder.

“Kukh.”

Violin’s movements were also dull as she was exhausted.

She just confronted him and swung her blade.

Roan ground his teeth and twisted his body.

Slash.

The old armor got cut off cleanly.

Not only that, but his clothes and flesh also got cut quite deeply.

‘Kugh.’

Roan ground his teeth.

It wasn’t to the point where he couldn’t endure it.

He turned around quickly and swung his spear.

Violin pulled the blade without even showing that she wanted to dodge and blocked the spear.

Cheng!

The spear used the rebound and spun to the other side.

‘Let’s end it with this.’

Roan was planning to execute the 7th stance of Pierce’s spearmanship, no, Roan’s spearmanship.

It was the strongest one amongst the ones he could execute in his current state.

‘Hph!’

He took in a deep breath.

Muscles on both of his arms swelled up.

Spat!

The spear head cut through the wind.

The body of the spear widely shook to the sides.

‘Damn!’

Violin looked at the spear that moved gorgeously to the point it made her dizzy and bit her lips.

Because the spear swayed too widely, she couldn’t be certain if it was aiming for her right or for her left.

“Uaaahap!”

Violin cried out loudly and swung her blade.

THen.

Tung!

The spear hit the air with a heavy sound as if it got bounced off.

The spear evaded the blade and cut into her left side.

‘Kuk!’

A movement she hadn’t expected at all.

Violin twisted her body all she could and swung her blade.

But the movement of the spear was much faster than what she expected.

Stab.

The blade of the spear got stabbed into her side.

‘It has ended.’

Roan felt the heavy feeling transmitted to the end of his hands and let out a long sigh.

Then Violin swung her blade widely and cut off the spear.

Stab.

The strong spear got cut off cleanly.

‘Damn!’

Roan fell back and had a surprised expression.

‘When we battled on the plains, a crack appeared on the body of the spear.’

The part where it was a bit broken when it faced against the blade.

Violin looked for that place and broke it in two in an instant.

“Kuk.”

She grabbed the spear stabbed in her side and staggered.

It must certainly feel nasty and painful, but there was a smile on her face.

“It seems like I won this battle. You are empty handed but I have my blade.”

Violin swung her blade.

Roan threw the short body of the spear and shook his head.

“I wonder. We have yet to see that.”

He brought his hand to his waist.

He touched the long steel stick with the tip of his hands.

‘Travias spear.’

The spear he couldn’t use in the Pedian’s plain battle because he didn’t have mana.

But in this situation, this was the only weapon he could use.

Violin looked at that and sneered.

“Kuk! You will fight with that small piece of metal?”

She shook her head and moved towards Roan.

“Let’s go to hell together with me.”

Violin bit her lower lips tightly and swung her blade.

As she still had the spear stabbed in her side, her movements were really slow and unnatural.

Swush.

Roan barely dodged her blade and stabbed his Travias spear towards her neck.

“Hmph!”

Violin snorted and grabbed the piece of metal with her left hand.

Roan tried to pierce more with all his strength but it didn’t move at all.

“Do you think you will be able to kill me with this metal stick?”

The tip of the metal stick touched Violin’s chin.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“If it’s this much, I can kill you plentily.”

“What?”

Violin frowned.

Just how could this piece of metal, where the end was blunt, be able to kill her!

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“Grab there tightly.”

“What did you say?”

At the words she didn’t know the meaning of, Violin frowned.

Then, Roan twisted his wrist and turned the tip of the stick hard.

Kigigi.

A displeasing sound.

The end of the spear criss crossed and turned to the sides with the sound of oxidized metal turning.

“Huh?”

Violin opened her eyes roundly at the stick in her hands that was changing.

“Greet Sedek for me.”

Roan’s farewell.

At the same time.

Click.

The tip of the spear separated with the sound of sawtooths went in gear.

Cheeng.

A sharp blade surged up along with a clear sound of metal.

Stab.

The blade passed through Violin’s chin and pierced her head.

“Grrrrrr.”

The expression of Violin as if she couldn’t believe it.

She fell to the ground.

“Whew…….”

Roan also let out a long sigh and staggered for a moment.

The feeling of all his strength leaving his body.

‘She was a strong opponent.’

She was one of the strongest opponents he had faced until now.

‘I have to quickly learn mana.’

If he didn’t do so, situations where he will have it hard with only an orc commander will keep repeating.

Tadadadak. Boom. Kung.

Then, the surrounding trees fell because of the flames.

‘I will have to get out of here for now.’

Roan pulled out the Travias spear and cut off Violin’s head.

She still had her eyes open.

‘I will offer your head to Lander.’

Roan ground his teeth.

At the same time, he moved his steps while looking at the burning flames.

Kugugugung.

Then, on the place he left, trees started to fall and flames took its place.

*****

The battle ended in a complete victory.

Violin’s troop got annihilated, and the losses of rose troop and blackbird’s troop were minimal.

However on the faces of Gale, the adjutants and the soldiers happiness couldn’t be seen for their victory.

They all looked at Riten forest with anxious looks.

Boom. Kugung.

The trees falling because of the fire.

And the amazing smoke that is continued by that.

“Ah……”

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

“Please, you have to be safe………”

They were still waiting for Roan who couldn’t get out of the forest until now.

Now, Riten forest was completely enveloped by flames.

Then, Pierce walked to the front.

“I can’t hold it anymore. I will go in.”

At those words Austin put a surprised expression and grabbed him.

“What are you doing!”

“Then are you telling me to just stand still and watch! I will go in and bring sir adjutant Roan!”

Pierce’s yell.

At those words the 12th squad ground their teeth.

“Won’t it be fine if we pour water on ourselves?”

“We will also go in.”

The members of the 12th squad were taking the lead on each other by saying that they would get inside the fire.

At that look Gale, the adjutants and the other soldiers let out a low exclamation.

‘The comradeship of the 12th squad is amazing.’

‘He has good subordinates.’

Then, Austin that was stopping the others, pointed at Riten forest.

“Huh?!”

A really surprised expression.

Everyone turned their heads and looked at Riten forest.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out from the mouth of everyone.

The place where their sights gathered.

The youth they longed for that much showed himself in front of the entrance.

The youth who was releasing hot steam while being covered in blood was Roan.

“Sir adjutant Roan!”

“Sir!”

The squad members all ran towards Roan.

Roan raised Violin’s head towards them.

“I bought a gift for Lander.”

He looked hopeless, but he still had strength in his voice.

The squad members looked like they would cry at any moment.

They didn’t say anymore.

They just hugged themselves with the heat.

Chapter 47




“Miss. He’s amazing, right?”

A good looking middle aged woman smiled brightly and asked.

“What’s amazing? The orc troop must have been stupid.”

From the other side a fine voice was heard.

The owner of the voice was a woman in her early twenties.

White skin, quite large facial features, and long black hair. It was quite a cute lady.

Only, her face was filled with playfulness so she gave a childish aura.

Then, a heavy and a low voice was heard.

“No. Jane’s right. This Slan battle was really amazing.”

The man that was seated next to the young woman was also a handsome man in his early twenties.

At those words, the middle aged woman and Jane widely opened their eyes.

“Right? It’s true that our 7th corps soldiers are amazing. Sir Owells.”

“I told you to just call me Walter.”

“Yes? Yes. Mister Walter.”

Jane hesitated and nodded.

Walter Owells was a noble and she was no different than a commoner.

Because of that it was still awkward to call him by his name and not his surname.

“Are the soldiers of our 7th corps really that amazing?”

The young woman leaned her head on Walter’s shoulder.

Walter slightly pinched her cheek as if it was cute.

“Mary. I have never seen the strategy used in Slan region anywhere else. They made a fortress by utilizing wagons and barrels? It’s a strategy I can’t imagine at all.”

“Ah…….”

At those words the young woman, Mary smiled merrily and buried her face on Walter’s chest.

A really happy look.

She was Mary Tate, the daughter of Aaron Tate.

‘Walter is praising our 7th corps.’

She felt proud.

“As it’s something said by the strongest and most intelligent person, I can believe in you right?”

“Of course.”

Jane butted in.

“Hmhm.”

Walter cleared his throat as if it was embarrassing.

However, pride showed on his face which he couldn’t hide.

“Anyways, I want to meet the person that thought of that strategy. And…..”

Walter gulped the last words.

‘I also want to meet the soldier that slew the crazy female Orc warrior Violin.’

Something hot was felt deep in his chest.

Competitiveness.

He too, was a man.

“That’s why we are going to the battlefield.”

Mary pouted her lips.

Before she entered Slen region, she met with the messenger Aaron had sent.

Because of that they waited for 4 days in the nearest castle until the battle ended.

And right two days before, she heard the notices that the battle had ended by travelers and merchants.

No, it wasn’t a notice of the battle simply having ended.

They told them the stories and the actions of the 7th corps in a detailed fashion.

The marvelous strategy and of course an outstanding commanding and strong military.

There wasn’t one thing that wasn’t amazing.

‘I still can’t forget Walter’s surprised expression from back then.’

A proud feeling for nothing.

Actually, she was feeling a guilty conscience from Walter.

She was from the outer areas of the kingdom, from the eastern boundaries, and also didn’t have any family or reputation to show.

Compared to her, Walter’s father was a really powerful influential person as he was the leader of the knights of the count.

Outstanding looks and amazing skills, on top of that a family whose future seemed really bright.

Walter was more outstanding than Mary in every aspect..

‘That Walter got surprised by the activities of our 7th corps.’

Her lips continued to raise.

A feeling she wanted to give a kiss to the one that thought of the strategy and the one who slew Violin right now if only they were in front of her.

Then, Walter’s voice was heard.

“It was a nonsense favor, but thanks for listening to it.”

At those words Mary shook her head.

“No. If Walter wants to see it, we have to go whatever happens.”

Walter, who heard of the stories from the merchants and travellers, begged Mary to let him meet the soldiers of the 7th corps.

Mary nodded immediately as she felt she could do something for Walter.

It wasn’t important if it was possible or impossible.

She just wanted to listen to Walter’s favor.

In the eyes of Mary, who was looking at Walter, love completely filled it.

Jane looked at that and smiled.

‘The lady also grew up.’

It has already been 20 years since she has been with Mary.

She had never parted ways with Mary from when she was born until she became 20 years old.

‘You certainly have to grab mister Walter.’

Jane slightly looked at Walter.

A really clear appearance and look.

Most of all, his mouth and thick chin that seemed to have rostrum made him look more manly.

‘His family is good, his looks are also good, and as he’s a pupil from the head of Pavor academy his abilities also are good…… There’s no one better for our lady Mary.’

On top of that, Walter also treated Mary really well.

It was also him that told her to go and congratulate Aaron’s birthday first.

‘There are some times where his competitiveness get excessive, but if he’s a man it’s a point he certainly needs.’

If he was someone that would become big in the future, he needed that temperament.

‘Perhaps, he would be able to enter the royal knights. If he does……..’

Mary would also be able to leave this outer region and go to the capital of Miller which they had only dreamt of.

‘On top of that, the two of them really suit each other.’

Jane and Mary looked at Walter alternatingly and shut their mouths.

Then, the direction of the carriage turned a little along the cry of the horse.

Johnson, who was driving the carriage, yelled in a loud voice.

“I see the troop’s camp!”

At those words, the three people gathered in the window.

They could see the tents that were spread far away on the plains.

It was the camp of Rose troop and BlackBird troop.

In that instant, Walter felt his heart beating wildly.

‘Are we arriving soon?’

Over there was the soldier that thought of that amazing strategy and the one that slew Violin’s head.

‘I will learn what I have to…….’

A smile appeared on his shut mouth.

‘I will battle with him if I can.’

Deep in his heart, competitiveness boiled.

*****

Although the battle preparations had only lasted for 4 days, the battle itself didn’t last for more than a day.

Even so, the soldiers were completely exhausted.

They wanted to say down and sleep like that, but there were still many things they had to do.

First, they had to catch the fire of Riten forest and gather the corpses of the orcs in one place.

And of course, they also carefully gathered the corpses of their fallen allies.

They also filled up the traps on the plains and repaired the wagons and barrels or made new ones.

Because they couldn’t make the farmers of this region suffer through this battle.

Because of that, the soldiers that could move had to sweat like crazy.

And that was the same for the 12th squad.

Even so, because of Gale’s consideration, they got to take care of organizing the goods of the camp.

“Now! Pile it up properly. Properly.”

“Move this over there.”

“Give me that.”

The members of the 12th squad and some other squads moved busily and piled up the remaining food and equipment in one place.

Then, Keep stealthily left the place.

But even without Kalian’s tear, Austin caught up with the lazy guy like a ghost.

“Hey! Keep! Where are you going!”

At those words Keep flinched and grabbed his waist.

“I’m going to pee.”

“Tch! Go quickly!”

At Austin’s words, Keep nodded and moved his feet.

Only after he got out of the camp did he loosen his belt.

“Uo. How refreshing.”

Keep closed his eyes and trembled, and then frowned.

‘What’s this sound?’

It was a really small but familiar sound.

He roughly adjusted his pants and moved towards the plain.

Then, he saw the carriage that was moving quickly.

“Carriage?”

For a carriage to appear in a zone where a battle had just ended.

Keep rubbed his fingers on his thighs and ran inside the camp.

“Vice squad commander.”

“What is it?”

Austin, that was distributing the goods, asked back with a tired expression.

Keep said in a voice so low, it seemed like he was whispering.

“A carriage is approaching.”

“Carriage?”

Words he had never thought of.

Austin put down the food bag he was carrying and moved to the entrance of the camp.

Keep quickly followed his back.

The soldiers on the entrance had already raised the fences and put on a vigilant posture.

Austin looked at the carriage coming quickly towards the entrance and frowned.

‘Why a carriage so suddenly………’

While he was thinking this and that the carriage already got close to the entrance.

“Huh? That flag…….”

As the carriage got closer they could see the small flag stuck on the roof.

A really familiar flag.

Keep, that was looking next to him, frowned.

“Isn’t that baron Tate’s symbol? The symbol of corps commander Aaron Tate.”

“It is. I’m certain.”

Austin nodded.

It was impossible that they didn’t know of the family symbol as a soldier of the 7th corps.

“Perhaps, corps commander?”

At Keep’s words Austin shook his head.

‘Corps commander enjoys riding a horse rather than a carriage. On top of that, there’s no way only one carriage would move when the commander himself is travelling.’

Then, only one thing remains.

‘It means that someone from the Tate family is riding it…..’

Whoever it was, it was a situation difficult to understand it.

‘Is there a reason for the lady or the madam to come?’

However he rolled his read he couldn’t find an apparent reason.

Meanwhile, the carriage stopped in front of the entrance.

Purrrrr.

The carriage stopped along the burbling of the horse.

Austin and Keep looked at the door of the carriage with quite nervous expressions.

Kiig.

The door opened along with a wooden sound.

The first one that appeared was Jane.

She stood in front of the door with a humble posture.

Next to that, Walter showed himself.

He smiled faintly and looked at the entrance of the camp.

‘The attitudes and the eyes of the guards are good.’

He felt that all the rumours about the battle were true.

Then, Mary showed herself through the door of the carriage.

Walter quickly grabbed Mary’s hand and gently escorted her.

A really elegant and beautiful movement.

Austin and Keep, who were looking without a word opened their eyes widely.

‘Lady!’

It’s lady Mary!’

Baron Tate’s daughter appeared in their camp.

A really uneasy feeling as if something would already happen.

Then, Mary smiled brightly and approached.

“Pleased to meet you. Do you know who am I?”

“Yes. Milady.”

Austin and Keep bent down.

Mary smiled even more brightly and shook her hands.

“I came to meet Uncle Rose.”

“U, Uncle Rose……:”

Their processing ability stopped for a moment.

Mary pouted her lips as if they didn’t even know that.

“The troop commander here. I’m talking about Mister Gale.”

“Ah! Troop commander.”

Austin and Keep understood it only then and nodded.

Behind them, a low voice was heard.

“What’s going on?”

The owner of the voice was Roan.

While he was distributing the goods inside the camp, he discovered the carriage and had come over.

He had taken off his upper clothes and got covered in bandages to get treatment for the wounds he got in the chest by Violin.

On top of that, as he vaguely washed himself, the water still didn’t dry off.

Because of the endless training, practice and the battles his body was quite built up and the skin had a pleasing colour to look at.

Because he trained with the best training methods available 20 years from now on, the bones and muscles took their place well and because of that he beacame a bit taller and his body’s balance became better.

In short words, a really well made body the moment you saw it, it would make you speechless.

On top of that, the hair that was messy and the water drops that dripped from it emanated a wild charm.

‘He’s cool.’

Even Austin and Keep were hanging with their mouths open.

And that was the same for Walter and Mary.

‘It’s a feeling he overwhelms people.’

Walter’s thoughts.

‘Wh, what is it? He’s wild but at the same time he feels really sad.’

Mary’s thoughts.

‘My god. How cool!’

The last one was Jane’s thoughts.

Roan was really exhausted in mind and body because of Violin’s battle and Lander’s death.

And that also emanated a really strange atmosphere.

Sadness and malaise.

‘It feels like he’s bearing all the weight in the world.’

Mary’s eyes shone.

But she didn’t know.

That Roan was just exhausted and his eyes were giving in.

Roan passed Austin and Keep and stood in front of Mary and Walter.

“I’m class 5 adjutant from Rose troop. What happened?”

Only then did Mary get a hold of herself and smiled.

“I’m Mary Tate. I came to meet Uncle Gale.”

“Ah…..”

Roan slowly bent down.

‘So this person is the daughter of Commander Aaron.’

He thought he now knew the reason Aaron treasured her so much.

‘She looks cute.’

He made hand signs to the guards.

Srr.

The wooden fences blocking the entrance were taken off.

“I will lead you.”

At Roan’s words Mary nodded.

“Please.”

A clear and gentle voice.

Roan slightly nodded and started to walk one step in front of them.

Behind him Walter, Mary and Jane followed.

As soon as they got inside the camp all the soldiers put down their things and gathered as soon as they saw a woman.

“Huh? It’s the lady.”

“It’s Lady Mary.”

“What is she doing here?”

Everyone recognized Mary and shook their hands or bent down.

Walter, who was walking behind, looked at that and smiled.

‘It seems like she’s popular between the soldiers.’

It meant that she didn’t have a bad temperament.

‘I certainly picked a good person.’

While Walter was thinking like that, Roan who was walking in front stopped walking.

At the same time a thick voice was heard.

“Lady!”

The middle aged man that comes smiling brightly.

It was Gale, who Mary referred to as uncle.

“Uncle!”

Mary also smiled brightly and shook her hand.

The two people grabbed their hands and said hello for quite a while.

After a while, Mary pointed at Walter late.

“Here is Walter, Walter Owells.”

“I’m troop commander Gale of rose troop from the 7th corps.”

Gale bent down deeply.

As he had seen Mary since she was a newborn he could talk with her without hesitation, but it was different in the case of Walter.

In front of status, age and rank didn’t matter at all.

“I’m Walter Owells.”

Walter was also skillful in acting disrespectful.

After the short introductions ended, Gale looked at Mary.

“But why did you come here?”

“Ah……”

At those words Mary looked at Walter for a moment and replied in a low voice.

“They say there’s someone who planned a really amazing strategy in Slen battle. I want to meet that person. Who is it? Is it perhaps Uncle Rose? Or the black bird uncle? Or perhaps one of the adjutants?”

She was referring to troop commander Jefferson when she said black bird uncle.

Mary didn’t even breath and after she finished her sentence she looked at Gale’s two eyes fixedly.

Eyes implying to answer immediately.

Gale smiled brightly and replied.

“If it’s that guy you have already met him.”

At those words Mary and Walter had surprised expressions.

“Huh? We met him?”

“Yes.”

Gale replied shortly and pointed at Roan who was still next to them.

“This friend here is the one that planned the strategy.”

Boom.

In that moment, Mary’s and Walter’s eyes became big.

They had expressions as if someone had hit the back of their heads.

“I’m class 5 adjutant Roan from rose troop.”

In the other side Roan bent down with a calm expression.

‘This is the person that thought of that amazing and marvelous strategy?’

Mary looked at Roan’s face fixedly.

However she looked he didn’t look like he used his head.

‘Oh right! There was one more.’

Mary calmed herself down and looked at Gale again.

“There’s someone else I want to meet.”

“Tell me.”

“They say there’s a soldier that slew that crazy female or warrior Violin. Where’s that person?”

Gale smiled brightly again and replied.

“You also have already met that person.”

“Huh? We also already met that person?”

Mary put a surprised expression and looked around.

It was when Walter also looked at his surroundings.

Gale placed his hand on Roan’s shoulders.

“This friend here is the one that slew the head of Violin.”

Boom.

Once again their eyes became big.

No, this time it was even more so.

They were all hanging their mouths open unconsciously.

In the other side Roan nodded with a calm expression again.

“I’m class 5 adjutant Roan from rose troop.”

Chapter 48




“Uoo.”

Mary let out a weird noise.

She looked at Roan as if it was difficult to believe.

And Walter was also the same.

‘That the one that thought up of the strategy and the one that slew Violin’s neck were the same person?’

She hadn’t heard that rumour.

As the battle had ended not too long ago, the detailed and precise information was missing.

Roan smiled at the gazes falling upon him.

He looked at Gale and shrugged his shoulders.

‘From now on, things like this will happen a lot.’

Gale laughed it off with that kind of meaning.

Roan turned to look at Walter and Mary again.

He couldn’t speak as he wished so he only looked at their faces alternatingly.

After a while, Walter got ahold of himself and extended his hand.

“It’s Walter Owells.”

Roan grabbed his hand and bowed.

“It’s Roan.”

Only then did the greetings start.

“Mary.”

Mary also got ahold of herself.

But on her face, a surprised look still remained.

‘It’s somewhat unexpected.’

There was a personage she had thought of when she heard the rumours.

‘I thought that the man that thought up of the strategy would have a long beard and was a middle aged uncle, and the one that slew Violin had a big body and looked like a mountain thief.’

The guesses of the two people were wrong.

No, in the first place she hadn’t even expected that they would be the same person.

Then, Gale’s voice was heard.

“Let’s not keep standing like this and go inside.”

“Huh? Yeah. Right.”

Mary couldn’t take her sight off from Roan even while nodding.

And Walter was also the same.

No, Jane who was at the back was also the same.

‘He’s a really good looking youth.’

But of course, only Jane was thinking of different things.

*****

Gale lead Mary, Walter and Jane to his tent.

And of course Roan too, who was the objective of their visit, was with them.

As soon as Walter sat down he started to pour questions onto Roan.

“First, shall we talk about the strategies implemented in the Slen battle?”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan talked about the flow of the battle, the strategies he used and the countermeasures for when things turned out the way he hadn’t expected.

Walter nodded with a serious face or exclaimed, but he always showed an honest reaction.

“So you are saying that you had taken countermeasures for when they got out of the forest?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

“Mmm.”

Walter touched his chin for a moment and fell into his thoughts.

After a while, he looked at Roan and said with a careful attitude.

“But you know. I know that your strategy is outstanding, but I have some doubts about it.”

“I will listen to them.”

“First, that region uses Riten forest as the main moving route rather than Flam mountain gorge, right?”

“That’s right.”

“Then, if you hadn’t taken oil barrels, Violin’s troop would have passed the forest. Then what about stationing the wagon fortresses you made on the east of Riten forest and made it so they couldn’t get out?”

Walter looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“You did say that you lacked oil, but I think that if you only lit the west entrance of the forest it would have been enough to cover them.”

Roan shut his mouth and didn’t talk without permission.

Walter smiled faintly and made hand signs.

“It’s fine so tell me what you think about it.”

At those words Roan said in a voice as if he was whispering.

“It’s a strategy that can be thought over plentily. Only, it’s not a big forest to be able to carry 2000 warriors. Following by that, to give Violin’s troop a big blow we have to light the forest on fire the same moment they get inside of it. Because of that, we should have poured oil in the western part of the forest before hand.”

A clear voice and with strength.

Roan continued saying.

“But the oil we had was really cheap and of bad quality. Because of that, the smell was really bad. If we had poured oil on the west entrance of the forest it was obvious that the lopuses would stop by smelling the oil. And actually, the lopuses showed a big reaction to the oil barrels in this battle.”

Lopuses were monsters similar to dogs or wolves rather than horses.

They were quite sensitive on smell.

“Ah…..”

Walter let out a low exclamation.

Certainly, if it were lopuses they would be able to detect the smell of the cheap oil.

Walter hit the end of the table with his finger.

“That’s right. I was short minded. I’m learning one more thing like this.”

A quick and honest admitting.

Roan was surprised.

‘Was there a noble like this?’

He had heard that he was a disciple of the knight chief of Pavor academy and his house was also good.

On top of that, his looks were obviously good and his temperament was also good.

‘I obviously know about Owells family, but why can’t I remember anything about Walter?’

If he was a person like this, he would remember him with whatever he did, but in Roan’s memories there was no such name of Walter Owells.

And there would be two cases for it.

‘He lived a meaningless life…..’

Roan turned to look at Walter.

‘He died early on even before his abilities could bloom.’

Even so, when he looked at Walter right now, there was a high probability for the latter one being the case.

‘Thinking about it, there would be countless geniuses that died without me knowing…….’

Excluding the ones that succeeded big way, there may also be geniuses that died before they could bloom.

‘Aside of the geniuses I know from the past, I have to also find the hidden ones.’

It was important to use the memories of the future, but it was also important to build a new future with his own effort.

When he thought up to that point, Walter’s voice was heard.

“And one more thing. About the traps in front of the wagon fortress.”

“Yes. We dug into the ground and filled it with sand and water.”

“Yeah, that. If it was to the point you precisely guessed the location they would pass to, wouldn’t putting sharp pieces of metal or spears have been more effective than sand or water? What do you think?”

At those words, Roan put a surprised expression instead of replying.

And then he smiled bitterly.

“I couldn’t think of that. I did think that I should tie down the legs of the lopuses, but I couldn’t think about damaging them with the trap itself.”

He lowered his head.

“This time i’m learning big way.”

“Really? This time I was a step ahead? Hahaha.”

Walter became happy and laughed loudly.

Gale and Mary’s faces, who were looking next to them, changed in a strange way.

‘I do know about Roan’s abilities well, but Mister Walter is also amazing at such a young age.’

Gale’s thoughts.

But Mary’s thoughts were really different.

‘Is this something to be that happy about?’

She couldn’t understand anything about strategy or the things they talked about.

‘If this happens you do this, and if that do that. Is this that funny? Even so……’

Mary looked at Walter’s side.

‘If Walter likes it, I also like it.’

Her mouth raised by itself.

Roan and Walter kept talking about strategy and tactics for a long while even after that.

It was to the point that Gale, who had roamed the battlefield for tens of years, got tired.

Walter clapped.

Clap.

“Today’s conversation was really useful. I learned this and that and realized many things.”

“I also learned many things.”

Roan bowed.

Walter looked at that Roan and put on a regretful voice.

“Actually. When the conversation ended I wanted to battle you. I wanted to taste the abilities of the one who slew Violin’s neck myself. But…..”

He pointed at Roan’s chest.

Bandages covering the deep wound.

“I can’t fight with a wounded person. That’s why.”

Walter took off the small badge he had on his clothes.

“If you completely heal, come and find me to Pavor academy. Let’s test our abilities then.”

He couldn’t completely subdue his competitiveness.

Mary, who was next to him, put on a surprised face.

“They give that badge to each of the disciples in a class. Can you give it just like that to anyone?”

At those words Walter shook his head.

“It’s not to anyone, and it’s not giving it away like that. I’m giving it courteously to someone that has the skills.”

He extended the badge towards Roan.

Roan looked Walter’s eyes for a moment and then grabbed the badge.

“I will be going later.”

“I will be waiting for you.”

Walter smiled brightly and stood up.

He shook his hand towards Gale.

“I’m sorry for coming so abruptly when you would still be busy.”

Gale just smiled instead of replying.

Mary stood up and blinked.

“You are finished now?”

“Yes. I’m finished.”

“Then we can go, right?”

“Yeah.”

At those words, a blooming smile appeared on Mary’s face.

The stories about strategies and tactics were too boring.

Then, Gale’s voice was heard.

“Shall I escort you to Ipen castle?”

At those words Mary rejoiced.

“Really? Good for me. Even if you didn’t, I…..”

Then, Walter butted in.

“No. It’s fine.”

He shook his hand and looked at Gale and Roan alternatingly.

“You still haven’t finished cleaning up. I can’t take off forces as I wish.”

Really, looks that fitted a disciple of a head chief knight.

Gale slightly bowed.

“Thank you for your consideration.”

At the coming and going conversation, Mary pouted.

“Only I feel like a spoiled kid. I also don’t need any guards.”

She sticked her tongue to Gale and got out of the tent with Jane.

Walter looked at that and smirked, and then moved his feet.

Gale, Roan and the other adjutants followed them back and saw them off.

Mary glanced at Walter before leaving and said in a voice only Gale and Roan could hear.

“Rose uncle. And Roan.”

A sweet voice.

“You have done well. And thank you.”

She winked and got in the carriage.

Walter shrugged his shoulder as if implying what happened, but Gale and Roan didn’t say anything.

Walter smacked his lips as if he couldn’t do anything about it and got in the carriage with Jane.

Hiiiiing

The carriage started to move along the cry of the horse.

Gale, Roan and the adjutants protected the entrance until the carriage couldn’t be seen anymore.

“Whew. Even so, it ended without anything happening.”

Gale’s voice that was a bit relieved.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“Anyways, it seems that you will slowly get more famous seeing that rumours about Slen battle already spread.”

Roan only smiled at Gale’s words.

“Like this, won’t the count come to find you?”

He said something comical and hit Roan’s shoulder.

Then, Roan slightly bowed and said in a low voice.

“Troop commander Gale.”

“Huh? You have something to say?”

“Yes.”

A short reply.

Gale tilted his head and asked back.

“What is it?”

At those words Roan took in a breath with difficulty and said.

“I would like to have a temporary retirement.”

*****

“You really are returning, right?”

Gale asked again even when he knew he shouldn’t.

“Of course.”

Roan had repeated this answer tens of times.

The two people were standing in front of the 7th corps, Aaron’s office.

Gale sighed.

‘When I first heard that he was temporarily retiring, my heart sunk down.’

Because of that, even when he was a troop commander he grabbed Roan in front of the soldiers and made a fuss.

‘Well, although the fuss the 12th squad made was even more amazing.’

They grabbed Roan’s legs and said that they could never let him go.

Even Chris sided with the squad members before leaving to Miller.

Roan had to convince the squad members for 4 days that he would return after he finished what he had to do.

Only after he said that tens, hundreds of time did the 12th squad barely accept Roan’s retirement.

Gale also confirmed that he would return and even made a promise, and only then did he send the retirement application to Aaron.

‘Has it been 7 times that he returned it?’

Aaron returned the retirement applications being sent.

And when they sent the 8th one, Aaron’s reply came back.

Come to the corps headquarters.

Gale and Roan looked at the tightly closed door of the office.

“Shall we go in?”

At those words Roan nodded.

Kiiig.

The huge wooden door opened along with a creaking sound.

As they got inside the office, Aaron who was checking everywhere, turned his head and looked at Roan.

A stiff expression and unusual eyes.

He approached Roan.

‘Ugh. Is he angry?’

Gale, who was next to him, fell to the sides.

Meanwhile Aaron, who reached in front of Roan, said with a really stiff face.

“You really are returning, right?”

Roan replied once more the answer he had said to Gale and the 12th squad.

“Of course.”

Chapter 49




Sponsored chapter!

“Good. Fine then.”

Aaron unexpectedly seemed to consent to it.

He turned back and walked towards his table and then he stopped and turned to look at Roan again.

“You really are returning, right?”

The same question.

Roan just nodded instead of replying.

Aaron let out a long sigh and went towards his table.

He spread the vacation petition and raised pen.

‘If I sign it now Roan will leave.’

Aaron bit his lower lip.

He wasn’t a staff officer nor a troop commander.

A mere class 5 adjutant was asking for a vacation.

And the reason for it was also clear.

‘A relative that is south of the kingdom passed away…..’

On top of that, it was a normal case where soldiers that were above the class of adjutant asked for a vacation.

It was different in each cases, but a spearman could at most take 1 year off.

Even so, it didn’t matter much for the corps as they wouldn’t be getting their salary.

Even so, he couldn’t sign it easily.

He could change his mind and decide to retire right away, and most of all what he hated to think the most was that Roan got transferred to another corps.

But of course, it wasn’t that common.

As they had their own relationships within the troops, they couldn’t just take a member of another troop as they wished.

‘But if it’s a troop that’s on a higher class than us, it will be different.’

An upper class troop would even be able to blackmail Roan. No, even in a middle class or a lower class troop, they could utilize a method to newly recruit a retired one.

Whatever it was, Aaron was worried about Roan disappearing from him.

‘Most of all, the western region is noisy because of rumours about Roan.’

Half a month had already passed since Slen battle had ended.

After the battlefield got cleaned up, the soldiers that returned from blackbird troop and rose troop kept talking about Roan’s prowesses.

And even if they didn’t do so, it seemed like a rumour about a soldier that used an amazing strategy and at the same time slew Violin spread through travellers.

Meanwhile, the rumours that were vaguely roaming spread properly through the confirmation of the soldiers.

‘He got out of my pocket quicker than I thought.’

He didn’t think that he would be able to hide a fang in his pocket forever.

But at least, he wanted to take him to his side even a little more certainly, before it got out.

‘I couldn’t even get the reply of viscount Reil Baker…….’

Aaron took in a deep breath.

‘Right. If he only returns, it may be better to be out of this region.’

Now that it turned out like this, it wouldn’t be bad to create some distance with the people interested in him.

Scribble.

The tip of the pen moved over the paper.

Aaron finished the signing and let out a long sigh.

And then looked at Roan’s two eyes fixedly.

“Are you reall…… No. How long do you think it will take until you return?”

The southern part was far.

It was almost the exact opposite of this place to Ipen castle.

There was no way it would be short.

At those words Roan replied without hesitation.

“If i’m quick one month, and if I get delayed three months.”

Aaron nodded.

“Don’t forget that a promise for a soldier is more important than their own lives.”

“Yes. I will remember it.”

Roan smiled brightly and bowed.

Aaron moved his feet and stood in front of Roan.

He lent him the retirement permission and hit his shoulder.

“Have a safe trip. And certainly return.”

“Yes. Thank you.”

Roan bowed.

Aaron returned once more to his seat.

“Ah! And I have some more presents to give you.”

“Presents?”

As Roan asked back Aaron nodded.

“Yes. But the preparations still aren’t finished. If you come back later, I will give it to you then.”

“Understood.”

Roan didn’t ask further on and bowed.

Aaron looked at the scroll in Roan’s hand and shook his hand.

“You can get out.”

Even if he tried not to show it, he put on a rather unwilling expression.

Gale and Roan saluted shortly and got out of the office.

Aaron, who got left alone, looked a bit more at the pieces of paper and pushed them to the side of the table.

“Whew.”

He let out a long sigh.

‘I did send him away for now…….’

Now he only had to wait for Roan to return.

He was a man worth the wait.

‘Because even the eldest son of the Owell’s family got amazed.’

Mary and Walter who arrived for his birthday.

The two people, and especially Walter, praised Roan nonstop while they were staying at Ipen castle.

‘If I make Roan mine and Mary grabs Walter……’

A smile appeared on Aaron’s mouth.

‘Just imagining it is fun.’

He buried his body in the chair and closed his eyes.

He wanted to enjoy this happy imagination a little bit longer.

*****

“I told you there’s no need to send me off.”

“No. Until the entrance of the castle. We will escort you until there.”

Many men walked down the street in a pack.

The people that came and went recognized him and waved their arms.

No, precisely speaking, their interest was pouring on the youth walking at the front of them all.

“Huh! Mister Roan! Where are you going?”

“Slen battle was really the best!”

“Take one fruit!”

The youth that receives all of the people’s interest.

He was Roan who was starting the long journey towards the south.

And of course, the 12th squad that followed him.

“Now really go back.”

Roan stood outside of the entrance and waved his arm.

Austin and the other members saluted.

“We will wait here from when the first month starts.”

“If you didn’t return, we will just stay here and become rocks.”

“Have a safe trip!”

Everyone’s eyes were hot and fierce.

‘Don’t worry. I will certainly return. No, I can only do so.’

Roan looked at every faces of the members and moved his feet.

‘If my future is in Potter region, this place has a spring of a foothold.’

He had to return here to Beno castle for various reasons.

Strength started to be put in Roan’s steps.

‘I’m finally going to Potter region.’

One of the first plans that could be picked in one hand after he realized that he returned to the past.

‘But before that……’

He had a place to go.

In the first place, his destination was a bit to the southwest.

As he walked for almost a quarter of a day he saw a small village.

Roan passed the entrance of the village and went to a house located under a big tree.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

“Who are you?”

After he knocked a shabby wooden door, a really slim middle aged woman appeared after a while.

Roan bowed.

“I’m class 5 adjutant of rose troop. I was the commander of your son.”

“Ah….”

The woman let out a low exclamation.

Roan couldn’t even raise his head.

“I couldn’t rescue your son because I lack a lot. I’m really sorry.”

A visit that wasn’t related to his travelling.

The place he came to was Lander’s hometown.

“Sob.”

The woman cried without making any sound and then wiped off the tears with the back of her hand.

“I’m the mother of Lander.”

The end of the sentence trembled.

“Don’t bow like that.”

She covered Roan’s face with both of her hands and raised his head.

“On the last vacation, Lander talked a lot about you. That you were a really amazing man. I was really curious as to who you were, but we get to meet like this.”

Roan couldn’t say anything.

He looked at the woman’s face for a moment and then took out a small bag.

“There’s no way this will comfort you……”

“I don’t need money. I already received a lot.”

The woman turned back the back to Roan and shook her head.

There were tears on her eyes.

“Even so it seems like Lander has been with some really good people. Quite a lot of people came and went from Beno castle.”

“From rose troop?”

“Yes. The troop commander came, and the soldiers of the 12th squad also came saying that they were Lander’s friends. Especially the soldiers of the 12th squad came every time they had the leisure to do so and helped with the farming. They are really thankful people.”

At those words Roan shut his mouth.

‘The reason they nowadays cut off the one night of free day was because of that? They really are nice people.’

He felt thankful towards Gale and the 12th squad.

‘If it’s these people I can be together for life.’

It was good to have good abilities and talent, but he also needed good people and well mannered ones.

Roan grabbed the hands of the woman.

“Lander was a really great soldier and ally. You raised a truly amazing child.”

At those words the woman forcefully smiled.

“As he was recognized by the adjutant he always admired, Lander will also like it. Sob.”

In the end she buried her face in Roan’s hands.

Roan gritted his teeth at the hot tears that were felt on the back of his hand.

‘I have to get stronger. Only then……’

Resolution formed in his eyes.

‘I can rescue at least one more person.’

The tears of the mother that lost her son hit him.

His heart that was a bit scattered at the thought that he was finally going to the south was strengthened.

Today at this moment, Roan felt once again.

That he had many things to do.

*****

Roan started his real trip after he received the really kind treatment of Lander’s mother.

For now, he went to the fishing village Pierr that was located on Poskein lake and had quite some scale.

Poskein lake.

As the biggest lake in the continent, the size of it was a bit smaller than Rinse kingdom.

Rinse, Istel, Dies, Aimas alliances were gathered around the lake as the center.

‘But now they aren’t able to utilize this lake properly.’

Roan looked at the lake that spread without end and shook his head.

‘Now, it’s only used as a place to catch fishes in a small village.’

It wasn’t only in Rinse kingdom, but even the other kingdoms that were at the boundary left it alone.

Because the lake had really big and monsters, which you didn’t know the identity of, which were abundant.

In the end, working as fishermen in the fishing village was everything.

‘But even before 10 years passed, a lot of blood will be shed by the 4 kingdoms to conquer this lake.’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

‘The one that will conquest this lake is the pirate king Bek that’s called, Bright Shark.’

He was originally from the navy of Aimas kingdom, but he made himself independent and became a pirate.

He used outstanding navigation skills and strong fighting power as the background to conquer Poskein lake, and not satisfied with that he attacked many villages and towns and plundered.

‘The navy of the four kingdoms allied themselves later to subjugate it but it was pointless.’

Roan let out a long sigh.

‘I can’t get Poskein lake taken by that violent guy also in this life.’

He planned to dominate Poskein lake faster than anyone.

‘Poskein lake is one of the most important places for my plans.’

But there was a big problem.

‘There’s no proper person.’

Not even one person who was skilled in the navy appeared in Rinse kingdom.

Even the outstanding genius strategist Ian Philips failed to find and appoint a skilled and strong marine.

‘In this life, I will do it myself.’

Roan was planning to do something even Ian had failed.

And his first plan for that was to travel with a ship rather than on the ground.

‘Until now, it will be something no one had tried.’

Getting on a ship and traveling a long distance was something unthinkable yet.

Roan was planning on finding someone that would step up and challenge something that no one had done yet.

For now, he went to the village of Boodoo that was at the south of Pierr village.

Big and small fishing boats and big fishermen were abundant.

Roan carefully asked to the one that looked the most manly.

“Can you get me to Potter region?”

The reply came immediately.

“Don’t say crazy shtuff!” (Not a mistake)

The man turned him down and yelled.

Roan smiled bitterly and looked another person.

But all the fishermen showed the same reaction.

“You crashy?”

“If your not crazy go back to the ground. That’s the safhest place.”

“You will give me a lot of money? Kukuku. This man. If you have that much money why don’t you ride a carriage?”

“Say shit about money a bit more finely.”

Everyone talked sarcastically and shook their head.

In serious cases, there were some that cursed while punching.

“You telling me to die together!”

“You don’t know where a monshter will appear! If you want to die do it alone!”

A loud yell that made his ear numb.

Even so, Roan didn’t give up.

He roamed around Boodoo, the market and the town for 4 days looking for someone that would carry him on their ship.

But even after his persistent effort, no one stepped up.

‘Whew. In the end do I have to go by ground?’

Roan sat at the boundary of Boodoo and looked at the blue lake.

The lake was calm and silent.

Sunlight shone on the lake.

Then a small voice was heard.

“Hey.”

Roan turned his head to where the sound was heard.

The owner of the voice was a youth that seemed to be the same age as him.

Only, his body was so slim he looked really pointy. The youth smiled awkwardly and said.

“About going to Potter region. May I do that?”

At those words, Roan stood up.

“Of course.”

A really excited voice.

At Roan’s reaction, the expression of the youth became a bit dark.

He scratched the back of his head and carefully said.

“But it’s only been a month since I started to sail a ship….. Do you care?”

“Of co…..”

The moment he said that without thinking of anything, he stopped.

‘One month?’

His sight was directed to Poskein lake.

It felt that the calm lake became rough.

Chapter 50




Poskein was the biggest lake in the continent.

It was obvious that you could see the horizon, and when the wind was too strong the waves were also rough.

Daiv, who grew up in Pierr village, followed his fisherman father since little and lived on the lake just like it was his room.

He looked at the horizon that was spread ahead of him and raised a dream.

‘One day I will roam this lake as I wish!’

But even after he became a youth, that dream was still a dream.

‘Money and soldiers. I need a ship that doesn’t break even after meeting a monster and soldiers who can face those monsters.’

But two months ago, his father passed away.

What he left him was an old and shabby house and some wealth.

Daiv spent all of the wealth to repair and remodel the ship.

Because of that, it became a ship that was exaggerating to call a fishing ship.

‘But it’s still lacking.’

The ship he was imagining was completely different to what he had right now.

He needed a lot more money.

‘One day……’

As he was suppressing his dream like that, he discovered Roan, who was looking for a ship in a street of Boodoo, in a market.

‘If I take him to Potter region will he give me a lot of money?’

Quite an interesting story.

He would gain a lot more money than catching fishes at the shore.

For others it would be nonsense, and something they had to put their lives on it, but for him it was an opportunity to realize his dream.

On top of that he had a method to go to Potter region.

‘It’s not that I have to cross the lake.’

Daiv, who finished his thoughts, went to Roan.

“Hey. About going to Potter region. May I do that?”

*****

‘How peculiar.’

Roan looked at the ship he was on and put on a weird smile.

Flangtek ship

The shape of Daiv’s ship was different to what he saw until now.

‘It feels like it’s floating?’

What was fortunate was that the crew seemed quite experienced.

Then, Daiv approached him and said with a voice with strength.

“I only have to take you to Potter region, right?”

“Yes. The faster it is, the better.”

The reason Roan chose to travel by water wasn’t simply just to conquer Poskein lake faster than anyone.

‘I became a bit late because of Slen battle.’

Because of that, his plans of reaching Potter region were late.

‘If I travel by ground, I may not be able to reach there before that accident happens.’

If he wanted to go there by ground he had to take a detour with an arc like direction.

Compared to that, if he was to travel by lake he would be able to at least save 10 days.

Roan didn’t have that much time.

Then, Daiv’s voice was heard.

“I’m planning to move following the shore.”

“Ah…….”

Roan exclaimed lowly.

‘There certainly was a reason he stepped out confidently. But……’

The method to reach Potter region in the shortest time was to cross it.

But this method was too dangerous.

Because the farther they got from the shore, the more monsters there would be.

On the other side, if they followed the shore it was safer on the point of the attacks of the monsters, but it was difficult to sail.

‘As the shore is shallow and the winds are too strong, if he’s not a skillful person there’s a high probability to crash.’

Roan looked at Daiv’s two eyes fixedly.

‘But a person that has only sailed a ship for one month chooses to go by the shore?’

Something difficult to believe.

Roan said his thoughts honestly.

“You sailed a ship for only a month, do you think that will be possible?”

At those words Daiv smiled brightly and shook his head.

“It is indeed one month since I sailed the ship myself, but it’s already my tenth year that I ride one.”

He looked at Roan’s eyes.

“And just because my experience is short, it doesn’t mean that I don’t have the skills.”

An overconfident voice.

“On top of that, I have a secret weapon with me.”

“A secret weapon?”

As Roan asked back, Daiv smiled brightly and pointed his ship.

“This guy is different than the others.”

“Ah……”

Roan exclaimed lowly.

‘That’s why I felt that it was floating, but there really is something different.’

Then, Daiv turned his head and looked at the crew.

“Now! Are you all ready!”

“Yes! Captain! We are all set!”

The crew yelled in one voice.

Daiv stood at the deck and raised his right hand after looking at Pierr village once more.

“Flangtek ship! Sail off!”

“Sail off!”

A loud yell.

At the same time, the shabby ship started to move along with the sound of creaking wood.

Swhooosh.

Then the warm west wind blew.

The wind hit the sail.

Flop!

The sail pushed the ship and it raised.

The ship split the waters and started to move towards the south.

*****

Roan was standing at the stern looking at the Poskein river.

‘Daiv.’

He gathered information about Daiv while sailing.

‘He followed his father since he became 10 and grew up on the ship.’

As his head was bright and his body swift, he did the work of an adult person.

‘The problem was that his thoughts were peculiar.’

The guy that boasted about his great number of fishes caught, started to dream of a peculiar thing.

‘And that is moving on Poskein lake as he wished.’

After Daiv’s father died and left him his ship, he started to act earnestly.

He ripped off the ship and repaired it.

As he couldn’t go somewhere far from the lake immediately, he planned to make a lap following the shore.

Because of that the ship became a really strange and shallow one.

‘Anyways, all of the crew members recognize his brilliance.’

Roan smiled faintly.

‘The courage of not fearing Poskein lake at all, and a dream that others hadn’t thought of. On top of that outstanding skills……..’

He would be a big help in the conquest of his plans.

Roan kept looking at Daiv with interesting eyes.

*****

“Amazing.”

Roan was truly amazed.

He was now looking at Daiv and the crew while standing at the stren.

“Grab the ropes for the sail!”

“Don’t get pushed to the east! It’s dangerous if we get far from the shore!”

“Watchmen, don’t ease your nervousness!”

Daiv certainly wasn’t an ordinary sailor.

Take into account his suitable orders and commanding abilities without flaws, but first his abilities to sail the ship were amazing.

His eye to be able to read the current of the water was good and his abilities to utilize the wind was also outstanding.

‘The words of the crew were true. Daiv is a genius.’

Roan, who didn’t know much about ships, could clearly feel it.

If it wasn’t for Daiv, the ship would have already turned over or crashed.

‘Potter region is already in front of me.’

While following the shore, there were several crises.

The ship could have turned over because of a strong wind, and they could have gotten done in by underwater reefs.

But every time, Daiv overcame it all with at the moment’s wits.

Most of all, the amazing thing was the ship’s performance.

Externally it looked shabby and old, but because of the repairs Daiv did, it showed a greater performance than what he had thought.

Especially, spreading and folding the sail was so comfortable they could dexterously act according to the direction of the strength of the wind.

‘Why couldn’t someone like this show prominence?’

In his past life, there was no one like him.

Roan pondered for a moment and then shook his head.

‘With his temperament, there’s a high chance he challenged the lake early on and died.’

He bit his lower lip.

‘In this life, I will take him to the end. If he doesn’t die early and is able to further his abilities, he’s someone i’m expecting to be able to reach the distance.’

Then, the yell of the watchman was heard.

“I can see Potter region!!”

Roan and Daiv had finally reached Potter region.

“How was it?”

Daiv approached Roan and asked.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“It was more amazing than what I had thought.”

Daiv just smiled.

Roan took out a big bag.

When he got on the ship, he had already paid him.

‘But what is this bag?’

Daiv looked at Roan with a weird expression.

Roan read that and smiled faintly.

“It’s an investment”

“An inversion?”

Daiv still had a weird expression.

Roan continued saying.

“Yes. Mister Daiv. I want to be your patron.”

“To a sailor like me? Just what is the reason……..?”

Roan replied without even a trace of hesitation.

“The reason I want to do it……..”

He paused for a moment and then smiled brightly.

“It’s because there’s a future in Poskein lake.”

“Fu……ture?”

Daiv couldn’t understand and frowned.

Roan added.

“The country that dominates Poskein lake will be able to posses the water bodies of the four kingdoms.”

Strength was put in the voice.

“Probably, the commercial rights utilized in this lake will develop widely in a short time. Incredible amounts of goods will come and go with the 4 kingdoms as the center. And if there is perhaps someone that dominates Poskein lake……”

“He will be able to gain an incredible amount of passing rights. No, is it still lacking? You wouldn’t even be able to sail a ship without permission.”

Daiv continued saying and opened his mouth.

“But what are you going to do after I betray you? And if I act as if I don’t know you even after receiving the investment?”

Quite a provocative question.

But Roan’s expression was still calm.

“I wonder. I will have to think of that by then. If I already start thinking about that…….”

His mouth raised.

“I can’t do anything about it.”

Roan had many things he had to do from now on.

And also had many plans.

Because of that, if he focused too much on a failure there was a big possibility he would be too late or wouldn’t even be able to accomplish it.

‘It’s better to do several things at once taking into account the probability of failure.’

Even if Daiv failed or betrayed him, it didn’t matter.

Anyways, it’s impossible to conquest Poskein lake alone.

Roan was planning to find other sailors, invest in them, and make a big organization.

‘This is no different than the first step.’

The light in his eyes dimmed calmly.

‘I will slowly need a lot of money.’

His head spun quickly.

As he ran a plan, the other one came immediately.

Then, Daiv’s voice was heard.

“Those are good words. That if you have many worries in your head, you won’t be able to do anything.”

He smiled faintly and continued saying.

Meanwhile, the ship reached a small fishing port in Potter region called Tig.

The west wind kept blowing,

*****

Spring was ending and summer approaching, but even if that was the case, it was too hot.

A heat wave raised on the main road.

“Ugh. So hot.”

“Right? It is indeed hot.”

People gathered below a tree that was next to the road.

They kept fanning with their hands without stop.

Then, their sight was directed to the end of the road.

“That person doesn’t seem to be hot at all.”

“He doesn’t even shed a drop of sweat.”

“Is it because he’s young?”

The youth who was walking at the end of the road was walking towards them.

A strong body that couldn’t be hidden with clothes and messy hair.

The identity of the youth that gave a wild feeling was Roan.

He separated with Daiv in Tig village and started to walk towards the south without stop.

‘If it wasn’t because of Brent’s ring I would also be dying because of the heat.’

He touched the ring on his finger and let out a long sigh.

Roan could bear the heat because of Brent’s ring.

“Oy! Youth! The weather is hot, come and rest for a moment! Drink some water!”

The people that were resting in the shade made hand signs towards Roan.

Roan moved towards them and then shook his head.

“I still have a long way to go.”

At those words, the middle aged man with a hawk nose asked.

“Where are you going?”

Roan pointed the south.

“I’m going to Maiel mountain.”

“Mmm.”

At that moment, the people glanced at each other and shook their heads.

The hawk nosed man let out a long sigh.

“Whew. If it isn’t for something important don’t even be around it.”

At those words Roan frowned.

“Did something happen?”

“Right. There is. Yes.”

The hawk nosed man nodded and then said as if he was whispering.

“Nowadays peculiar thing are happening on the mountain. Just like beasts coming down the mountain, or bugs crying like crazy and dying, and even birds hiding themselves.”

“Right.”

Roan’s expression became severe.

“That’s why it will be better to be away of the mountain for now.”

The hawk nosed man put a really preoccupied face.

Roan slightly bowed.

“Thanks for worrying.”

He also put on a worried face just like the other people.

But he was a bit hurried inwardly.

‘It’s already starting.’

Roan looked towards the south.

‘I have to hurry a bit more.’

To the south (4) End

Chapter 51




“The village is too empty.”

“This is all because of Maiel’s mountain. Even so, aren’t we also supposed to be far from it?”

“Ey. Why take it to that? There’s nothing different aside from the beasts having hidden themselves. People will also return soon.”

“Ahem. Well, that’s true. But even so I can’t do anything about feeling like this.”

As two old men conversed, they sighed.

It has already been 15 days since strange things have happened in the mountain.

Meanwhile, most of the villagers momentarily escaped to other regions because of their uneasiness.

Because of that, the only restaurant and bar in the village, called Fran Restaurant, has been empty for a couple of days already.

Then, an unfamiliar stranger appeared from the open door.

It was a youth that emanated a wild aura and had a childish face.

It was Roan.

‘Whew. At least it doesn’t seem like i’m late.’

He put down the bag he was carrying and let out a long sigh.

He would be able to reach his destination before that thing happened because of his constant walking.

He stood in front of the counter and looked for the owner.

One of the old men who was conversing approached.

“You lookin fo’ somethin?” (E/N: I’m pretty sure this is on purpose)

“Yes. Water, bread and dried meat.”

“How much?”

Roan made some calculations and then said.

“Give me a small barrel of water, two days worth of bread, and ten for the dried meat.”

“Wait a moment.”

The old man folded his fingers and then went into the inner part of the kitchen.

After a while, the old man came out while holding some things.

Roan put the additional luggage in his big bag.

“You travellin?”

The man that was looking at the sides asked.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“Yes. I’m checking what’s happening on the south.”

“Working so hard when it’s this hot. But…..”

The old man said in a whispering voice.

“If you can, avoid going to Maiel mountain. Some strange things has been happening over there….. Ahem. Anyways, take care.”

“Thank you for worrying.”

Roan bowed deeply and grabbed his bag again.

The heavy feeling was felt on all of his shoulders.

‘With this much the food will be enough……Now, should I go to the mountain?’

After he greeted the old men, he got out of the restaurant.

The sun shone down strongly, but because of Brent’s ring he didn’t feel the heat at all.

‘The place I remember needs to be exact.’

Roan searched through his memories and continued walking.

The memory of a person was a really scary thing.

You wouldn’t know if you didn’t remember at all, but thinking that he remembered clearly could be gravely mistaken.

‘If my memories are wrong……..’

Aside from not being able to get what he wanted, he may lose his life.

But this was one of the most important things that was in his plans.

‘The fire monarch Reid. I must obtain his impaired mana technique.’

*****

Roan set up camp on the entrance of the mountain.

He had left some distance while not being too far either.

He had placed a piece of cloth as the roof and decided to lodge here.

‘Is it already the fourth day since I camped here? It should slowly start……’

Roan chewed on the dried meat and looked towards Maiel mountain.

A mountain where the sound of birds and insects couldn’t be heard.

Because of that, it emanated a gloomy feeling.

‘It should be time for Viscount Potter to send someone to report that Maiel mountain is strange.’

He didn’t remember the exact date, but it was something that had clearly happened in his past life.

‘Now! Maiel mountain, wide grounds. Tremble quickly. Quickly’

He put strength in his eyes.

The speed of chewing the dried meat became faster.

But nothing happened in the mountain.

‘Will today also pass like this?’

Roan looked at the western sky where the sun was already setting, and let out a long sigh.

It was then.

Pruu.

The sunset slightly shook along the skyline.

‘Huh?’

Roan opened his two eyes widely.

The sunset had clearly shaken.

‘No, I’m the one shaking.’

He got down on the floor after he grabbed the ground with his two arms.

Kugugugugugu.

The earth was crying.

And soon, the mountain and the plains trembled like they were dancing.

Kugung. Kugugugung. Kugung.

The rocks that were on the hillside crumbled down and the trees of the forests trembled to the sides and started to fall.

Kugung.

The cloth roof fell and the food rolled onto the ground.

‘It’s here! The earthquake is finally here!’

That thing he wanted to happen that much.

Roan was waiting just for this earthquake.

He looked at Maiel mountain while still lying on the ground.

He could see the landslide sweeping the mountain.

‘My memory isn’t that wrong.’

Fortunately, the landslide fell down, avoiding the place where he was at.

Kugugugung.

The surface of the earth started to split with a weird sound.

Some places surged up, and some sunk down, and holes appeared.

What was fortunate was that the holes weren’t deep enough to put him in danger.

Roan still glared at Maiel mountain while on the ground.

‘One day for the earthquake to end and for the aftershock to come. Meanwhile, I have to locate the cave where the sleeping fire monarch is.’

After the landslide happened because of the earthquake, the hidden caves will appear.

And in that place, there is the mana technique of the sleeping fire monarch, Reid.

‘After the aftershock happens, rocks will cover that place. Because of that, one of the two volumes for the mana technique ends up being destroyed.’

Roan bit his lower lip tightly.

‘In my past life, Viscount Potter obtained quite a fine first volume………’

He suffered an attack from Duke Voisa, who got the news before he could learn it or he got taken by the kingdom, and lost his life.

‘And Duke Voisa gave that mana technique to his son. Although it had only half the volume, that guy…….’

He became one of the strongest guys in Rinse kingdom.

‘The problem was that he betrayed the kingdom and he escaped to Estia Empire.’

Roan ground his teeth.

Because he remembered the fierce and cruel war that happened because of him.

‘Anyways, it’s a clear truth that he became incredibly strong just with half of the volume.’

Flames appeared in his eyes.

‘But today, I’m not getting only half of it, but the complete technique.’

His chest beat.

His eyes were fixed on a mountain hillside.

‘There, or there. Somewhere should be the fire monarch.’

Kugugugung.

Maiel mountain trembled roughly just like it was making the last movements.

A weird sound was spread far away through the wind.

And that was just like the sound of announcing a historical fomentation.

As soon as the earthquake stopped, Roan started to climb the mountain.

His face was filled with confidence.

‘For now, everything I remembered is correct.’

As a result, there was a high probability for the location of the cave to be the same as his memories.

‘Right. There’s no way it’s wrong.’

The scandal that shook not only Rinse kingdom, but the entire continent.

The scandal that made Estia Kingdom, which was the homeland of the fire monarch, increases Rinse kingdom’s status as its first enemy country.

It was something impossible for Roan, who was a soldier of Rinse Kingdom.

‘It certainly was discovered at the southwestern part.’

Roan searched through his memories and searched many hillsides.

His hands, clothes, face and hair became a mess with dirt.

Because of the shape of the ground, it wasn’t even easy to walk.

“Whew.”

Even so, Roan didn’t rest.

No, he rather moved even quicker.

Those tenacious steps crossed the mountain.

And finally, it was when he reached a valley after he passed a big rock.

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

There was a cave on a cliff in the valley.

‘It’s there. I’m certain it is.’

Roan instinctively knew.

Although it was a scene that wasn’t in his memories, his entire body reacted strongly.

‘There’s the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid.’

Roan started to climb the valley with a half absent minded face.

He jumped off and dirt and rocks fell over his head, but he never stopped.

And finally he arrived in front of the cave in the Potter region that he longed for so much.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and moved inside the cave.

His heart was beating fast and his ears went numb.

A mana technique he hadn’t even thought of learning in his past life.

But in this life he would be able to learn the mana technique of one of the strongest person in the world titledthe fire monarch Reid.

That chance was right in front of him.

Footsteps filled the entire cave.

How long had he walked?

Roan, who was walking with strength, abruptly stopped.

A skeleton was sitting at a side of the cave while leaning on it.

‘Fire monarch Reid.’

It was certainly him.

Between the torn and disintegrated clothes, three books with a red cover were in it.

Everything had dust and dirt covering it, but only the three books maintained a perfect state.

‘Why is it three books?’

Reid mana technique was certainly a book divided in two volumes.

The truth of a third volume existing was something that wasn’t in his memories.

Roan slowly approached and carefully grabbed the books.

The big letters engraved in the red cover sharply pierced his eyes.

Flamdor mana technique.

This was the mana technique the fire monarch used.

And it was certainly composed of two volumes.

‘Then this…….’

Roan looked at the third and final book.

Reid’s art of fighting. (It says boxing, but a bit weird for the time)

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out.

‘There was also the art of fighting of the monarch in this place.’

He had a thought.

‘Would the soldiers of Viscount Potter also have discovered this book in my past life? Or did it also get destroyed along the second volume?’

He couldn’t know the answer.

But even until the day Roan died, no one that mastered the monarch’s art of fighting appeared.

‘In the end, did this also get buried in the ground?’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘Anyways, it will become of great help to me.’

A harvest he hadn’t expected.

He calmed down his excited heart and stored away the three books in his bag.

‘Is this the real start?’

Roan tightly bit his lower lip.

From now on it was time to experience things he hadn’t in his past life.

‘Mana training.’

He took in a deep breath.

‘But now I have to leave the mountain before the soldiers of the viscount come.’

But he wasn’t planning to move far away.

He was planning to study the mana technique in a secluded place.

No, precisely speaking.

‘It would be feeling the mana.’

Roan hit his chest.

‘If Reid was the fire monarch…….’

His mouth rose.

‘Am I the fire spear king?’

But then, he shook his head.

His eyes shone.

‘Fire monarch.’

Roan clenched his teeth.

‘I will become the fire monarch.’

Then, he saw the laid down skeleton of Reid.

‘Ah! When the aftershock ends tomorrow, the soldiers of Viscount Potter will come to investigate.’

Then, a really bad thing happens to the skeleton.

The soldiers break it to pieces saying that they would take it away.

‘I can’ let that happen in this life.’

Roan took out the cloth used to make a roof and carefully stored away the skeleton.

He concentrated to see if he had missed any small pieces.

“Huh?”

Then, something grabbed his attention.

A silver semicircle object the size of a nail.

That was below Reid’s right hand.

In the end of the pondering, Roan extended his fingers.

Tuk.

The thing he thought would be hard, was really squishy.

“Ah!”

Roan instinctively yelled with a surprised expression.

Because an incredible chill was felt from the tip of his fingers.

At the same time the semicircle object that was on the ground disappeared like something washed it away.

“Huh?”

Roan looked everywhere for it but he couldn’t find it.

‘It didn’t get absorbed by my finger, right?’

He looked at his finger and then frowned.

Fortunately, there was nothing wrong with his body.

‘I feel weird for nothing.’

He smacked his lips and after searching the cave once more he shook his head.

‘Well, it won’t be anything.’

He erased his uneasiness and then carefully raised the delicately packed skeleton.

Then.

Kurururu.

His feet trembled.

“Huh?”

Roan frowned and looked inside the cave.

‘Aftershock?!’

Something he hadn’t expected at all.

‘Shouldn’t the aftershock start tomorrow?’

The source of the calamity was that he had dropped his guard because everything happened just like memories.

He looked at the entrance of the cave.

Kugugugu.

The tremor and the sound worsened.

Tududuk. Tuduk. Tuk.

Rocks fell on the entrance of the cave.

“No!”

If the entrance got blocked it would be hard to leave.

Roan hurriedly charged forward and threw himself.

However.

Bang! Baaang!

An amazing sound exploded.

At the same time, the open entrance crumbled.

“Ah…….”

Roan stood at the tightly blocked entrance and let out a low exclamation.

His memories of his past life.

Everything was right until now except for one thing.

The time when the aftershock happened.

Because of that he ended up being trapped inside the cave.

Roan’s mouth twisted.

“Damn it!”

He cursed unconsciously.

Mana technique (1) End

Chapter 52




The cave was pitch black but it wasn’t a big problem because he had Kalian’s tear.

Roan kicked and pushed the rocks but they didn’t even flinch.

‘My memories about the aftershock were wrong?’

He sat in the entrance and shook his head while picking up some pebbles.

‘No. The aftershock certainly happens tomorrow.’

Then only one case remained.

That a landslide or the collapse of the mountain he didn’t know of had happened.

‘If my assumption is true, then the aftershock will happen tomorrow and the rocks at the entrance will get cleared. But……..’

By then, soldiers of Viscount Potter would be located at every place on the mountain.

‘They wouldn’t just send out a person that came out of a cave like that.’

If he was unfortunate, not even losing the books would be enough, he would even have his neck cut off to prevent rumours spreading.

“Damn.”

Roan threw away a pebble that he was holding.

He wouldn’t be able to clear the rocks from the entrance like this.

‘I have to find a method to get out.’

That was the way to live.

Roan stood up and moved towards the opposite side of the entrance, to the deeper parts of the cave.

But as it got more narrow, a completely different space appeared.

“It was completely blocked off.”

Roan then returned to the entrance.

He saw the worn cloth that had wrapped Reid’s skeleton.

‘This is all because of you sir. Why are you here from all the many plac……’

Roan, that was grumbling, frowned and tilted his head.

‘Now that I think of it, what’s the reason for the fire monarch to have come all the way here?’

Reid, until his whereabouts became unknown 50 years ago, was a duke of the dominating Estia Empire and the leader of the powerful armed group Flamdor Fighting School.

But what could be the reason that that kind of person came to die in the southern region of Rinse kingdom and in a small and secluded cave that was on a mountain like Maiel mountain?

Roan slowly looked through his memories.

He was searching for Reid’s whereabouts from his countless memories.

And the most convincing rumour of them.

‘He battled against the queen of water Biate 1 and the both of them ended up wounded without gaining anything.’

Biate was also one of the strongest that could be counted on one hand who shook the continent.

Especially because she was the first human, and the strongest messenger, who made a contract with the water spirit king Elaim.

Reid, who used the force of fire, didn’t like Biate who used the force of water at all.

‘Fire and water. They wanted to see who was stronger through the battle.’

But Biate, who distanced herself from battles and wars kept declining the duel request countless times and hid herself.

‘But if the rumours are true…..’

Roan looked at the cave slowly.

‘This cave may somehow be related to miss Biate.’

But there was nothing worth anything here to be called a trace in this small cave.

‘Maybe…..?’

Then, Roan pulled out his bag and took out the three books Reid had left.

‘Wouldn’t he have left something when he died here?’

He carefully spread the first volume of the Flamdor mana book and cautiously checked if there was anything related to Reid’s death.

The sound of pages being flipped through filled the cave.

And when he passed the last one, Roan’s two eyes turned big.

“Ah……”

A low exclamation.

There was something.

The content that Roan was looking for was on the last page.

His eyes moved sideways quickly.

Reid Flamdor. I’m leaving a short word before dying.

He started by announcing that he didn’t have much to live.

I came over here after finding out that the water queen Biate Ellon’s dwelling place was inside Maiel mountain. I requested for a duel but she served me some tea and declined indirectly. In the end I grabbed her, who was trying to wash off her hands first and flee, forcefully and battled her. We fought for four days and four nights inside her dwelling place. We were really angry at each other. I believed that I was the strongest among humans. However while fighting, I have never overwhelmed her even once. In the end I, who was blind because of the competitiveness, used my final weapon which shouldn’t have been used. At that moment, the duel that was looking for who was superior ended up being a life and death one.

His heart beat quickly.

‘The rumours were true!’

The reason the fire monarch Reid and the water Godess Biate who disappeared approximately at the same time 50 years ago was because of their duel, no, because of the life and death battle.

Roan hurriedly checked the following content.

In the end she and I ended up gaining nothing but injuries.

We realized that we didn’t have any possibility in surviving because of the severe wounds.

I wanted to die under the hot sun if I were going to die.

I came out of the dwelling place and came to the cave, but I didn’t have the strength to move anymore.

When I was leaving my last words while looking at the sunlight that shone at the entrance, the water spirit king Ellaim came to look at me.

He may have wanted to take revenge because I made her die.

However Biate forgave me.

She left to Poskein lake along with water spirit king Ellaim.

I didn’t know the exact reason, but it couldn’t have been the same as me…..

The moment I was dying I longed for a hot place, and she would be longing for a deep and wide body of water.

The handwriting became dimmer and shook.

I’m leaving the Flamdor mana technique and Reid battling skills to the one fated to me.

Don’t even think about returning it back to Estia kingdom or to the Flamdor family. Only, if it gets taken by them that is also unavoidable. Because the strength of the fire can only be obtained by the strong ones.

The letter was finally showing its end.

Also, the fated one will be able to get near Biate. But only the fated one.

Roan moved his sight away with the last sentence.

I die after realizing that fire and water aren’t non compatible but, a coexistence.

These were words that he didn’t know the meaning of.

However, the important thing wasn’t the last sentence.

‘This place is the entrance to get inside miss Biate’s dwelling place.’

His sight moved inside.

‘But it means that the tight space is the entrance…….’

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘He said that only the fated one would be able to get in.’

But he didn’t have any relationships with Biate.

But even so, he couldn’t just stand still and waste time.

‘Anyways, there’s a place beyond that wall for me to hide.’

Roan put the book away and held his bag.

And he carefully embraced the cloth with the skeleton.

Step. Step.

Footsteps was heard inside the cave.

Roan stood in front of the wall once more.

‘There has to be some kind of secret device.’

He kept checking the wall up and down, and to the sides.

However he couldn’t see any special traces even after having checked everywhere.

‘Then, next………’

Roan extended his right arm and put it on the top right.

The tips of his fingers moved to the end of the walls.

He wasn’t hurried.

He carefully checked the wall while putting all of his concentration at the tip of his fingers.

Then, Roan’s finger reached in a middle part.

“Ah!”

A surprised voice and expression came out.

Roan moved his hand away from the wall and looked at his finger.

‘I suddenly feel an incredible chill………’

A familiar feeling.

‘Ah! The silver semi-circular object that was on the floo…….’

When he was thinking like that.

A small change occurred on the stone wall.

A silver water drop appeared in the place where he took his fingers off.

“Huh?”

His eyes turned big.

‘This is the same as the silver object from before?’

Roan fixed his sight on the wall.

Pat.

Then, the water drop that surged out took the shape of a wheel.

And after that it started to spin.

Guguguguk.

At the same time, the sound of rock and sand grinding was heard.

“Ah……..”

A low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

The stone wall that was blocked without even having a bit of space, started to open to the sides little by little.

Boom.

An entrance appeared along with a heavy sound.

Roan didn’t hesitate.

He moved inside the door.

Guguguguk.

The stone wall turned to its original place once again and perfectly blocked the cave.

The silver wheel that was spinning once more hid itself in the wall.

A perfect darkness and silence.

Nothing could be felt inside the cave anymore.

******

Roan was half absent-minded.

He couldn’t believe the scene that was spread out in front of him.

A huge space that was spread out in a small cave.

‘Is Maiel mountain completely empty inside?’

To the point he thought that.

However, seeing that mines were being developed in many places, this scene was difficult to understand.

‘Just piercing through a little bit seems like this region would appear.’

Roan tilted his head and then went down the stairs.

‘It certainly is miss Biate’s space, whoever sees it would think this.’

It was to the point he thought Biate? Even when he didn’t have previous information.

In the huge place, water streams were flowing from east to west and north to south, and in the place the two rivers met, there was quite a large pond.

The surprising thing was that on one side of the wall, a huge waterfall was falling.

‘I certainly can’t hear a thing when this much water is splashing.’

It was a feeling that his eyesight and hearing senses turned bad.

Roan evaded the many small and big ponds that were at various places and went to the place where many books were piled up.

A huge table.

And the books that were spread everywhere.

‘So this is the place where miss Biate battled against sir Reid.’

Taking that into account, the place was too neat.

The two of them were the strongest in the continent.

They wouldn’t have fought like normal soldiers.

‘There should also be some secret in here.’

Roan started to thoroughly check the books that were spread around in a sloppy way.

‘Sir Reid also left a letter while dying. Miss Biate wouldn’t have left something like that.’

They were historical figures even when they were alive.

He thought that there would be no way those kind of people left the world without even leaving a last mark.

Especially if it was the beautiful and ladylike Biate that was beautiful to the point she was called as a queen.

His hand, that was moving on the table, stopped.

A shallow book reached his fingers.

……..Leave it to you.

Because of the many books covering it he could only see the last words.

As Roan pulled that book, the other books tumbled down.

‘Certainly!’

Roan put on a faint smile after checking the contents of the book.

It seemed that he had found what he wanted.

Biate Ellon leaves you her last words.

The following content was just like what Reid had left behind.

But the only difference was that it wasn’t Reid, but Biate.

However at the end, a completely different story was written.

The reason I chose this huge empty cave as my dwelling place is because it was the lair of blue dragon Berr. All the space is filled with water energy. Because of that, it also isn’t bad to choose this as my last one.

But even so, I like Poskein lake even more.

There are children that follow me over there.

That’s why i’m thinking of living my last days over there.

To the one who fate has connected us.

For you to have entered here and be reading this means that you realized the essence of water or you absorbed it.

‘Huh? The essence of the water?’

Roan frowned.

He remembered the silver waterdrop that was absorbed by his fingers.

‘That’s the essence of the water? But why was it on the floor?’

He didn’t know.

Roan continued to read through the letter.

I will entrust you the lair of sir Berr. It’s fine to use what’s here however you like. Even so, it would only be useless books and some objects.

If perhaps you really want to climb to the top of the water, come to Poskein lake to find me.

I will leave my last piece over there.

The one that finds that piece will be able to obtain the strength of water and my children.

These were difficult words to understand.

Different than Reid’s words, that were frank and concise, Biate’s words were entirely gentle and significative.

Even so, the last word was quite frank.

Goodbye.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and covered the book.

He sat in the chair and fell into his thoughts.

‘For now I can understand why this place is unbelievably big and strange………’

It has already been 200 years since dragons disappeared.

But the stories about them kept being passed along without missing anything.

And the dragon lair was the same.

A lair was a place humans couldn’t get in as they wished or make a dent with their strength.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘Duke Voisa, who took away the Flamdor mana technique from Viscount Potter couldn’t have not seen the words sir Reid left.’

He slowly started to remember.

“Ah……..”

A low exclamation came out.

“So that’s what happened. I wondered why Duke Voisa was interested in developing Poskein lake………”

A feeling the puzzles in his head fell into place.

‘Duke Voisa would have done everything to try to enter this place. But as he couldn’t enter at all, he must have turned his attention to the lake.’

He thought that Biate would also have left something like Reid while dying.

But even so, if he moved that openly then flies could gather.

‘That’s why he suddenly came out with developing the lake.’

But even so, he wouldn’t have received the results that he wanted.

Rather, because of Duke Voisa’s movements, the other three countries jumped in on the development of the lake competitively.

‘And on that process, the pirate king Beck app……’

When he thought up to that.

Bang.

Roan abruptly stood up.

The chair fell and rolled on the ground but he didn’t care.

He yelled in a loud voice as if he was possessed.

“Beck! So that bastard found the piece of miss Biate!”

Chapter 53




Of course everything was a guess.

But if it was like his guess, everything would fit.

‘The reason the four kingdoms, Rinse kingdom included, jumped in to develop the lake and the reason why Beck, who was originally a marine, could become the pirate king.’

The things that weren’t related to each other fit together like a puzzle.

‘Then, the children miss Biate talked about……..’

Roan had a faint smile.

‘They are the mermaids.’

They were very similar to humans overall, but they had rakes in their toes, their skin was so smooth it seemed transparent, and their eyes were really mysterious.

They had gills behind their ears, so living underwater was possible for this race, and they were staying in a deep part of Poskein lake.

‘It’s not known for now, but after 10 years they appear along with Beck.’

In his past life, Beck and the head of the mermaids were a couple.

Because of that, Roan and other ordinary people thought that the reason Beck received the help of the mermaids was because of that relation.

‘But if he obtained the piece miss Biate left…..’

And if the children Biate was talking about were the mermaids, Beck would have been able to treat them merely as sea creatures because of the artifact Biate had left.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh.

‘But in this life everything changed because of me.’

First, as he had obtained the Flamdor mana technique and Reid’s skeleton, the soldiers of Potter wouldn’t be able to obtain anything.

And also Duke Voisa wouldn’t be able to obtain anything, different to his past life, and the development of the lake wouldn’t happen.

A naval force wouldn’t be created by the Aimas alliance and Beck wouldn’t become a marine.

‘Is this a good thing? Or a bad thing?’

He couldn’t know yet.

However the really certain thing was that only Roan had this information and the pieces of the puzzle in his hand.

‘Is it a monopoly for now?’

His mouth raised slightly.

The Flamdor mana technique, Reid battling skills and continued by the lair of blue dragon Berr and the hidden artifact of Biate.

All these things became his.

“Anyways……”

Roan looked at the tip of his fingers.

The silver waterdrop.

‘Is that really the essence of water?’

He searched on the other books Biate had left but in the end he gave up.

The contents were really varied and there were a lot of books, so finding the information he wanted immediately was close to impossible.

‘I would be able to do it if I do it slowly.’

Anyways, he had to stay here for quite a while.

‘At least one month……

‘

By then the knight and the soldiers of Viscount Potter, who were searching the mountain, would all have gone back.

Roan looked at his bag.

‘By then, let’s learn the Flamdor mana technique.’

He couldn’t waste even a day.

He was planning to train in mana in this place.

But unfortunately, Roan had overlooked about one truth.

That this was the lair of the blue dragon and it was filled with water energy.

*****

Roan thought seriously.

‘Aren’t I a genius?’

The reason he thought like this.

‘I felt mana in only one day.’

He sat and took a posture just like the book told him to and then he breathed and concentrated.

Meaningless repetition of inhaling and exhaling.

Even so, his concentration didn’t scatter.

‘Even Pierce, who was called a genius, took two days to feel mana.’

He threw away the uneasy feeling.

But exactly one day.

Something soft came in along the breath.

‘Mana!’

At the new and surprising feeling, his concentration scattered, and the mana he sensed that was like a thread disappeared instantly.

But he was certain that it was the mana he saw in books or dreams.

Roan took a posture again and sat.

When he repeated breathing twice more.

He once again felt something soft.

But it was only up to there.

‘I certainly can feel mana.’

The energy that flowed through his skin.

The energy that entered his body through the nose and mouth.

He clearly felt the thing called mana.

‘But why doesn’t it pile up on my body?’

But this hateful mana just went sightseeing in his body and fled again to the outside world.

The mana hole that was the size of a fingernail and was in his lower stomach was still empty.

‘Let’s concentrate. Concentrate.’

Roan fixed his posture and continued to pull mana towards his body.

The mana spun around in his chest and abdomen.

But that bastard escaped again to the outside world with the exhaling.

That thing repeated nine times.

“Even if this is wrong it’s seriously wrong…..”

Roan let out a long sigh and shook his head.

There was exhaustion on his face.

He wasn’t tired physically, but mentally.

‘Am I understanding the technique wrong?’

He spread the first volume of the book.

But however times he read and reviewed it, he didn’t find any wrong points.

No, rather, the wrong point was in the mana.

‘I just have to pile up the mana itself inside my body. As I only pile up the separated fire essence……’

Originally, the thing called mana was an energy which all the attributes were gathered together.

On top of that, they were fiercely free and liked to scatter.

Because of that the normal process was that of pulling mana inside your body and accumulating it.

But in the Flamdor technique, in the accumulation process, the fire essence was separated from the mana inside the body, and after separating the other essences the remaining energies went outside the body again.

And only the remaining fire essence was accumulated in the mana hole.

‘Normal mana techniques are different in each situation, but most are non attributed. However the Flamdor technique shows a pure fire attribute to the point it’s an extremity.’

Reid used this mana technique that utilized only one essence to the extreme and became the strongest human.

‘But why can’t I separate the mana? It just feels like there was no fire essence from the start…….’

Roan, who was shaking his head, stopped and opened his eyes widely.

His sight was directed to a side of the wall.

“Ah……”

A low exclamation.

He saw the waterfall falling non stop.

“You stupid.”

Roan hit his dull head once and then shook his head.

‘In the last words miss Biate left it was certainly written. That because this place was the lair of blue dragon Berr, it’s filled with water essence.’

He tried to accumulate fire essence in a place like this.

‘The fire essence in this place would be really scarce.’

When he thought that, there was another thing that worried him.

Roan spread his hand.

‘If the silver waterdrop that got absorbed in my finger is really the essence of water, won’t I have problems in mastering the Flamdor technique?’

However he had never felt any changes in his body or felt weird.

He let out a long sigh.

‘Did I get stuck from the start?’

Even so, he didn’t give up.

‘However much there is the essence of water, there couldn’t not be the essence of fire.’

After training and training the technique he would at least be able to separate a grain sized essence.

Roan opened the spread book and pushed it to the sides.

‘Huh? Now that I see…..’

Then, the thought that passes through his head suddenly.

‘Didn’t mister Reid fight in a place like this with miss Biate and reach a stalemate?’

This place was really filled with water essence.

It was the worst place for Reid, who utilized the essence of fire.

But even so the result was a stalemate.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘Mister Reid was certainly a lot stronger than miss Biate.’

At least in strength.

His affection and interest in the Flamdor mana technique became even bigger.

He fixed his posture and closed his eyes.

‘Let’s concentrate.’

Anyways, he didn’t have anything to do for one month.

Roan slowly took in a breath and pulled mana in his body.

The continued process of separation and accumulation.

But the process was of course a failure.

However he didn’t give up.

And didn’t even falter.

Roan kept concentrating on the technique while seated.

*****

The wide space was sickly quiet.

Roan was seated on a place where water splashed without sound.

He was firmly seated on the ground.

A peaceful face.

His chest and abdomen that heaved up.

It felt just like time had stopped.

Then.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and slowly opened his eyes.

A faint smile appeared.

“Finally success.”

Trembling voice.

‘I finally separated the essence of fire and accumulated it in the mana hole.’

It has been twenty days since he first sensed mana.

Although it was only the size of a grain, he was satisfied.

No, he was shuddering.

‘I, I can also use mana.’

He wanted to stand up immediately and yell.

However Roan pressed down those feelings.

‘I don’t want to let go of this feeling.’

He realized that it was possible to accumulate fire essence in this place filled with water essence.

Roan didn’t want to let go of this feeling of having separated the mana and accumulating fire essence.

He closed his eyes once again.

‘If ten days pass, it becomes one month. It’s time to slowly get out of here.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘If I get outside I will light a fire first. So that it gets filled with fire essence.’

Mana moved inside his body along the inhaling.

He slowly moved the mana inside his body.

Time flowed and kept flowing like that.

*****

Roan stood up and looked at Brent’s ring.

‘Although the mana is the size of a coin……’

Even so, he thought that he would be able to use one of the abilities of the ring that were asleep.

In his face, expectation he couldn’t hide, appeared.

Roan softly clenched his fists and walked to the front.

He injected mana into the ring.

As the mana road was still narrow and the operation was rough it took quite a long time.

Then.

Pat.

Light shined from the ring and after that a ball of light the size of two fists, no, a light marble appeared.

‘So this is light magic. It’s still small and…….’

When he thought up to then.

Pat.

The light marble disappeared without a trace.

At the same time, the coin sized mana in his mana hole also disappeared without a trace.

He spent all his mana on just calling a light marble.

‘I still shouldn’t say that I know how to use mana.’

Roan smiled bitterly and operated the Flamdor mana technique while seated.

The mana that was spent didn’t mean that it disappeared.

The mana that was outside his body would slowly gather to the original place.

Roan utilized the mana technique to gather the mana a little bit faster.

He still had one more thing to do.

After a while, Roan let out a long sigh and stood up.

The coin sized mana was once again filled up.

He grabbed the metal stick on his waist.

‘Travias spear.’

The guy that needed mana to show itself.

‘It will still be difficult to see its real shape…….’

Roan grabbed the stick with his right hand and sent mana to it.

He didn’t twist it like he was washing clothes with both of his hands anymore.

Click.

The sound of gears turning.

Cheeng.

At the same time, a clear sound of metal and a sharp blade surged up.

The stick was entirely sharp, excluding a small part.

Until now, it was what he had seen several times.

Roan kept on inserting his remaining mana.

Chang!

A pleasing sound.

At the same time, the metal stick surged up and the blade started to get a bit longer.

The stick that was originally smaller than the arm of an adult now was similar to a long sword.

Because of that, the part it that seemed like the blade of a sword also seemed like the blade of a spear.

“Ah!”

Then, a low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

The mana had all been spent up.

Chang!

At the same time, the spear returned to its original length.

“Whew.”

Roan sighed with a regrettable face.

‘It certainly is difficult to see the real shape of the spear.’

Travias spear.

According to the amount of mana inserted, the length of the blade and the body and the thickness of it could be controlled as he wished.

On top of that, as it was made with refined gold dinyum by a dragon, the consumption of mana wasn’t that big.

‘Wait a little bit more. I will soon let you smell the battlefield.’

Roan smacked his lips and twisted his hands again.

Cheng.

The blade hid itself and it became a stick again.

Roan placed the spear on his waist and moved towards the desks.

‘Should I get out now?’

It had already been a month since he entered here.

It was time for the knight and the soldiers to return back.

Roan put the books and the skeleton in his bag and chose some gems that were piled up on a place and stored them away.

‘It’s the lair of dragon………’

Just like the words Biate left behind, the amount of the gems or gold wasn’t that much.

At least two bags.

But of course even with that much was something normal people wouldn’t be able to touch their entire lives, but Roan who had to do many big things from now on was really lacking.

Even so, he didn’t feel regret at all.

‘Anyways, I can earn plenty of money through operating mana crystal mines and gem mines.’

Rather, because of this amount, he became able to make an investment in each field a little bit faster.

Roan piled up the remaining objects well and raised his bag.

Anyways, there was no one in this life that knew of this place.

On top of that, even if they did know, they weren’t able to enter as they wished.

‘There’s nowhere safer than here.’

He looked around and then moved towards the entrance.

‘It’s a bit regrettable that I couldn’t identify the silver waterdrop…….’

He had thoroughly searched the books while training, but he couldn’t discover anything related to it.

‘Well, it’s not a problem yet.’

Regardless of his worries, he could also learn the Flamdor technique.

For now he was planning to cover it.

Roan stood in the entrance and took in a long breath.

‘Thank you for the past month. Stay well until I return.’

The place that saved him.

The place he would be born anew.

He couldn’t do anything about the special affection he felt.

Roan looked around for a while and then extended his hand towards the door.

Just like the last time, as he placed his finger in the middle, a chill was felt.

At the same time, the silver waterdrop appeared over the stone wall.

It changed to become a wheel and started to spin.

Guguguguu.

The wall was pushed to the sides along the sound of stone and sand grinding.

Roan moved without hesitation just like before.

Gugugugu.

The stone wall closed back like it had been waiting.

In the place Roan left, a heavy silence fell.

Then, a strange sound that wasn’t heard until now rang out in the place.

Chwaaaa.

And that was the sound of the waterfall.

At the same time, the waterfall that was flowing on the fall, split to the sides.

And from between it, a beautiful lady appeared.

Blue hair, transparent skin that made your eyes hurt.

She, who was wearing a white dress, was barefoot but it didn’t have any meaning.

Because she was floating just like a cloud.

The lady looked at the entrance from where Roan left just now and had a weird expression.

And that was an expression intersecting expectation, sadness and regret.

“For the kid that absorbed my tear to learn the Flamdor mana technique.”

The voice that melts softly.

Around the lady, blue light gathered like a stream of water.

She hesitated for a moment and then went back to the waterfall again.

“Is this a good thing or a bad thing… Oh Biate, I still can’t understand your meaning.”

The lady that called Biate, who was dead for tens of years, like a friend.

Her last words filled the cave that had no one in it.

Chapter 54




Fortunately the mountain was quiet.

As aftershocks kept happening, the soldiers had turned back.

Roan used Kalian’s tear actively and went out of the mountain while avoiding the eyes of people.

He first moved towards the south rather than the north, where the rose troop was.

His objective was a plain that was spread on the boundaries.

‘The hottest place in the kingdom.’

Roan wanted to bury Reid’s skeleton in the hottest place possible.

‘Actually I wanted to bring him to Etna mountain……’

The Etna volcano that overflowed with lava during the four seasons.

However the mountain was located at the southwestern end from even Dies kingdom.

As Roan didn’t have a permit, he couldn’t cross over to another kingdom.

‘Sir Reid. This is the hottest place in the kingdom.’

He thought that being hot was similar to the essence of fire resembling the essence of the sun.

Roan dug into the ground in a place that didn’t have many humans and then placed the skeleton in it.

After he piled up some dirt over it, he placed wood and grass on it.

‘This is everything I can do for you.’

He used a flint and set it on fire.

The dried logs and grass instantly lit on fire.

‘If my understanding in the Flamdor mana technique was deep I would have been able to create fire with just the flick of my fingers.’

Roan looked at the fire and sat down.

He was trying to operate the mana technique in a place other than Biate’s place.

As he started to breathe, the mana started to flow inside his body.

The amount of mana compared to the place of Biate certainly fell behind.

But.

‘Ah……’

An incredible heat covered his body.

‘Hot.’

In the mana spinning in his body, there was abundant fire essence.

An amount of essence that couldn’t be compared until now was separated.

The essence of fire violently flowed following the mana road.

Roan kept breathing and accumulated the essence of fire in his mana hole.

The mana hole that was the size of a coin started to swell up and then it became the size of half a fist.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and slowly opened his eyes.

The fire that was burning had lost strength and was dying.

‘Is it because I absorbed the fire essence?’

Roan smirked and stood up.

He wanted to keep training in the mana by setting all of this place on fire.

However, operating the mana technique in this empty place was quite a dangerous thing.

‘Anyways, it’s certainly more effective than the lair of the blue dragon.’

He was happy and satisfied with just that.

Roan placed some more grass and logs on the dying fire and bowed.

‘I will write a new history with the mana technique and the brawling techniques you had left.’

Roan said his thanks and his last words and then started to move.

The bright flame danced like it was saying it’s farewell.

******

Roan moved towards the north.

But this time, he didn’t use a ship but went by ground.

His objective was the capital of Miller.

‘I have to meet with mister Chris.’

The reason why he was looking for in the middle of returning to the troop.

‘My memories about battles, war, strategies and things related to army of the kingdom are clear but…….’

There weren’t many things he could trust in aside of those things.

Especially, it was all the more so about merchants and commercial rights.

‘About when I died, goldmaster Seil was monopolizing everything.’

Because of that, he didn’t have many memories about merchants.

‘I need a safe information importing in for the future.’

Because of that he had to raise a young merchant and business.

But however he found in his memories, that there was no one suitable for investment.

‘If there’s none in my memories, I will have to find them myself.’

Roan was planning to ask that to Chris.

‘There’s nowhere like Miller with had an abundance of people.’

There would certainly be many young merchants that became discouraged and broken because of the clash with reality.

He had to pick the ones with talent and had a future amongst them.

‘If it’s mister Chris he will be able to do it.’

Chris bit his lower lip.

His steps started to become faster.

Because he walked constantly, he reached to the capital in a shorter time than he thought.

Even in his past life, he had only visited the capital 10 times.

It was a place that wasn’t that related to him.

‘But in this life it’s different.’

To reach a higher place he could only get closer to the capital.

Fortunately, he could pass the inspection at the entrance faster than anyone.

Because he was a class 5 adjutant from the kingdom.

Roan soon went to Lisa street.

The street had Chris told him to come to when he came.

“Now! There are fruits imported from the south!”

“There are medicinal herbs taken from Grein mountain! And also medicinal waters taken from Mas river!”

“There’s good quality paper! And also good quality ink!”

“Look at the wheat of Peidan’s plain!”

Noisy sounds.

There were hundreds of small and big stalls at the sides, with tens of varieties.

‘Certainly, rather than a high class shopping district, there’s a more human smell in Lisa district.’

There was nowhere like this place in Miller.

But of course, this was Roan’s personal taste.

He asked about Chris’s whereabouts to the people that came and went.

‘Oh. He already opened his travel agency.’

Roan was truly happy.

‘I won’t be able to go in empty handed.’

He went to a nearby fruit store.

“Oh! Welcome! What fruit may I give you? Nowadays, the strawberries are really sweet.”

Roan ate one strawberry that the owner gave him and nodded.

“Give me one basket of it.”

“Oh! Thank you!”

The owner placed the strawberries on a wide leaf and started to roll it.

Roan started to walk after he finished his business.

“They said it was around here……”

He stopped walking and looked at the sides.

“Ah……”

A low exclamation came out that instant.

‘However shabby it is, it is too much.’

A really worn out building compared to the others.

He saw a small signboard in front of him.

Chris travel agency.

‘This is the right place.’

Roan fixed his clothes and then opened the door.

“Welcome!”

A loud voice.

A familiar voice was heard.

Chris, who was studying a book in the small place, stood up.

“What may I help…….”

He was greeting him while walking towards Roan and then, he froze when he saw him.

Roan smiled faintly and slightly bowed.

“Hello mister Chris. It’s been a while.”

“Si, sir adjutant Roan?”

Chris fumbled with a surprised expression.

Roan smiled brightly and lent the strawberries he had in his hands.

“Want to eat strawberries together?”

******

Bang!

Rock scraps flew along with a loud noise.

“Sir viscount! I already told you, you can’t break the stone pillars!”

The young soldiers yelled with a surprised expression.

On the other hand, the middle aged man that broke the pillar smiled brightly and lightly swung the spear he had in his hand.

Tung! Tutung! Tung!

The big rocks that were on the ground floated.

Grip.

He put strength in his hands.

Pat!

The spear split the air.

The trace only left was the tail.

Pubuk! Puk! Pubuk!

The rocks that were in the air turned to dust even before they fell to the ground.

Marvelousness.

Just like it implied, it felt like watching the technique of a god. (T/N: Word joke. It can be viewed as Marvelous:god – ness:technique.)

The middle aged man put back his spear and let out a long sigh.

“Good. Finished my morning training!”

At those words, the soldier said displeased words.

“Ah……I’m dead.”

“The steward said he couldn’t break the pillars……”

The middle aged man ignored those words and walked.

He walked with his shoes that were filled with dirt and went towards the office.

“Whew! Certainly, the morning training is the most refreshing!”

The middle aged man wiped off the sweat with his sleeve and put a satisfied smile.

Both of his hands, clothes and shoes were filled with dirt.

However he didn’t care at all.

Rather, he placed his legs over the table that was filled with piles of paper.

Then, the door opened and a middle aged man with clean clothes appeared.

He let out a long sigh while standing in front of the man covered in dirt.

“Whew. Viscount Baker. You broke the pillars again?”

At those words, a humorous voice was heard.

“Kevin. I told you to just call me by my name when we were alone. What’s with Viscount Baker? Just call me Viscount Reil.”

It was a really comical expression and hand movements.

The middle aged man covered in dirt was the rumoured genius spearman Reil Baker.

Next to him was the steward Kevin, who served him for more than 30 years.

“We are nobles that don’t even have a territory, but we have a need to act like one. On top of that, do you know how many things there are as nobles? Even now there are many people that wish to see you and some invita…..”

When he talked up to then.

Reil raised his right hand.

“Stop. I understand so stop the lecturing. Just how many things are there to do?”

At those words Kevin took one more step and gathered all the papers and letters that were spread on the table.

“Excluding the non important ones, this much remain.”

A paper mountain that surged up the table.

At that moment, Reil frowned and had a weird expression.

“Huh? Why is there this much?”

“It gets piled up as you don’t do any work all day and just focus on training in the spear.”

A sulky voice.

Kevin was a bit upset.

Reil wanted to say something but didn’t.

‘If I talk wrongly here I have to hear his complaints for 10 days.’

He glanced at Kevin and then put his hand among the pile of paper.

“Ahem.”

An awkward cough.

It meant to tell him to get out, but Kevin didn’t move at all.

Review it quickly.

His eyes were telling that.

Reil smacked his lips and then looked at the pile of papers.

“Mmm. This is a request to give a speech in Miller academy. I did it last year so… declined. This is an invitation to a brat’s party that’s from the family of a duke, obviously declined. I already met this one the past month, so declined. This region, I went the last month……”

Swish. Swish. Swish. Swish.

The papers and the letters flew to the sides busily.

Reil vaguely looked at the titles and kept yelling decline.

Kevin’s body started to tremble.

He was right before exploding.

There was no way Reil didn’t discover that.

‘He’s angry. Angry.’

Reil, who was about to throw away one more letter, stopped. Then he acted as if he was looking at the letter thoroughly.

“Mmm. It’s sent by Baron Aaron from the east. If it’s Aaron Tate…..”

He acted like he fell into his thoughts just to cool down Kevin’s anger.

“Ah! He’s the one I met at Miller kingdom when I went to the forge! His ability to pick a spear was outstanding.”

A forge operated by one of the three best blacksmiths in the kingdom.

Reil met Aaron at the regular forgery he went to.

He thoroughly checked every weapon, unlike a noble, and then bought the spear Reil had picked.

‘As he was different to the other nobles, I liked him.’

Then, they greeted each other and promised to meet each other next time.

‘Now that I see it, he raised great merits at this Slen battle and Pedian’s monster subjugation.’

He also knew about the news about the 7th corps.

Suddenly, he felt interested.

“Why would baron Aaron Tate have sent me a letter? Hmm. Hm. Hmmmm. Hm.” Reil hummed and stamped the letter.

And then after a while of reading the contents, he burst out of laughter.

“Huh! This man, I thought that he was fine but he’s a real bragger.”

He shook his head.

Kevin, that was looking at him, and frowned.

“What’s the contents?”

He was also curious.

Reil smirked and looked at the letter.

“I will tell you what’s written. He says that there’s an 18 year old class 5 adjutant on one of his troops and he found out about the ambush of a goblin army and slew their leader. Not only that, but he found out about the large scale surprise monster attack of Pedian’s plain and faced the ogres on top of that. This is not the only thing. It wasn’t enough by planning the inundation strategy on Prely river, but he also slew the orc leader Se…..”

“He slew Sedek?”

Kevin butted in.

“Huh?”

Reid had a bit surprised face.

“How did you know that?”

At the question, Kevin shook his head.

“That’s why I told you to read the battle reports I gave you thoroughly.”

A rebuking sound.

Rein opened his eyes roundly.

“Then all of these things are true?”

“Yes. If it’s a letter sent by Aaron Tate of the 7th corps.”

Kevin answered with a rather uninterested expression.

In the other hand, Reil had a surprised face.

“Wow. So all of these things are true, huh?”

His mouth slightly raised.

Then, Kevin’s voice was heard.

“After looking at this Slen battle report, the soldier that slew Violin’s head also seems to be that class 5 soldier.”

“Ohhhh!”

‘An 18 year old greenhorn accumulated these kind of merits?’

Certainly, there was no way for a person that had good eyes for picking good weapons to not be able to see well.

He raised the letter and looked at Kevin.

He was glaring at him with sharp eyes.

‘Anyways, if I stay here I will just keep hearing his nagging……’

He looked at the letter again.

‘And the contents of the letter are also interesting.’

Now he was also curious about the 7th corps that was being a lot nowadays.

‘I have never gone to the eastern parts of the kingdom…….’

A smile appeared on his face.

He shook the letter and looked at Kevin.

“Kevin. I will go to the east to sight see for a while.”

At those words Kevin shook his head.

He pointed to the piled papers, letters and invitations.

“There are still these many things you have to check.”

A firm and determined voice and attitude.

Reil smiled brightly and nodded.

He stood up and then swept up everything on the table with his right arm.

Paaat!

The papers and letters that scattered in the air.

“Wh, just what……..”

When Kevin was fumbling with a surprised expression.

Reil’s humorous voice was heard.

“All declined.”

Chapter 55




Roan and Chris kept talking about light things for a while.

After the strawberries were starting to fall short, Roan asked in a low voice.

“How’s the agency going?”

At those words Chris looked at the insides of the building and smiled faintly.

“It’s not bad taking into account I just started.”

He settled in quite a fast time with the comrades he used to run errands with.

And now he was requesting the entrance application for the tourists that wanted to come to Miller castle and the surroundings instead of them.

‘However…..’

Chris gulped down the words that surged up to his throat.

“How good.”

Roan sincerely congratulate him.

‘I can’t do it.’

Chris, who hesitated for a moment, stood up as if he couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Wait a moment.”

Then, he went to a table and looked for something and after that he came back with piles of paper.

“Will you look at this?”

The piles of papers he gave to Roan.

Roan carefully received it and asked back.

“What’s this?”

At those words Chris laughed awkwardly and scratched the back of his head.

“It’s information I gathered about Miller castle and the surrounding regions while running the agency. I was doing it unconsciously.”

“Ah…..”

Roan let out a low exclamation and started to look at the contents.

For a while, only the sound of paper passing was heard.

Chris seemed somewhat uneasy.

‘I feel like an academy student that’s being evaluated on a subject.’

He smirked and shook his head.

After a while Roan placed down the papers and looked at Chris.

His face was stiffened.

Chris gulped dry saliva.

“Why are you like this? Is this such a mess?”

At those words Roan whispered like he was whispering.

“It would be good if you didn’t publish this as you wish.”

“Ah……Is it that much?”

Chris was really dispirited.

Then, Roan continued to say.

“There is really important information written down systematically. If you make a bad move you may be seen as a spy of an enemy kingdom.”

“Ah……”

Chris let out a low exclamation.

His stiffened face loosened up and his mouth raised.

‘I got recognized.’

Actually, he was pondering in big way about his identity.

Travel agency and information group.

Although he did start working like this, he felt bigger fun just by collecting information about Miller castle and the surrounding regions.

‘It’s the first time I felt this much fun since I was born.’

Every time he heard small information and unbelievable rumours, he put in more effort to gather more authentic rumours.

It wasn’t because he wanted to be treated in some way or because someone asked him to.

He just felt too much fun.

‘If I were to pick the travel agency or the information group…….’

The answer was already set.

Then Roan’s voice was heard.

“Mister Chris. This is really amazing. The height of Miller castle, length, precise location of the gate, structure, the shifts of the guards, and the inner castle. Not only that but the location of the surrounding villages and main roads, and important information of each village is registered.”

“Yes. I gathered and analyzed all the information I could gather.”

Chris replied like it was nothing.

No, he replied like it truly was nothing.

Roan continued saying.

“On top of that there’s also information about important people in this region.”

“After gathering the rumours, I just picked out the authentic ones.”

Certainly, it was a casual voice.

No, he tried to make it seem that way.

Roan smiled faintly and said in a low voice.

“Mister Chris. I think that your talent is even more amazing than what I had thought.”

Boom.

Chris felt a big rock falling on his chest.

A joy he couldn’t precisely describe with words surrounded his entire body.

Roan just looked at that Chris.

Actually, he was much more surprised than what he was showing.

‘To even guess the things that would happen from now on…..’

There were some things written about what would happen in the future, and among them there was information Roan actually knew.

‘The cases that would really happen.’

Chris had precisely guessed the future with limited information.

‘He certainly is the head of the agency that had all the information on the continent in his hands and made the continent shake.’

After looking at the papers, he felt an even greater urge to grab Chris.

However he didn’t want to force him.

He was planning to wait until he truly wanted to do it himself.

Then, Chris that was looking down at the papers, said in a low voice.

“If I get to work in things related to information, what will I be doing?”

He pointed at the papers.

Roan felt that the situation was somewhat weird.

‘The time of choice has come.’

He took some breaths and said with a composed voice.

“Yes. You have to do these things. Only……”

“Only…..”

Chris copied Roan’s words unconsciously.

Roan pointed at the pile of papers and continued saying.

“You will be handling information about a wider world and broader information.”

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation followed.

Chris felt that his heart beat quickly and that his blood flowed quickly.

This world was much broader and colorful than Miller.

‘I’m grasping all of those things.’

Something that made his chest swell just by thinking of it.

Chris slowly calmed his breath.

He smiled faintly and looked at Roan.

‘Mister Chris.’

Roan forcefully hid his urgent feeling.

He just waited for Chris’s reply.

A moment’s silence.

Poke.

Chris poked the pile of papers with his finger.

“Much broader information and more various than this…..”

His voice was calm but the end slightly shook.

He couldn’t know if he was nervous or excited.

Chris looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly and continued saying.

“I want to handle it.”

Roan didn’t show any reaction.

He just looked at Chris’s eyes.

However Chris didn’t feel stuffed or uneasy.

Roan’s hot eyes.

That was enough.

Chris stood up.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

He bowed his head.

“Take good care of me from now on.”

A voice filled with strength.

As it turned out like this, Roan too couldn’t keep still.

He stood up and bowed.

“Also take good care of me.”

A historical day.

Roan and Chris grabbed hands.

The people who were looking at different directions now looked at the same one.

Then, Roan smiled brightly and said in a low voice.

“Then, should I give you the first task?”

“Already?”

Chris asked back with a surprised expression.

Roan smiled faintly.

“The world is wide but time is limited.”

At those words Chris nodded.

Roan continued to say.

“I’m planning to invest in the merchants in Miller. To the young merchants that are a bit vague right now but have a bright future. I’m talking about people just like you.”

This was the reason he came to Chris in the first place.

‘Should I listen to Chris’s opinion?’

Roan put a strange smile and carefully asked.

“Don’t you have anyone to recommend to me?”

At those words Chris went silent for a moment.

But it wasn’t because he didn’t have anything to say.

The instincts of an information gatherer in getting the initiative of the conversation.

Chris took in a breath and replied in a calm voice.

“There are some. They have talent and their nature is great, so their future is bright.”

“How many are they?”

At the question, Chris extended five fingers.

“Tio, Lidia, Eska, Lego, Ford. It’s these five people.”

Confident voice.

Roan didn’t ask anymore and took out the bag containing the gems.

“Take this.”

Chris carefully received the bag.

“What’s this?”

“Investment. As I don’t have much time and on top of that I am a soldier, my actions are really limited. So I would like you to invest in those five instead of me.”

Chris had a surprised expression.

“What if something goes wrong as I invest as I wish?”

Roan answered like it was nothing.

“You can’t always succeed at investing. It doesn’t matter if it fails with everyone. That by itself will become valuable information.”

At those words Chris slowly nodded.

“And…..”

Roan took out one more gem bag.

“This is investment i’m giving to you. You will need quite a lot of money to make a full fledged information agency.”

“Ah…..”

Chris let out a low exclamation.

He then nodded.

“I understand. I will do my best not to disappoint you.”

“Yes. I believe in you.”

Roan grabbed his bag and stood up.

“Then, I will be leaving.”

“Already? Why don’t you eat something?”

It was an urgent voice.

However Roan shook his head.

“The path I have to walk is long.”

He extended his right hand.

Chris couldn’t talk back anymore and grabbed that hand.

“I will find you with good results.”

“I will be waiting for you.”

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“Then, I will be leaving.”

A farewell.

Roan shook his hands once and then moved outside the agency.

Chris let out a long sigh.

‘Is it a new start?’

He felt his chest beating even more than when he first opened the travel agency.

‘First, should I go and find those five merchants?’

Chris bit his lower lip and slowly moved.

This was his first task and road.

*****

The Lancephil was a weird family for various reasons.

He was one of the five counts from Rinse kingdom that didn’t have a residence in the capital of Miller, didn’t even have a territory and was located in a barren land in the south.

Because of that Ipen castle, Beno castle, etc. were all inside the territory of Count Lancephil.

But the real reason he was special was because of Io Lancephil, who was the head of the family and one of the five counts of the kingdom.

This year he turned out 60, but he didn’t have any children.

Of course, there were various reasons for that, for a count that was in his sixties to not have any children was a really exceptional case.

Because of that, a similar conversation came and went in the castle everyday.

“Sir Count. You aren’t late yet. If you marry now…..”

“Just stop hohoho.”

It was a laughter that made people feel good.

The middle aged man who was suggesting with an earnest heart let out a long sigh.

‘Whew. He’s once again laughing like this.’

He looked at the old man and had a regretful face.

‘To devote all of his youth for the sake of the kingdom and to already become that old. Tch. It’s the frailty of life.’

The man seemed to have read the thoughts of the middle aged man and he laughed off once again.

“Hohoho. Albert. I’m really fine.”

At those words the middle aged man Albert Wein bowed.

“Yes. I understand sir Count Lancephil.”

The man that seemed good natured was one of the five counts in Rinse kingdom and the lord of the eastern region, Io Lancephil.

Io slowly started to move while carrying his baggage.

“Then, should we go outside the castle?”

“Yes. Understood.”

As Albert shook his left hand, the knights that were lined up to the sides ran outside the castle a step ahead of them.

Io and Albert followed them from behind.

Albert looked at Io’s white hair and bit his lower lip.

‘He could have been in possession of the central region but he said he would keep Byron kingdom and Estel kingdom in check and he personally was put in charge of the outer regions as his territory. As the love he feels towards the kingdom is that extreme, his interests would obviously change.’

It had already been more than 30 years since he served Io.

He was called as the second lieutenant knight guard until now, and he even received a title of viscount.

‘If my health was good I would have served him a bit more…….’

Retirement was decided for Albert.

Then, Io who was walking in front let out a short sigh.

“It doesn’t remain long for you and this scenery.”

“I’m sorry sir count.”

“There’s no need to be so. You are also quite old. Holding onto you until now was also my greed.”

At those words Albert lowered his face.

“Viscount Kali Owells, who was decided to become my successor is a more outstanding knight than I am.”

“Really? Hohoho.”

Io burst out in laughter.

However it somewhat felt like he didn’t completely like it.

After they got out of the castle they entered a long road.

Io liked inspecting Pavor castle, from what he had to do, the most.

It was the opportunity to check the lifestyle of the residents himself and sympathize with them.

And the residents truly liked Io and respected him.

Because of that, the day when Io did the inspecting, the road was more noisy and busy.

Just like there was a festival.

But today it was an exception.

The road was dead silent.

Io looked at the residents with a strange expression.

‘The expressions…….’

They had really scared looks.

Then, a serious looking middle aged man approached him.

He bowed towards Io and Albert.

“We finished the preparations for the investigation.”

In that instant, Io knew the reason as to why the residents were scared.

‘It seems the knights scare them.’

He felt bitter.

“Hohoho.”

A laugher.

But this one was filled with displeasure.

He looked at Albert and said in a whispering voice.

“Albert. I don’t know why but it seems like I will already miss you. Hohoho.”

At those words Albert glared at the middle aged man in front of him.

‘Kali Owells. You stupid bastard.’

The middle aged man who looked serious.

This was the successor for Albert and the one that was leading the knights, Kali Owells.

He was the head of the Owells family and was also the father of Walter Owells who was related with Roan.

‘Kali. Your abilities and talent are outstanding, but that excessive aspiration is the problem of your ambition.’

Albert became speechless and looked at Io.

He was still laughing.

However Albert could know.

‘He’s really angry.’

He wanted to loosen his mood with whatever he could.

Then, a young knight passed over the crowd and approached them.

‘Huh?’

While he frowned and tilted his head, the guy approached and whispered.

“Ah……”

At that instant, Albert’s face brightened.

He looked at Io and said as if he was whispering.

“Sir Count. Even so it seems like he have to leave the inspection for another time.”

“It seems like something has happened?”

Io slightly tilted his head and asked back.

“It seems like Viscount Reil Baker has come to visit to Ipen castle.”

Chapter 56




‘I knew that he was a free person……’

Aaron was a bit dumbfounded.

Although he was riding a horse, his conscience was half gone.

And that was because of the middle aged man riding the horse and having fun in front of him.

“Hahaha! The taste of riding the plains of the east is good!”

A magnanimous laugh.

A face full of playfulness.

That was the rumoured genius spearman Reil Baker.

‘To appear early at dawn with only one knight accompanying him.’

Aaron was astounded.

Even he, who was free and open, wasn’t as much as Reil was.

“Hahaha! Liam! Your cavalry skills are a mess! Why do you keep falling behind?!”

Reil, who was riding in front, yelled towards the accompanying knight.

The knight, Liam, laughed awkwardly and kicked his horse.

‘Sir viscount. Please save me some face.’

He remembered the entrusting words Kevin told him before leaving their territory.

The accompanying knight doesn’t only have to escort. He has to protect Viscount Baker’s dignity.

Liam let out a sigh.

‘In the first place, there’s no dignity to protect.’

For now he stuck next to Reil.

“Umm sir viscount. I know that you feel good, but even so, at least……..”

When he talked up to then.

Reil pointed forward and yelled.

“I can see Beno castle!”

And then, he yelled towards Aaron and the following soldiers.

“The person that arrives the latest buys breakfast!”

An absurd story.

However Reil stuck his chest towards the horse and started to ride fiercely.

When Aaron and the staff officers of the 7th squad were putting an absent minded face, Liam let out a sigh and said.

“He’s truly saying that.”

And then he also kicked the horse and started to ride quickly.

“Huh?”

“What?”

Aaron and the officers.

The others laughed awkwardly and looked at each other and then grabbed the reins and started to ride.

And they started to kick their horses almost at the same time.

Heeeeeng!

The rough cry of the horse.

The sudden race competition started just like that.

*****

“Whew. I’m full.”

Reil patted his stomach and looked at Aaron.

“Baron Aaron. I ate really well.”

“Yes? Ah, yes. I’m glad you did so.”

Aaron looked at his empty money pocket and shook his head.

‘For him to really receive food.’

Of course, the last one in the race was Aaron.

However, normally it wasn’t a custom for a person of a higher rank to be treated from someone by a lower rank.

‘He really has no ranks in mind.’

Aaron looked at Reil, who was riding in front, and had a faint smile.

He couldn’t get a grasp of him and he was beyond himself, but he liked him quite much.

“Anyways, it’s still regrettable. I wanted to meet adjutant Roan.”

Reil smacked his lips.

Only after he arrived at Ipen castle did he come to know that Roan was in a retired state.

At most he said that it would take three months, so the remaining time was one month.

Then, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“He will return soon, so why don’t you wait some time and meet him?”

“Mmm.”

Reil pondered for a moment and then shook his head.

‘Even so, I can’t leave my territory for one whole month.’

He bitterly smiled.

“That will be a bit difficult.”

A negative answer.

Regret was shown in Aaron’s face for a moment.

‘Can’t do anything about it.’

Actually, for a viscount or a noble to wait one month to meet a mere 5 class adjutant was an absurd thing.

Aaron bowed.

“Then, I will go and find you the moment he returns.”

It was a really sorry expression.

However, it wasn’t his fault.

Reil had more of a fault that couldn’t check the letter beforehand for being taken in his spear training.

“Do so. For now, I will be satisfied with just meeting rose troop.”

It was the troop Roan belonged to and had a reputation for having taken the biggest role in Slen battle.

‘Just by looking at the Slen battle report, it was quite an outstanding troop…….’

Meeting an outstanding commander and the soldiers was always a fun thing.

Having ridden from Ipen castle to Beno castle without resting was also to experience that fun.

“I will lead you.”

Aaron started to walk one step ahead.

They walked the streets of Beno castle and then they arrived at the headquarters of rose troop.

Every time he passed a building, a faint sound was heard.

‘Mmm?’

But the only one that heard that among them was Reil.

He flinched for a moment and then changed directions.

“Huh? Viscount Baker, it’s not over there but here.”

Aaron called him aloud but Reil started to walk in a weird direction as if he was possessed.

‘It’s a really sharp noise.’

Reil went around the building and stood around a big empty lot.

“Ah………”

A low exclamation flowed out.

It was quite the large training ground.

One youth was training in his spear.

But his spear skills were really strange.

‘It’s not a spearmanship taught by the kingdom.’

Reil hid his presence and looked at the youth training his spear for a while.

Aaron, Liam and the officers that followed late also hid their presence like him.

Paat! Pabat! Paat!

A sharp sound hit their ears continuously.

The spear drew a line of light as if it was dancing.

The spear that drew an elegant line and the movements that followed softly.

“Ah……Amazing.”

Liam, who was watching him, couldn’t hold it in and let out an exclamation.

Aaron and the other officers were the same.

A surprised look was seen on their faces.

Reil looked at Aaron and asked in a low voice.

“Who’s that youth?”

“Yes? Th, thats…….”

Aaron was perplexed for a moment and then looked at the officers.

However the officers also laughed awkwardly and shook their heads.

“He has such an amazing spearmanship but you don’t even know who he is? Hahaha.”

Reil laughed magnanimously and moved his feet.

He approached the youth with big steps.

“Hey!”

A loud yell.

The youth stopped in the posture that he was swinging the spear in.

“Who……..Huh?!”

The youth who was looking at Reil with a weird expression looked at Aaron. His eyes traces the others around his back and he hurriedly fixed his posture.

“Sir!”

He had a straight posture.

Aaron lightly shook his head.

“He is Viscount Reil Baker. Answer his questions.”

“Yes!”

The youth answered in a loud voice and looked at Reil.

“I’m spearman Pierce from the 12th squad of rose troop belonging to the 7th corps!”

The youth, his identity was Pierce.

Reil smiled faintly and grabbed Pierce’s shoulders.

“What’s the spearmanship you executed just now? It wasn’t a spearmanship from the kingdom.”

At those words Pierce was a bit perplexed.

He hesitated and couldn’t reply easily.

Aaron frowned.

“Pierce. The Viscount is asking you.”

Pierce looked at Aaron and Reil alternatingly and let out a long sigh.

“That’s……..It’s a spearmanship I learned separately.”

“Separately? From who?”

Reil asked.

‘It’s an amazing spearmanship. It’s a really strong spearmanship that even normal soldiers without mana can execute.’

He really wanted to know who was the one who taught him this.

Pierce hesitated once more and then answered as if he couldn’t do anything about it.

“It’s adjutant Roan from rose troop.”

Boom.

At that instant Reil, Aaron, and all the others had surprised expressions.

It was because a name they hadn’t expected at all had come out.

‘I knew that Roan had outstanding talent……..’

He didn’t know that he had learned this strong spearmanship.

No, he didn’t know he was so skilled to teach this to others.

“Ho!”

Reil feigned a laugh.

‘An 18 year old adjutant taught this kind of spearmanship?’

He looked at Aaron.

“Baron Tate.”

“Yes?”

Aaron replied while confused.

Reil continued speaking with a serious expression.

“Give me a room to stay for one month.”

And then, he looked at Pierce.

“And you. Were you called Pierce?”

“Yes? Yes!”

Pierce replied while putting a stiff posture.

Reil’s mouth rose.

“You will have to talk with me.”

*****

Roan, who left the capital of Miller was entering the eastern region of the kingdom.

‘In two more days is it Slen region………’

Meanwhile, the season turned to become summer.

The sun shined strongly and the west wind came blowing with a strong heat.

But of course Roan couldn’t feel any heat because of Brent’s ring.

He looked down at the ring.

‘However I think of it, this isn’t an artifact a human is capable of manufacturing.’

Although Louis was a magician of the 6th circle, he lacked the skills to make this kind of artifact.

This meant that Brent’s ring was that amazing.

‘To even be able to breathe under water.’

Although he couldn’t maintain it for long because the mana spent was too severe, he could certainly breathe underwater.

Not only that, but he could record the sound of a conversation or memorize a scenery or a sight.

‘But of course, this also spends a lot of mana.’

Anyways, it was a ring that showed more functions, which he hadn’t even thought about, the more his ability to operate mana increased.

‘Now that I see it, Kalian’s tear is also an amazing artifact.’

Roan moved his sight and looked at the end of the plain.

A normal scenery that was no different than usual.

However, as he inserted mana in the tear, the scenery changed in an instant.

A golden wave filled his sight.

‘So this is mana……’

When he inserted mana into the tear, he could see the mana spread aorund in the world.

Although it was a function that didn’t help him at all in normal situations, it was quite a useful ability in battles or emergencies.

Because when someone used mana or moved, the golden wave in their surroundings contorted or producesd a slight change.

Because of that, Roan could guess the actions of the opponent beforehand and know what it was.

‘If the level of my mana increases, more functions will appear, right?’

An expression filled with expectation.

Roan pulled back his mana along with a faint smile.

At that moment, the scenery that was filled with golden waves turned to normal.

‘Huh?’

Then, he saw a displeasing movement at the end of his sight.

‘That’s…….’

Roan glared at the end of the plains.

At that instant, the scenery that was far away got expanded.

‘Goblin?’

A small goblin army was running across the plains.

On top of that, all of them were holding blades.

Although they were far away, he could feel a ferocious intent from their bodies or expressions.

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘Are they planning to attack the village?’

It was something that happened frequently in a place that was not inside the safe zone.

‘Although this village should have a vigilance guard…..’

Just by guessing, the number of the goblin army was close to 200.

At the slightest slipup, the guards would collapse and the village would be annihilated.

‘If there are no forces that inspect the territory or they don’t have a region troop……’

It was quite a dangerous situation.

Roan didn’t think anymore.

Tat!

He charged through and started to chase the backs of the goblins.

In the worst case, it was to at least help them by himself.

Passs.

Behind Roan’s back, a hot wind blew

******

“Damn! Block them! Don’t let them cross the fence!”

Gut stood at the watch tower and kept firing arrows in succession.

Chwee! Chwee!

The cries of the goblins hit their ears.

Beyond the fence that was built with several layers, 200 goblins were charging through.

Sweeeee!

Arrows poured from the watch tower.

However, the skills of the guards of this village weren’t that outstanding.

Pusk. Puk. Puuk.

Most of the arrows hit the ground and not the goblins.

‘Damn! That’s why I told you to practice firing arrows even when you are busy with farming!’

Only Gut, who was the head of the guards of Whose village, showed cool skills and fought alone.

Puk!

Chwee!

One arrow pierced the head of a goblin.

‘I wondered why they were so calm nowadays……’

The goblins of this region normally grouped in tens and attacked big and small villages.

However, nowadays those things had stopped.

When Gut and the others were slightly relaxing.

Suddenly, an amazing number of goblins they hadn’t faced until now appeared.

‘Damn. Will we be able to block them?’

Doubt was seen in his eyes.

The number of the guards were 30.

And adding the men who had some experience they amounted to 100.

Although they were at a disadvantage with numbers, taking into account that their enemies were goblins, it wasn’t that pessimistic of a situation.

However.

‘How do you want us to fight with pickaxes!’

Only 30 people were holding things that could be called weapons.

The guards and the villagers were originally farmers so they neglected weapon maintenance.

Because of that, most had pickaxes, sickles, and hoes.

‘Damn. It’s kill or die!’

They did send the fast guards to the nearest region troop, but they had almost no probability to hold until they arrived.

Chwee! Chwee!

Meanwhile, the goblins came near the fence.

Bang! Babang!

They smashed the fence with their bodies or tried to jump over it.

Fortunately, as they were short, they couldn’t cross it in one go.

“Die!”

“Dirty goblin bastards!”

The guards stuck to the fences and stabbed them with their spears.

Stab.

“Kyaaak!”

“Chweee!”

The goblins who were trying to get inside the village without any fear were stabbed with the spear and lost their lives.

“Throw rocks!”

“Fire arrows!”

They started to throw rocks and arrows from the watchtower at the goblins that were gathered in the fence.

The number of the goblins that started to fall increased.

Chwee! Chwee!

As it turned out like this, they could have retreated, but they would rather charge more fiercely.

The goblins climbed over the corpses of their dead allies and started to cross the fence.

Boom.

Corpses that piled up over the other corpses.

In an instant, a solid foothold was made outside the fence.

Chwee!

The goblin that seemed to be the leader shook his hand and cried.

Chwee! Chwee!

The goblins started to run towards the fence while holding their blades.

Tok! Todok!

They stepped on the corpses of their allies and jumped over.

“Huh?! Block them!”

Gut, who was looking at the situation, yelled.

Only then did the guards and the villagers raise their blades, spears, hoes, and sickles.

“Block them!”

“Kill!”

“If this gets broken through, our famillies will be in danger!”

They put their lives on the line for their loved ones.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

As the blade of the goblins clashed with the weapon of the farmers, sparks flew off.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh!”

They guards and the villages men ground their teeth and held on, but because of their lacking experience and weapons, they started to slowly get pushed back.

‘Damn. We aren’t in a situation to be firing arrows.’

Gut tightly bit his lower lip.

The 100 plus goblins started to climb the fence in turns.

Then.

Sweeeee!

A sharp sound hit their ears.

‘What is it?’

Gut turned his head to the place where the sound was heard.

Puk!

The spear trembled while being stuck in the ground.

“Just what is……”

The people that were on the fence and the goblins who were trying to cross over the fence had surprised faces and looked towards the place where the spear came flying from.

“Huh?”

“Chwee?”

Their eyes grew big.

One youth was running along the west wind.

He came with a fast speed and fierce intent.

His rough hair fluttered with the wind.

A youth that was still a child but emanated a wild feeling.

It was Roan.

Chapter 57




Chwee! Chwee!

The goblins let out cries.

The comrades that died helplessly at the spear suddenly came flying back.

Their eyes turned red.

Chwee!

Four goblins, who still hadn’t crossed over the fence, kicked the ground and charged towards Roan.

The distance between Roan and the goblins closed in an instant.

Slash! Stab!

The four goblins swung their blades consecutively.

“No!”

“Damn!”

Whoever saw it, Roan’s life was in danger.

The blade of the goblins was about to hack over Roan’s body.

The people in the watch tower couldn’t watch anymore as they turned their heads and frowned.

However, only Gut fixed his gaze.

‘That’s not a scared or an urgent expression at all!’

Roan’s expression was very calm.

On top of that, his mouth was slightly raised.

Actually, Roan didn’t feel pressed at all.

‘Now, things such as goblins are funny.’

Roan looked at the blades flying towards him, fixedly.

Swaaaa.

The scenery turned slowly to the point where he yawned.

Roan circulated the mana and nimbly moved his body.

Swish.

They were soft movements.

He slightly twisted his body and dodged the first blade with leisure.

Cheng!

At the same time, he took out a small and sharp blade from his waist.

Stab.

The short sword stabbed the back of the first goblin.

Paaat!

Every blood drop was seen continued by the pulled sword.

The scene in front of him was so slow it made you sick and it was seen clearly.

‘I’m not the me from before.’

Although the level of his mana wasn’t high yet, knowing how to utilize it and not knowing was like the difference between heaven and earth.

‘Now, I can attack the blind spots through the weak spots I can see with Kalian’s tear.’

But of course, he was still lacking a lot.

It was like he could try something which he hadn’t even been able to before.

He was at a level where he could face basic warriors like goblins and orcs, easily.

Spat!

Roan also dodged the second blade and stabbed the sword into the chin of the second goblin.

‘Hmph! Where!’

At the same time he extended his left hand and grabbed the throat of the third one.

Chwee?

The goblin broke his posture and was pulled.

Right over him, the blade of the fourth goblin fell with a fierce intent.

Slash.

The head of the third goblin was cut off by the fourth one.

Pat!

At the same time, the scenery that was so slow it made him yawn, returned to normal.

‘Kugh. My eyes hurt a lot.’

As he saw the scenery in slow motion through Kalian’s tear, his eyes were hurting.

Then.

Grr. Grrrr. Grr.

Three goblins that were standing completely fine, collapsed almost at the same time.

Blood started to fall from their neck.

Chwee?

The fourth goblin that got left alone in an instant, opened his eyes roundly.

He had an expression where he couldn’t believe that he killed his ally with his own hands.

Roan passed by next to him with a casual expression and swung his sword.

Pibit.

A thin red line appeared on the neck.

Grr.

The last and fourth one also fell onto the floor.

‘Im, impossible!’

Gut, who was checking the situation, opened his mouth.

‘What just happened right now?!’

He couldn’t believe the scene that happened before him.

‘He was closing in the goblins, they were swinging their blades, and he pulled back.’

It certainly seemed like that.

However the moment Roan made his third step, three goblins fell.

And the fourth one also fell while grabbing his neck.

‘It happened in an instant and I couldn’t see anything.’

But there was one certain thing.

That Roan perfectly took care of four goblins.

‘Knight? Soldier? Mercenary?’

When Gut was rolling his eyes to try and identify Roan’s identity.

Roan walked and stood in front of the spear that was stuck in the ground.

Swush.

As he stepped on the two goblins that had the spear pierced in them and pulled it, a dark red blood flowed with the spear.

Roan walked while holding his spear.

‘Take care of the goblins at the fastest possible speed.’

He needed to hurry a little more to save any unnecessary deaths.

Tat!

He charged forward and flew into the air.

“Wha, what is it?”

Chwee?

The people and the goblins looked at Roan and had surprised expressions.

At that moment, Roan’s spear drew a line of light.

Spat!

The spear slashed the goblins.

Pibit!

Following the spear, a line of dark red blood spread into the air.

At the same time.

Kyaaaaaak!

The cries of the goblins hit his ear.

*****

Io, who spent most of his young times in the battlefield, couldn’t stand still while looking at the knights and soldiers that had skills and also had a good nature.

Not enough with big and small amounts of patronage, he also invited people regardless of their identity and rank and even spent some days with them.

However, nowadays it was difficult to find a guy that he liked.

No, even so, there was one he liked.

‘Viscount Reil Baker.’

A treasure of Rinse kingdom and the spear genius.

He was also a middle aged man that was in his forties, but his skills were amazing to be counted in one hand.

And not only his skills.

His nature and personality was also great.

Rather than obsessing in useless ambitions, he concentrated and focused on his training.

‘Viscount Baker is the best in Rinse kingdom right now.’

Although there were famous knights and captains, but Io picked Reil as the best.

‘It just seems like watching my young self.’

A proud smile.

However Io frowned.

‘I sent him countless invitations…….’

As he appreciated him a lot, he wanted to leave him at his side and check what he did.

However Reil had various excuses and didn’t participate in the parties.

‘But that kind of guy suddenly visited the castle?’

Io had a weird expression.

It was difficult to believe, but there would be no way the report was wrong.

‘I don’t know the reason, but it’s certain that it’s a good opportunity.’

The distance between Pavor castle and Ipen castle wasn’t that far.

An opportunity to meet him and converse for a long while.

His mouth slightly raised.

‘Does he like it that much?’

Even Albert, who was looking him at the side, started to smile.

‘To depart the moment he received the report.’

On top of that, he chose a horse rather than a carriage as the means of transport.

Io liked and appreciated Reil that much.

Dudududu.

The sound of horse steps hit their ears.

Then, Kali Owells who was riding at the front, turned back and yelled.

“Sir count!”

He had a stiffened expression.

Albert replied in a loud voice instead of Io.

“What happened?!”

Kali pointed the end of the plains.

“I think that something happened.”

At those words, Io and Albert opened their eyes sharply and looked towards the end of the plain.

A village could was seen faintly.

Black smoke was seen along with unusual movements on the fence.

There certainly was something wrong.

‘Maybe?’

Io’s and Albert’s faces turned hard.

‘Did monsters raid the village?’

A possible story.

Io quickly sent the order.

“Now, let’s go.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Kali replied in a loud voice and kicked his horse.

The escorting knights followed his back.

‘They have to be safe.’

Io took in a deep breath and grinded his teeth.

Dudududu.

The sound of horse steps became clearer.

*****

‘Wha, what’s this youth?’

‘A roaming warrior?’

‘Is he a mercenary?’

The guards and villagers of Whose village were half absentminded.

At the end of their sight was Roan.

And Roan was slaying the goblins while moving like wind between them.

‘It’s an amazing spearmanship.’

A strong and concise spearmanship even in the eyes of an outsider.

Chwee! Chwee!

If goblins could talk in human tongue, they would have yelled like this.



But unfortunately, the sounds they could make was limited.

Chwee!

It was a dispirited cry.

Kyaaaak!

And a sharp last cry.

The goblins couldn’t become Roan’s opponent.

‘Where!’

There was leisure in Roan’s movements.

On top of that, he even checked the state of the villagers in the middle of the massacre.

“It’s dangerous.”

A short shout.

At the same time he pulled the shoulders of the villager.

“Hut!”

He staggered, and stepped back.

At that moment, a blade stabbed into the ground where he originally was.

If he made a wrong move, he would have had his neck cut off.

“Ah……..Tha, thank you.”

The villages man bowed with an absent minded expression.

Roan smiled faintly and swung his spear once more.

A one sided slaying and massacre occurred.

Chwee! Chwee!

The cries were spat out faster.

Urgency and a bit of fear could be seen in the ugly faces of the goblins.

Chwee!

In the end the leader raised his right hand.

It was the retreat sign.

Chwee! Chwee!

About 30 goblins crossed to the other side of the fence and fled outside the village.

“Where!”

Roan wasn’t planning on leaving them alone.

If he did so, other villages would also be attacked.

‘I can’t miss even one!’

It was when Roan was about to charge to the front for a perfect clearing.

Sweeeeee!

Pubububuk!

Suddenly, a rain of arrows fell outside the fence.

Kaaaaak! Kyak!

The goblins became like porcupines and fell one by one.

When Roan turned to look, he had a weird expression.

Dudududu.

The sound of horse steps shaking the ground was heard.

At the same time, tens of soldiers appeared. No, they certainly are…

‘They are knights.’

Flashy armor and a huge long sword.

They were the escort knights of Lancephil.

The knights massacred the fleeing goblins without missing one.

Roan stepped on their corpses and looked at them.

“Wh, what are they?”

“Looking at how their armor shines, they must be knights.”

The villagers gathered behind Roan.

Gut, who appeared late, and extended his head over the fence.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out.

Even so, he had recognized the symbol drawn on their armor.

“It’s the symbol for the Lancephil family.”

At those words, nervousness was seen on the faces of the people.

They stuck themselves closely behind Roan.

Rather than the flashy knights, Roan who looked kind of simple seemed to be more friendly.

Meanwhile, the knights that massacred the goblins approached the entrance of the village.

“Open the doors!”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Kali hit the tightly closed entrance with the end of his sheath.

As Gut made eye signs, the guards hurriedly ran and opened the doors.

Clop. Clop.

The knights lined up into lines at the sides.

After a while, Io and Albert showed themselves between them.

Roan was still stepping on the corpses of the goblins.

At that instant, Io and Roan made eye contact.

‘He slew tens of goblins alone. It was an amazing spearmanship.’

Amazement could be seen in Io’s face.

He stood outside the village and looked at Roan’s actions.

‘A concise and strong spearmanship for an actual battle. Although he looks childish he is a veteran in spear skills.’

His mouth slightly rose up.

Roan was stuffed with his own meaning.

‘I’m finally meeting Count Lancephil……….’

A person he had to meet someday, somehow.

That meeting occurred the moment he hadn’t expected, and suddenly.

When his stifling thoughts continued.

Kali yelled in a loud voice.

“It’s Count Io Lancephil!”

Not a barone, a baron, nor a viscount, but a count.

A noble with only five of its position.

The villagers of Whose village who couldn’t see Io as frequently as the residents of Pavor castle hurriedly got onto the floor.

And Roan was the same.

“Hohoho. Don’t do that.”

Io frowned and looked at Kali.

It was a really displeased look.

Kali clapped while having flinched.

Clap!

“Everyone stand up! There’s no need for that excessive mannerism!”

At those words, Roan and the others slowly stood up and attended politely.

Io looked at the goblin corpses in the surrounding area and nodded.

“The number of the goblins wasn’t low, but you blocked them well. Outstanding. Who’s the leader of the guards in this village?”

“It’s Gut.”

A polite posture and voice.

Io hit his shoulder himself and laughed.

“Hohoho. Amazing. You blocked the goblins really well.”

“Tha, thank you.”

Gut just put on a confused expression.

Then, Io called out Roan with hand signs.

“Come here.”

At those words Albert, Kali and the others turned to look at Roan.

Sights filled with amazement and curiosity.

Roan stood in front of Io with a null expression.

‘His body is strong and his balance is also good. It’s a really well built body.’

Io was amazed.

The Roan, when he looked closely, was different to when he saw him from afar.

“What’s your name?”

A lightly asked question.

Roan saluted and bowed.

“It’s class 5 adjutant Roan from Rose troop of the 7th corps.”

“Rose troop of the 7th corps? Roan?”

At the unexpected answer Io, Albert, the knights and the townspeople had surprised expressions.

Although the 7th corps was located on a region inside the territory of Count Lancephil, this village was quite far away.

‘Roan……..’

On top of that, he didn’t know why this name was so familiar to hear.

He slightly looked at Albert.

Eyes implying if he had heard of it.

‘Anyhow, can’t do anything about him.’

Albert smiled faintly and approached.

And fortunately, he knew a bit about Roan.

‘He’s someone that is putting his name in battle reports a lot. Although I never expected to meet him here.’

Albert slightly looked at Roan and whispered towards Io.

“He’s the one that planned the inundation tactic at Prely river and the soldier that slew Sedek. And recently, he executed a weird strategy and also slew Violin.”

“Ah!”

Io let out a low exclamation.

Only now did he remember.

‘Right. Class 5 adjutant Roan of Rose troop. I can remember now.’

The strange strategies and outstanding spearmanship he read in the reports; he was amazed every time.

Io smiled brightly and looked at Roan.

“So you were Roan. I know about your performances.”

“I was just lucky.”

He was not excessively humility.

“But what’s an adjutant of Rose troop doing over here?”

“I just finished my temporary retirement and was in the middle of returning.”

At Roan’s answer, Io smiled.

“That’s really good. We were also going to Ipen castle. How about traveling together?”

A sudden proposal.

Roan slightly raised his head and looked at Io.

‘Just the thing I wanted.’

He bowed once again.

“Yes. I will follow your wish.”

At those words, Io clapped with a joyful expression.

Clap.

“Good. Then we will be able to speak while traveling.”

He then called one knight over with a hand sign.

“Give one horse to Roan.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Soon, he came forward with an extra horse.

Roan stood up on the saddle with a quite experienced posture.

‘Oh. His posture is amazing.’

Io smiled faintly and nodded.

He had a kind look.

But contrary to Io, there was someone sending him a displeased look.

Kali Owells.

‘It’s displeasing.’

He didn’t like that Roan suddenly accompanied them at all.

He was a commoner and on top of that, a normal soldier and not a knight.

He wasn’t someone to fit in with him.

On top of that, he couldn’t forgive the face that he received all of Io’s interest.

His eyes naturally became fierce.

Roan felt that gaze and smiled bitterly.

‘So that person is Kali Owells.’

Although he couldn’t remember Walter Owells in the first place, he did remember things about Kali.

‘He did a really shocking thing in my last life.’

The person with the highest probabilities to become his first stepping stone.

That was Kali Owells.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“Then, shall we slowly depart?”

“Yes. Understood.”

Albert replied quickly and shook his hand.

Kali and the other knights reorganized their ranks.

Meanwhile, Io grabbed the hands of the villagers himself and consoled their surprised hearts.

Roan, who was looking at that, bit his lower lip.

‘Sir Count Io Lancephil……….’

The reason why he returned to the eastern regions even after having acquired the mana technique and the fighting manual.

That was related in a big way with Io who was in front of him.

Then, Albert’s voice was heard.

“We finished the preparations.”

At those words Io shook his hand of the people and got on the saddle.

“We are departing.”

A short order.

“Depart!”

Albert yelled in a loud voice while grabbing the reins.

Dudududu.

Then, the sound of horse step was heard clearly.

The hot wind became a bit cooler.

The heads of the horses were pointing towards the east.

A new story, new relations and a new future was over there.

To the north (4) End

Chapter 58




Outside the gates of Beno castle.

Pierce looked at the south while leaning on the thick walls.

‘It’s time for him to return…..’

He was forced to put on a casual expression but anxiety could be seen in his eyes.

‘Sir Adjutant Roan, when are you returning?’

It’s already been two months since Roan left for his temporary retirement.

And the 12th squad members were guarding outside the gates in shifts.

Then, a familiar voice was heard.

“Pierce!”

It was a pronunciation that was mixed with many notes.

Pierce knew the owner of the voice even without turning back.

‘Sir Viscount Reil Baker.’

He fixed his posture and looked at the place where the voice was heard from.

A middle aged man approached him from the insides of the gate while smiling brightly.

Just like Pierce’s guess, the owner of the voice was Reil.

“I wondered where you went without even training in the spear, but you really were here!”

A face filled with playfulness.

Pierce saluted him.

“Sir!”

“Don’t act that stiffly.”

Reil approached him and hit Pierce’s shoulder.

He looked at the widely spread scenery and shook his head.

“I think that today will be the same.”

At those words, Pierce looked towards the south.

Just like Reil’s words, you couldn’t see a trace of Roan.

But it was still too early to get disappointed.

“I’m planning to wait until the sun sets.”

“And what if he doesn’t come.”

“I will have to come tomorrow.”

“What if he doesn’t come tomorrow?”

“I will have to come the day after.”

“What if he doesn’t come the day after?”

Reil kept asking in succession.

Pierce took in a breath and replied in a calm voice.

“Then, I can come the day after that. Because tomorrow always comes.”

A powerful resolution.

Reil was astounded.

‘I heard that the 12th squad was only formed a few months ago, but to have this much trust and loyalty……’

Probably Pierce and the others of the 12th squad would keep waiting until the day Roan returned.

‘Roan. He’s someone that I want to meet the more I learn about him.’

It’s already been 10 days since he stayed at Beno castle.

In the meanwhile, he had heard many stories about Roan.

And especially about that, the most interesting one was related to Roan’s spear skills.

‘At first, I thought that he just taught him what he knew.’

But while conversing with Pierce, he realized that that wasn’t everything.

‘Roan spearmanship…..’

He would have to ask him the precise things himself, but if it’s true that Roan made it himself…

‘It means that he’s a genius among geniuses.’

Even Reil lasted 10 years until he first made a spearmanship.

Even for Reil, it took him almost 10 years until to make his own spearmanship technique.

‘Is it already time to put down the title of spear genius?’

He didn’t have any frustration.

Rather, his heart pumped faster because of the expectation.

‘Roan. I will wait for you here. Be it one day, two days, ten days or a month.’

He had that resolution.

‘Instead, you have to spar with me every time I want to.’

His mouth slightly raised up.

Perhaps it was because he wanted Roan to return quickly, but his eyes kept staring at the south.

Then.

‘Huh?’

Reil sharpened his eyes.

Because a dust cloud arose from the end of the plains.

‘A knight squad?’

It was still difficult to identify them precisely because they were still far away.

Then, Pierce’s voice was heard.

“They seem like knights.”

At those words Reil frowned.

“You, you can see that?”

“Yes.”

Pierce nodded with a calm expression.

Reil was astounded.

‘He can see that far at this distance? This guy certainly isn’t a normal one either.’

Because of Roan, he was a bit overshadowed by him, but Pierce’s talent was also excellent.

‘Although I can’t judge Roan’s talent before I personally meet him, the talent of this guy……’

Reil slightly bit his lower lip.

‘He’s more amazing than me.’

He had a kind of proud feeling.

He felt like he became rich.

‘For now, did I at least acquire one?’

If perhaps Roan’s talent was not that good, he had to at least acquire Pierce.

‘It’s slowly time to raise a disciple.’

The thing every noble wanted from him.

For the spear genius Reil Baker to train a disciple.

However Reil put out every kind of excuse until now and pretended not to know about that.

But looking at the shining talents Pierce had, he slowly felt that he wanted to raise a disciple.

‘If on top of this, Roan has a more outstanding talent………’

His mouth slightly rose up.

Meanwhile, the knights came quite close.

“They certainly seem like knights.”

Shining armors.

Only then could Reil identify them.

Dudududu.

Horse steps shaking the ground was heard.

Now, the knights were so close you could check their faces.

“Huh?!”

It was a surprised expression.

Reil let out a low exclamation.

“Count Lancephil?!”

The old man leading the knights.

He certainly was Io.

Only after he arrived at Ipen castle did Io get to know that Reil and Aaron were at Beno castle.

He didn’t rest a moment and went towards Beno castle.

“Hohoho! Viscount Reil Baker!”

Io, who arrived at the gates, discovered Reil and laughed.

“Greetings to Count Io Lancephil.”

Reil hurriedly bowed.

Pierce was also nervous as he was tense

Io slowly got off the horse and grabbed Reil’s hands.

“It hurt my feelings that you declined all the invitations I sent you until now.”

“I’m sorry. As I concentrated on training, I lacked the time to go to other places.”

“Right. Right. There’s nothing more important than focusing on your training.”

Io had a satisfied expression and nodded.

And then, said as if he was whispering.

“But what did you come all the way to Beno castle for?”

At those words Reil smiled bitterly.

“Actually, there’s someone I wanted to meet at all cos……”

When he talked up to that point.

“Huh? Huh? Huh?”

Pierce’s voice was heard.

A really perplexed look.

“Hm?”

Reil frowned and looked at Pierce.

Eyes implying what happened.

Pierce pointed at the knights.

Precisely, it was at the back of the knights wearing flashy armor.

There was a youth wearing a shabby and normal outfit.

Pierce yelled with all his voice.

“Sir Adjutant Roan!”

Roan had finally finished his retirement and returned to Beno castle.

And with the big shot noble Io Lancephil.

*****

‘Is this really a scene in my office?’

Gale was astounded.

For the past 10 days, Reil and Aaron had stayed in the headquarters of his troop, but even so there was no instance he felt as short of breath as he did now.

‘Count Io Lancephil.’

The pressure a count gave you was amazing.

Reil, who was always free and full of playfulness was also a bit nervous.

‘There’s Count Io Lancephil, Viscount Reil Baker, and Corps Commander Aaron Tate in this small and shabby office.’

The reason why they gathered here.

Gale slightly turned his head to look at Roan.

‘He’s becoming more of a big shot every time.’

A proud and uneasy feeling.

‘It feels like he would leave far away like this.’

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“Hohoho. So Viscount Baker has come to meet Roan.”

He looked at Roan and nodded.

‘He certainly is a kid to have interest in.’

Io conversed about many things with Roan while traveling to Beno castle.

‘His thoughts on strategies and tactics were so deep and clear to the point you wouldn’t believe he’s an 18 year old.’

Abilities you had to have to become a good commander.

‘On top of that, his spear skills are also good.’

He remembered the sight of Roan massacring 100 goblins in Whose village by himself.

Io, then looked at Reil.

“So, how does it feel after you met him yourself?”

At that moment, a strange silence fell on the office.

Reil put a weird smile on and looked at Roan.

‘His body is really good. He has great balance.’

But there was a limit as to what he could see with his eyes.

The smile on his mouth became denser.

“Roan.”

A gently calling sound.

Reil moved his feet and faced Roan.

Naturally, the sights of everyone gathered on him.

Gulp.

A nervous feeling to the point where it was weird.

Reil hit Roan’s chest.

“Spar with me.”

A really unshapely and direct battle proposition.

“Hohoho.”

Io laughed.

‘To abruptly propose for a spar. Although Roan’s skills and talent are outstanding in the end, he’s a normal soldier. For Roan, who’s a normal soldier, to face the best spearman like you……..’

When he thought up to that point.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“Yes. Understood.”

He had a calm and clear attitude.

Everyone’s eyes turned wide.

Even Reil was a bit surprised.

‘Look at this guy.’

His mouth rose.

‘He doesn’t have any hesitation?’

It was pleasurable.

This was the first case.

His body moved.

“Really? Then let’s go to the training field right now.”

Reil walked one step ahead with an excited look.

Roan followed his back without saying anything.

After the two people left, an awkward silence fell in the office.

“Hohoho.”

The thing that broke the silence was Io’s laughter.

“We will see a good spectacle.”

He smiled faintly and moved.

Only then did Aaron, Gale, the knights and the adjutants start to move.

‘A spar so suddenly?’

‘Will Roan be able to face him?’

Even if Roan’s talent was outstanding, he wasn’t an opponent for Reil.

Everyone thought like that.

Even so, there was some kind of expectation in Aaron’s and Gale’s hearts.

‘What if Roan wins……?’

The two looked at each other coincidentally.

Aaron and Gale understood their thoughts and laughed awkwardly.

And then they shook their heads.

‘But even so, it’s impossible to beat Viscount Reil Baker.’

That was the most normal and correct judgement.

The steps of the both of them directed to the training field that was at the back of the troop headquarters.

*****

Roan and Reil.

The two of them were facing each other while holding wooden sticks used for training.

The surrounding was filled with the soldiers of rose troop that heard the notices and came running.

Swish.

Roan and Reil took their stances while being five steps away from each other.

‘It’s a clear posture without flaws.’

Reil looked at Roan’s posture and was amazed.

‘But the feeling is somewhat strange.’

A feeling he couldn’t express with words.

To find an exact expression.

‘It kind of feels like it gets blurry.’

The sun that shined, the wind that blew, and the trees that slightly shook.

It felt like Roan permeated himself in the scenery and became blurry.

It was a state that was easy to lose his presence if you didn’t concentrate.

‘If I slip, the stick may hit my stomach.’

Reil took in a deep breath.

His five senses became sharper.

Actually, the reason why Roan’s presence and intent became blurry was because of Brent’s ring.

‘I have Brent’s ring with me but…….’

Roan looked at Reil and was astounded.

Reil certainly didn’t have any artifacts on him.

The casual outfit and a shabby wooden stick was everything.

But even so, the intent in his eyes was very strange.

The tip of the stick emanated a frightening and sharp intent, but aside from that he couldn’t feel anything from his body.

Just like.

‘It feels like only the stick is floating in the air.’

Reil was certainly tens of times stronger than Roan while solely looking at spear skills.

But even so, there was a reason in which Roan could accept the sparring petition with a calm and composed attitude.

‘There was a time when Viscount Reil Baker and Pierce sparred in my past life.’

But of course the time and situation were all different.

In his past life it occurred exactly after 1 year, when Pierce showed his skills in the battle of Int forest and Reil came to see him.

At that time, Roan was training with Pierce and because of that he could check everything next to him.

‘That day is just like today. There was Count Lancephil and Viscount Baker hit Pierce’s chest and asked him to spar once.’

Although the time was pulled and the concerned person was him and not Roan, but the start of the battle was the same.

This made him think of the past Int forest battle.

‘A future that’s different in time and situation but the structure itself is the same.’

This battle could be the same kind of future as the battle of Int forest.

‘If perhaps, my guess is true………’

He thought of the battle in his past life.

He clearly remembered the conversation and the contents they had just like it was yesterday.

The day his and Pierce’s life perfectly split.

They were memories he couldn’t forget even if he wanted to.

Roan gripped the spear tightly.

Grip.

He felt the rough texture of the wood.

‘Last time, everyone expected for an overwhelming victory on part of Viscount Baker.’

Then the results?

‘Just like their expectations, Viscount Reil Baker obtained an overwhelming victory………’

Pierce from back then, was a normal spearman and didn’t even know mana, but regardless of that they sparred for fifty blows.

‘Although Viscount Baker faced him in quite a relaxed manner, it was a really shocking result.’

Because of that Pierce could become Reil’s disciple.

A duke and supreme commander of Rinse kingdom.

The start of that road was the spar against Reil.

‘On top of that, aside from victory and defeat, I can’t miss the opportunity to spar against the best spearman in the country.’

The spar Roan was thinking about could be completely different to the one in his memories.

But even so, he really wanted to spar with him.

‘Because I didn’t even have the chance to do so in my past life.’

Roan looked at Reil fixedly.

‘If perhaps, this spar is the one that will happen the next year just like my guess………’

Calmness sank into his eyes.

‘Viscount Baker will laugh brightly……’

And surprisingly, Reil smiled brightly as if he was waiting.

‘Then he said, ‘Shall I check your skills?’

When he thought like that.

“Then, Shall I check your skills?”

Reil’s voice was heard.

A look that coincided with Roan’s thoughts.

‘Ah……’

Roan forcefully gulped down the exclamation.

His guess was right.

This spar was certainly the one Reil and Pierce did in his past life.

‘Why are you still? Are you scared? Then, should I move first?’

His memory was clear.

“Why are you still? Are you scared? Then, should I move first?”

There wasn’t even one mistake.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘From now on, the spear comes piercing against my body. But that’s a feint. Actually, he’s looking to attack my left foot.’

Not differently, Reil bent his left knee slightly and quickly stabbed with his stick.

A really strong and quick stabbing.

Roan focused on the wooden stick and his wrist.

The wrist that slightly twisted in front of his stomach.

At the same time, the end of the spear fell towards the ground.

‘It’s the same as my past life.’

Roan hurriedly pulled back his left foot.

Tang!

Reil’s spear hit the ground.

“Oho! You are good?”

A humorous voice.

However, amazement was seen in Reil’s eyes.

‘You dodged this?’

His mouth slightly rose.

‘Then, should I play earnestly?’

Reil smiled brightly once more and swung his spear.

Roan fell back and lowered his body.

The trace of the spear filled his sight.

But he didn’t become astounded.

‘Although it’s not that I remember all the attacks…….’

He remembered the first and the last 50th attack clearly.

‘If Pierce from back then could face him, then the me from right now also can.’

At least, the Roan from now was stronger than Pierce from back then.

On top of that, if his guess was right Reil wouldn’t even have put strength into his attacks.

‘I just have to endure until the 50th blow.’

The last blow Roan was thinking about was the 51st one.

It was the next blow which Pierce couldn’t block and was done in.

A new start (1) End

Chapter 59




Spat!

A sharp sound.

Tak! Tadak! Tadak! Tak!

Continued by that, sounds of heavy blows were heard.

The hard wooden sticks for practice split the air without stopping.

‘Is, is it even?’

‘Roan has equal skills with Viscount Reil Baker?’

The soldiers surrounding the practice field opened their eyes roundly.

They also knew that Roan’s spear skills were outstanding.

But his opponent was the best spearman in Rinse kingdom and the one called spear genius.

“Ey. Viscount Baker is going easy on him.”

The mumblings of a soldier.

The soldiers around him nodded unconsciously.

Meanwhile, the battle was facing its conclusion.

Reil’s stick twisted like a snake and tried to stab Roan’s side.

It was a fast and strange attack.

However Roan wasn’t perplexed.

He stamped the floor with the stick and twisted his upper body to the side.

Spat!

Reil’s stick missed its target and stabbed the empty air.

Roan hit the stick that was on the ground with the back of his feet as if he was waiting for it.

Paat!

The stick drew a line along with sharp sound and surged up to attack Reil’s chin.

‘He’s good.’

Reil smiled at Roan’s sharp attack and took one step back.

Spat!

Roan’s stick passed in front of his nose.

A movement just enough to barely dodge the stick.

It was the perfect distance.

‘Amazing.’

Roan was astounded.

Reil was really relaxed even in the middle of this fierce battle.

‘Having looked at him from the side and facing him directly is certainly different.’

In his past life, the confrontation between Reil and Pierce, where he watched from the sideline, was as beautiful as a dance.

The spear drew lines and the both of them repeated closing in and backing up.

The sound of the sticks hitting each other and cutting through the air was heard as music.

‘That was the day I saw Pierce’s real look, which I couldn’t see because I was too close.’

In his past life, Roan and Pierce started together from the training camp and spent 2 years together.

At first, Roan took care of the shy and timid Pierce.

Although all the trainers and the seniors of the troop raised their thumbs saying that Pierce’s talent was the best, at that time Roan was full of confidence.

‘I also thought that there was nothing I couldn’t do.’

However, everything changed after meeting Reil.

Pierce, who was shy and timid, became one of the most influential people that would be able to lead the kingdom’s future after the confrontation against Reil.

Pierce became Reil’s disciple just like that and left his side.

And.

‘When we met again he became a vice corps commander, and I was still a normal spearman.’

Roan and Pierce.

The lives of the two people, who were almost equal, started to change after this confrontation.

‘That’s why I can’t forget it even if I want to.’

He had a bitter smile.

Roan bit his lower lip.

He wasn’t in a situation to be reminiscing about things from the past.

The attacks continued without letting him rest.

‘My breath is getting heavy.’

If there seemed to be a weak point, Reil’s stick closed in on it stubbornly.

Tak! Tadak! Tak!

A light sound.

It certainly was a difficult situation, but Roan didn’t get pushed back.

No, rather, he was even with Reil.

Although he couldn’t use the mana because of the gazes of other people, with Kalian’s tear and his strong body, the tip of the stick moved sharply and elegantly.

Spat!

Roan’s spear cut through the air and started to make big movements.

He was now executing Pierce’s spearmanship, which was now Roan’s spearmanship.

‘So this is Roan’s spearmanship.’

Reil’s mouth slightly rose up.

‘It certainly is different than what Pierce executed.’

Even if Pierce was a genius, it had only been two months since he started training in Roan’s spearmanship.

Compared to that, Roan already had more than 10 years.

His spear twisted and looked for Reil’s: arms, legs, stomach, private parts and joints.

Everything was deadly and vital.

‘Kugh.’

Reil grinded his teeth for the first time.

It was because Roan’s attack was much sharper than what he had initially thought.

‘If I keep being relaxed, I might face an embarrassing situation?’

Reil put strength in his grip and charged forward.

His defensive attacks changed to become offensive ones.

Tang! Tadang!

Even the sound of the clashes became different.

‘Kugh.’

Every time the spears clashed, his palm became numb.

‘He’s planning to end it now.’

Roan grinded his teeth.

The number of blows had already reached 40.

‘Whew!’

Roan let out a long sigh.

Actually for him, this battle had much meaning.

‘From the many futures, there’s one that always happens, no matter what I do.’

Int’s forest battle was like that, and this battle was also the same.

‘In the battle of Int forest, the time and the troops participating were different than my past life……..’

When the orc that came charging forward but fell because of a branch, it coincided perfectly with his past life.

Although it seems like I have the advantage because I know the future, the events are….

Reality wasn’t like that at all.

‘What if there aren’t changes even in the results?’

What if the ones that should die, died, and the ones who should live, lived?

What if everything flowed like a preconceived result?

What if in the end, he ends up dying in the battlefield just like his past life?

‘The results of right now has no meaning at all.’

But of course, it wasn’t that the future had to happen as he knew it.

The slightly different future just like the Prely river battle, and Slen battle that weren’t in the future at all.

‘If my guess is correct……….’

In the future he would face from now on, there would be many of these types of cases.

The cases he knew in the future, and the same cases.

Slightly different cases.

Completely different cases.

Cases he didn’t know about, etc.

Various different types of the future were mixed together causing uncertainty and were also approaching closer.

‘Because of that, I don’t know if the situations that I am aware of will happen exactly like in my past life.’

That’s why he wanted to check it.

When Reil requested a battle after hitting his chest.

‘I really got my act together.’

The battle against Reil and Pierce that he remembered.

The start of it was certainly the same.

‘Will I be able to change the results of this battle?’

If he could, there was no need to be afraid of the incoming future.

‘I can’t keep relying on the future I know.’

On top of that, the thing called the future was really uncertain.

He was at a point where he could rely on it passively but had to actively take the initiative.

Because of that, this battle against Reil was really important.

‘I will crush all the different futures where the results are already pre-determined.’

Then, a sharp sound was heard.

Spat!

The spear drew a line and flew towards him.

Roan took two steps back and twisted his wrist.

Tang!

The spears collided against each other.

“Amazing. I had quite the fun time, sparring.”

This was Reil’s voice.

Roan gritted his teeth.

“Block this one too.”

They were some lightly tossed words.

The battle was coming to an end.

In his past life, Pierce couldn’t block the last attack and lost.

‘I will block it. I will block it and change the future.’

Roan opened his two eyes abruptly.

Paat!

In that instant, the surrounding scenery and spar became slow in Roan’s eyes.

Meanwhile, only Reil showed any fast movements.

Spaaaaaat!

The spear closed in while it cut through the air.

He could see that the tip of the spear vibrated in all directions.

At first glance it seemed like it was aiming for his stomach but actually it was a continuous attack followed by the two thighs, sides, and back.

Roan glared at the tip of his spear and turned his body.

Everything was really slow to the point where he yawned.

At the same time, Reil’s spear lowered and aimed for the thigh.

‘Hph!’

Roan took in a breath and charged forward.

Spaaaaaat!

Reil’s spear slightly grazed Roan’s thigh.

But the attack didn’t end there.

Tuk.

The spear stopped like it was all a lie, surged up, and then twisted.

It was a movement aimed at the sides.

‘Quicker!’

Roan felt trapped because of his slow movements.

He turned his body and closed in on Reil.

A perplexed look could be seen on Reil.

Taaaaat!

Roan passed by Reil’s body like that and made it to his back. At the same time, he tried to kick Reil’s ankle. The movement was executed perfectly and everything flowed together.

‘It’s done!’

A faint smile appeared on Roan’s face.

Then!

Reil’s two feet, that were solidly stuck to the ground, started to float in the air.

‘Impossible!’

Roan looked at himself kicking the empty air and frowned.

He thought that it was the perfect attack.

‘What kind of reaction is this fast!’

Then, he felt a pain as if someone was poking his eyes with a needle.

It was because he had used Kalian’s tear over-excessively.

However, Roan endured it and swung his spear.

Paaaat!

The spear moved through the air very slowly.

After a while.

Puuuuuk!

The tip of the spear hit Reil’s back.

‘Kugh!’

Only then did Roan blink once.

Pat!

At that moment, the scenery that was slow until now returned to its original speed.

Tat!

Reil, who jumped to the air, turned his body with the spear.

He made some distance with Roan in an instant.

“Kugh.”

Pain was felt in his back.

‘What the hell just happened?’

Reil frowned.

He executed one of his own spearmanship techniques that he had saved to finish the spar.

He thought that with Roan’s skills he would be able to either dodge or block the attack that was aimed for the thigh.

‘But I thought that he would fall by the following attack.’

His guess was wrong in a way that was good to see.

But it wasn’t to the point it completely slipped away from him.

Roan showed quick movements to the point that it was surprising and then closed in on Reil.

At the same time, he turned his body. After that he was at his back he tried to kick him.

Reil kicked the ground and jumped away instinctively.

However, he couldn’t block the attack that followed.

‘If this was a real battle, my back would have deep cut into it.’

Reil glanced at Roan.

‘I can’t measure his skills.’

He thought that he had measured Roan’s skills to a certain point during the spar.

But the moment he thought of the last attack, Roan showed skills beyond his estimation.

He was truly amazed.

“Are you also able to blo…….”

The moment that he was planning to compliment him.

Pat!

Roan charged through and faced him with a fierce intent.

‘Kugh!’

Reil gulped some air and raised his spear.

Offense and defense happened again.

From now on, it was something Roan also faced for the first time.

It was a battle that didn’t happen in his past life.

‘I’m changing the results!’

Just because the situation changed a bit, he couldn’t be relieved.

This was because the future was still uncertain.

‘A blitz warfare!’

From now on, he couldn’t use Kalian’s tear for a while.

Tak! Tadak! Tak!

The clashing sounds filled the training room.

The fierce attacks continued.

“Amazing.”

Io mumbled with a surprised expression.

The people around him nodded in agreement.

They were surprised at two things.

The first, obviously was Reil’s spear skills.

‘The skills of Viscount Baker is really famous…..’

But what was even more surprising was Roan’s spear skills.

‘For the skills of an 18 year old spearman to be this high.’

Io was amazed.

A faint expectation appeared in his face.

‘The one who will continue the legacy of Viscount Baker, no, he may become a commander that surpasses him.’

Io’s mouth slightly rose up.

‘If he teaches him well from now on, he will certainly…….’

The deeper his thoughts grew, the closer the battle approached the climax.

Roan put strength into his grip.

‘Let’s end it with this.’

He was planning on executing the 7th stance of Roan’s spearmanship.

This was the strong technique that stabbed the spear on Violin’s side.

‘Hph!’

He took in a deep breath.

The muscles on both of his arms swelled.

Spat!

The spear split the wind.

At the same time, the entire spear moved to the sides.

‘Is this also Roan’s spearmanship?’

Reil looked at the gorgeously moving spear, to the point that it made him dizzy, and smiled.

He wasn’t certain if he was aiming for the left or the right because of the big movements.

‘Is it the left or the right?’

Reil glared at the tip of the spear and then twisted his wrist.

The place he tried to block was his left side.

Then.

Tung!

The spear hit the air as if it was flicking along a heavy sound.

The tip of the spear suddenly changed trajectory and came carving into Reil’s right side.

‘Amazing!’

It was an extraordinary change.

Reil hurriedly pulled back his spear and twisted his body.

Then.

‘Kugh!’

He felt a pain in his back.

‘Damn………’

He was surprised with Roan’s attack.

Because of this moment’s discomfort, his movements were slow.

‘My ribs will be smashed.’

Reil bit his lower lip.

At this state, he wouldn’t be able to block the spear, nor dodge it.

‘Roan. I’m sorry but I can’t do anything about it.’

He bitterly smiled and took in a deep breath.

In that instant, a soft feeling surged up from his stomach.

Paaaat!

At the same time, the spear split the air at an amazing speed.

Reil’s spear hit Roan’s spear.

Pagak!

A sharp sound.

Roan’s spear broke in a way that was easy to see.

“Kugh!”

Roan grinded his teeth at the amazing shock that was felt and quickly spread out from his palms.

But even so, he didn’t let go of his spear.

‘Is it mana……?’

He guessed the identity of the strength that surged up from his body in an instant.

“Kugh.”

His body trembled.

Viscount Baker showed his amazing strength, worthy of being a man of his reputation.

‘So this is Viscount Reil Baker’s real strength.’

The difference in having mana and not having mana was certainly big.

‘What would have happened if I also used the Flamdor mana technique?’

He would have succeeded in that last attack.

Regret was left.

‘But even so, I have to hide my mana.’

He had just started training in it.

If he made a mistake and rumours spread, he would have his mana technique taken away from him even before he reached the peak.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh.

‘Does it end like this……?’

Roan looked at his broken spear and shook his head.

Then, Reil’s voice was heard.

“I’m sorry.”

He bitterly smiled and slowly walked up.

And surprisingly enough, he slightly bowed.

“It’s my defeat.”

This was a sudden declaration of defeat.

The soldiers who were around the training ground had surprised expressions on their faces.

“He lost?”

“Viscount Reil Baker lost?”

“Impossible!”

They couldn’t understand.

The one with the broken spear was Roan and not Reil.

On the other side Io, Aaron, the knights, and etc. nodded at Reil’s declaration of defeat.

‘He even used mana while facing a normal soldier, so it’s right that it’s his defeat.’

Io had a faint smile and nodded his head.

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

They didn’t know the truth; Roan was currently learning a mana technique.

‘Even so, he’s the real thing.’

Io’s sight moved to Roan.

He had the skills to evenly fight against the spear genius Reil, and the outstanding strategies and tactics he showed in the battles.

‘He said he was only 18. Then……..’

Many plans were being set up in his head.

On the other side, Roan was a bit perplexed at Reil’s sudden defeat declaration.

“No. The one that lost is m……….”

Roan, who was raising his broken spear, staggered.

It seemed like the mana Reil put in his body still remained inside him.

Reil hurriedly grabbed Roan’s hand and supported him.

“The internal shock would have been greater.”

Reil awkwardly smiled and grabbed Roan’s wrist.

He was planning to calm his interior when it was a mess.

“I’m, i’m fin………”

Roan hurriedly tried to pull away his wrist, but he couldn’t beat Reil’s strength.

Then.

“Huh?!”

Reil, who was inserting mana through the tip of his finger, had a surprised expression and looked at Roan.

And then, he shook his head as if it was astonishing.

“You were more of an amazing guy than what I initially thought.”

He whispered in a really low voice in Roan’s ear.

“I will keep it a secret for now.”

Roan bitterly smiled.

Because he knew what Reil was talking about.

“Instead, you will have to speak with me.”

Roan just nodded instead of replying back.

Reil was still holding onto his wrist.

And then, he was astounded.

‘A normal soldier is accumulating mana inside his body?’

Reil fixedly looked into Roan’s eyes.

‘He gets funnier the more I know about him.’

He had a thought that the things that would happen from now on, they were going to even more fun.

And that feeling got it exactly right.

Chapter 60




“Waaaa!”

The training field was just like a celebratory party.

The soldiers, who were watching at the spar while holding their breaths, couldn’t hold it any more and yelled.

Even if Reil was considered a hero in Rinse kingdom, Roan was their fellow soldier and a good friend.

That’s why they could only get excited at Reil’s declaration of defeat.

“Waaa! Certainly, sir adjutant Roan!”

“Roan! Roan! Roan! Roan! “

“Waaa! Sir adjutant Roan was my predecessor!”

“Kuha! He certainly is the pride of our 13th squad!”

“I knew that he would become big!”

The people with the biggest voices even in the middle of the cheering, they were the 13th squad that served with Roan before it became the 12th squad.

Vice squad commander Austin of the 12th squad and the commander of the 13th squad, Tane, were shaking hands while they were beaming.

“Wuooooooo! Roan! Roan! Roan! Roan! “

The noisiest one was Pete, of the 13th squad.

He cheered Roan with a voice as loud as his body was big.

“You sure are popular.”

Reil smiled brightly and hit Roan’s shoulder.

Roan just smiled awkwardly instead of replying back.

Then Aaron, Gale, etc., approached him with Io at the front.

“It was an amazing spar.”

Io complemented Reil first and then looked at Roan.

It kind of felt like he wasn’t interested in Reil.

‘For the man that sang the Baker, Baker, Baker song to be like that……..’

Albert, who was looking at the sides, was astounded.

“Roan. It really was an amazing fight.”

“Thank you.”

Roan bowed deeply.

‘Kugh.’

As the internal shock wasn’t completely gone, the state of his body wasn’t that good.

‘If Viscount Baker showed all of his skills……..’

He knew that Reil had held himself back in this fight.

If he didn’t do so, this battle wouldn’t have flowed in a normal way in the first place.

“Rest for now, and then let’s talk.”

Io was very leisurely and benign.

‘What’s more precious and doesn’t return is time. And rather than that time, he’s someone I don’t want to let go.’

Roan was someone he didn’t want to let go.

‘Perhaps even more so than Viscount Baker.’

His mouth slightly rose up.

“Roan! Roan! Roan! Roan! “

“Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose!”

The soldiers surrounding the training field yelled with all of their strength.

Now, for them, Roan was a hero as amazing as Reil.

But of course he still had many things to do until he became a real hero.

*****

Roan could stay in a lodging all alone because of Gale’s efforts.

When he was still settling down in his imperfect interior, footsteps were heard outside the door.

‘He came.’

Roan put his mana in order and stood up.

As he stood in front of the entrance, the sounds of the footsteps stopped.

Kiiig.

The creaking of the wood was heard when the door opened.

“Oh! You were waiting for me?”

It was a familiar voice.

It was Reil.

He closed the door and walked in.

“How’s your body?”

At the question, Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

“I’m fine.”

At that instant, Reil checked him with his eyes.

“You are okay? Does that mean that things such as my spearmanship isn’t that much?”

“N, no.”

As Roan shook his head with a perplexed expression, Reil burst out in laughter.

“Hahahaha. It’s a joke. A joke.”

And then, he sat down in a chair.

“Then, shall we talk?”

Reil had a weird expression.

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan sat at the opposite side and nodded.

“You learned mana, right?”

Reil, went directly to the point.

Roan replied with a calm expression.

“Yes. I did.”

“So I was right.”

Reil put on a faint smile.

He looked at Roan while crossing his arms.

“It hasn’t been that long since you learned it?”

“Yes. It’s been about a month.”

“Then that means that you learned it during your retirement.”

The smile on Reil’s face became even bigger.

Roan just looked at Reil’s eyes.

‘Is it time he asked me how I learned it?……….’

He had already prepared an answer in advance.

‘I learned it from a retired soldier.’

It was the answer he used when Tane, the commander of the 13th squad, asked him where he learned his spear skills after he observed Roan.

The first time it was about fate helping by giving him a retired soldier who taught him the spear in his childhood. This time it was about him learning mana.

But rather because it was too obvious, there was no space to doubt it.

‘How many retired soldiers, knights, and powerful hidden people are there…….’

But of course, learning spear skills and mana from one of those people was quite a scarce difficult thing to actually do.

But even so, it wasn’t impossible.

‘Now, ask me quickly.’

Roan was prepared to answer.

However, Reil just spat out strange words.

“But your mana technique is quite peculiar.”

“Yes?”

“I don’t know it well but it feels like it’s not stable.”

When he grabbed Roan’s wrist to calm down the internal shock, Reil could certainly feel it.

‘It had a feeling like many different natures were mixed into it.’

But what was fortunate was that one energy was really rough and active and the other energy was was calm and still.

Because of that, the energies weren’t hitting or clashing against each other yet.

‘Was it originally this kind of mana?’

Reil looked at Roan well.

And Roan also had a confused face.

‘It seems like he’s not even conscious of it. Then, that means that it’s not that big of a problem…….’

Reil took in a deep breath.

If by chance the energies collided against each other, it may not simply end at him losing his mana.

‘He may become disabled.’

Roan, who has outstanding talent, become disabled?

Reil wanted to block at least that much.

“How did you learn the mana technique?”

It was a question thrown out to exactly grasp the situation that doesn’t have any rebellious intent.

Roan brought forth the answer that he had prepared.

“I learned it from a retired soldier.”

For a while, Roan narrated the story that he had created a while ago.

Reil slowly nodded.

‘I don’t know the skills of that retired soldier, but the mana technique may be unstable by itself.’

He bit his lower lip.

‘I will have to keep checking up on him for now.’

There was nothing that he could do right now.

Reil forced a laugh and looked at Roan.

“Then, Roan’s spearmanship is also……?”

“Yes. I learned it from the retired soldier. As it didn’t have a name, I put in my name.”

Roan shyly laughed and bowed.

‘Pierce, i’m sorry.’

But even so it was Roan that had some considerations.

“I would also like to meet that retired soldier once.”

Looking at the level of Roan’s spearmanship and the fact that he had learned mana from him, he certainly wouldn’t be an ordinary soldier.

His warrior’s curiosity surged up.

“I’m sorry. He tends to move around quite a bit so I don’t know his precise location.”

“Hm. Can’t do anything about it then.”

Reil shook his hand as if it was okay and nodded.

It was up to there.

Reil didn’t ask anymore about questions related to the mana or the spear.

‘There’s no need to ask anymore.’

In the first place, this was what Reil’s personality was like.

The current state was what was important and not who taught him, when, where and how.

On top of that.

“I will keep it a secret for now.”

He decided to keep his mouth shut about Roan learning mana.

‘There’s no need for me to spread it when he himself is trying to hide it. On top of that, he has just started to learn it. If rumours were to spread, he may be targeted by people that wanted the mana technique.’

But there was only one thing he had to be certain about.

‘The possibility of being a spy.’

But that possibility was really low.

‘According to the words of Duke Tate, he had already investigated him once.’

But even if he was still uneasy, he just had to check the information of the kingdom or ask a request to the thieves guild.

Reil looked at Roan.

‘Whatever it is, it would be good if he grew quickly.’

His thoughts were rather fixed in a weird way.

‘Only then will we be able to spar again.’

Reil was a real warrior.

He was expecting for Roan’s mana technique and spear skills to grow a lot more compared to now.

‘I was too bored until now.’

There weren’t many opponents for him in Rinse kingdom.

The knights and magicians didn’t suit him in temperament or what they did.

‘Even so……’

He felt regret.

“It’s regrettable.”

His thoughts popped up unconsciously.

“What is?”

As Roan carefully asked, Reil let out a short sigh.

“Whew. Because you learned another mana technique……”

His last words dimmed a bit.

Roan just waited for the next words.

“I can’t formally take you in as a disciple.”

Reil smacked his lips.

“It’s really something to say this right in front of you but I quite like you.”

But of course, that wasn’t the only reason.

‘If I taught him myself, he would be able to grow more quickly.’

Then, he would be able to properly battle a little bit quicker. But he couldn’t formally take in someone who learned another mana technique, as a disciple of the Baker family.

“Ah……..”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

‘Did I get recognized by Viscount Reil Baker?’

A corner of his heart became numb with pride.

In his past life, he couldn’t even get a glance from Reil.

But right now, Reil wanted to take him in as a formal disciple.

Reil continued speaking.

“Because formal disciples of the Baker family have to learn the Baker mana technique.”

Roan just nodded.

Becoming a formal disciple of a family meant that the first thing you had to do was to learn the traditional mana technique of the family.

But although not every family was like that, that was the common practice and custom.

“But even if that’s the case, I can’t ask you to forget the mana technique you already learned.”

Reil smacked his lips.

Roan put on a smile.

‘I can’t give up on the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid. And…………’

His eyes became calm.

‘Even if that wasn’t the case, I can’t become your disciple.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

In the first place, he wasn’t planning on becoming his disciple.

No, precisely speaking he couldn’t.

‘I can’t leave this place for the moment.’

Roan had many things he had to do from now on.

He had to have a solid start for his future actions.

They were very important things.

‘I don’t know if you would stay here and teach me yourself……’

It was impossible to leave for Reil’s territory.

But even so, Reil also couldn’t keep roaming around in the eastern territory of the kingdom while leaving his own territory empty.

In the end it became a situation where Roan couldn’t become Reil’s disciple.

“Regrettable. Too regrettable.”

Reil continued to smack his lips and shook his head.

Then, Roan’s mouth slightly rose up.

‘Should I tell him now?’

The solid starting point for the future.

And it was one of the most important things even amongst them.

Roan whispered in a low voice.

“If it is okay with you, may I recommend you a soldier?”

“Recommend?”

Reil had an interested expression.

‘Mmm. Recommend………’

He had already checked his outstanding abilities but he didn’t know about his eyes in judging people.

‘Well, it isn’t bad to hear you out for now.’

Reil slowly nodded.

Roan brightly smiled and continued saying.

“The soldier I want to recommend……..”

Strength was put in his voice.

“Is spearman Pierce from rose troop of the 7th corps.”

*****

“No! I don’t want to!”

It was a rough voice and one with a firm attitude.

You could see in Pierce’s attitude and expression his absolute intention to decline.

“Pierce. Do you know just how amazing of an opp………”

Roan said as if he was easing him up but.

“I don’t want to. I don’t want to leave your side.”

Pierce cut off his words right from the start.

Roan had a troubled expression on his face.

It was an expression of various mixed emotions.

‘It’s stifling but at the same time proud.’

Looking at Pierce wanting to remain at his side whatever happened, he really felt great.

But even so, he couldn’t leave him at his side.

‘Pierce. You have to become Viscount Baker’s disciple.’

Roan was planning to send Pierce towards Reil.

‘And fortunately, the viscount also sees you in a good light.’

It was after Reil had personally checked Pierce’s talent in the 10 days he spent at Beno castle.

He was rather surprised and happy as his thoughts coincided with Roan’s.

‘There’s no way for Viscount Baker to not recognize your skills.’

Roan pulled up Pierce who had a cold and hard expression and sat him down in the chair in front of him.

“Pierce.”

He called out in a low calling voice.

Pierce just turned his head away instead of replying back.

It meant that he didn’t want to talk.

‘I also have it more comfortable if you are by my side.’

Pierce was picked to be the one with the best talent in all of history.

He became a supreme commander after having climbed up to become a duke in his past life.

He was one of the existences that lead Rinse kingdom to prominence.

That existence was Pierce.

He really wanted to leave him by his side and take care of him so that no one could steal him away from Roan.

However, he wouldn’t be able to make Pierce’s real talent bloom that way.

‘You have to learn spear skills from Viscount Baker. Only then will you become the spear genius from my memories.’

He looked at Pierce’s face fixedly.

He was still dodging his sight with a stiffened expression.

“Pierce. Do you remember what I told you last time?”

A sudden story.

Pierce, who was resolved to not converse at all, slightly turned away.

An expression implying what he meant.

Roan smiled faintly and said.

“The day when the two of us remained when of all the others went on vacation.”

“Ah……..”

Pierce let out a low exclamation.

Roan continued saying.

“That time you told me. That I will become a great general that makes the continent tremble.”

“Yes. I certainly did so.”

Pierce unconsciously nodded and replied back.

Roan brightly smiled and asked in return.

“So what did I tell you then?”

At that instant, Pierce flinched.

It was a memory that he couldn’t forget.

As he hesitated, Roan continued saying.

“That if I become a great commander, you will become the best spearman in the continent. I certainly said so.”

Roan took in a deep breath.

“I still haven’t changed my mind about that. Pierce, if it’s your talent you will certainly be able to become the best spearman in the continent.”

He had eyes that don’t even have the slightest movement.

Pierce’s heart began to beat faster.

Roan started to put in more and more strength in his voice.

“Pierce. I will work hard to become a great general that makes the continent tremble.”

It was a declaration.

It was a really bold one.

It wasn’t something a mere class 5 adjutant should be saying.

But even so, Roan’s eyes and expression was still serious.

‘Actually, i’m planning to become a monarch……….’

He wasn’t in a situation to be able to say that yet. Roan continued saying.

“If I become a great commander, i’m planning to use you as a general as promised. And because of that……….”

His eyes became hot.

And that was also the same for Pierce.

“You also need to become the strongest spearman in the continent as promised.”

Boom.

A big rock fell down in Pierce’s heart.

“Strongest spearman in the continent………”

He bit his lower lip.

‘To become a spearman stronger than anyone………’

Becoming Reil’s disciple was the most certain method.

Pierce raised his head and looked at Roan.

And Roan slowly nodded.

“The opportunity to become the best spearman in the continent is right in front of your eyes.”

Pierce’s face heated up.

Roan grabbed Pierce’s shoulders with both of his hands.

“Pierce. Grab this opportunity.”

A voice with strength followed.

“For me.”

Chapter 61




Edits: updated “commander of eastern region” to “Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander”.

Dudududu.

Tens of cavalrymen rode down the plain escorting a big carriage.

“It’s a really secluded place.”

The carriage shook about.

A middle aged man that had a big build looked at the scenery outside the carriage and frowned.

‘Should I have rested instead?’

His regret came late.

But in the end the man shook his head.

‘No. I can’t just leave that Reil guy alone.’

If he slipped up, a force from the eastern region that followed him could appear.

“I can’t let him be like that. The eastern territory is my territory.’

The face of the man stiffened.

He was a middle aged man with a large build.

He was the supreme commander of the Eastern Regional Corps, Viscount Benjamin Doyle.

Then from the other side, a cunning voice could be heard.

“There’s no need for supreme commander to step out for things like this……”

The owner of the voice was Baron Ive Lever, who was a staff officer that had the rank of a corps commander and was close to Benjamin.

He was putting on a smile as cunning as his voice.

“No. I have to certainly press him down at this opportunity.”

“Viscount Baker is only a skilled spearman. He doesn’t even have a force at his side, so why are you this worried?”

He made a stupid sound.

Benjamin’s eyes became fierce.

“Don’t say such comfortable things. There are countless people that would gather below him if he just raises his flag.”

He clenched his fists.

“Now is the only opportunity to press him down.”

If he raised a disciple or obtained a territory, it was obvious that his forces would grow at an amazing speed.

‘If that happens, it would be dangerous for me.’

Benjamin took in a deep breath.

‘I have to make the legion commander stand by my side at this opportunity.’

He needed to have a starting point which Reil wouldn’t even be able to touch.

A dense desire appeared in Benjamin’s eyes.

******

“No. That’s not it. The position of your foot is wrong.”

Reil moved around busily and yelled.

He was checking on the training of the soldiers of rose troop while they were on the training field.

“You have to twist your wrist there.”

“Yes! Understood!”

The soldiers were putting in a lot of effort.

‘When will we be able to receive teachings from Viscount Baker!’

‘I have to learn all that I can!’

Their gazes were naturally directed to the front.

There was a youth with a childish face who trained just like them at the front.

‘This is all because of sir adjutant Roan.’

‘Sir adjutant begged Viscount Baker himself.’

The reason why the soldiers could receive Reil’s teachings.

That was because of Roan.

Actually, Reil already planned to teach Roan some important things before he returned to his territory.

Although he couldn’t take in him as a formal disciple because of the mana technique, he couldn’t just leave an outstanding talent alone.

In Roan’s case, if he fixed his many bad habits he had and altered some sloppy parts, he would be able to raise to a greater level than now.

Because of that, he followed Roan all day and taught him this and that.

And Roan realized that Reil’s teachings were quite an important thing.

At the same time, he thought that he didn’t want to receive the teachings alone. Instead he wanted to do it with the soldiers of rose troop.

Roan carefully revealed his thoughts and Reil accepted them with pleasure.

Because of that, the soldiers experienced an exciting situation that they normally wouldn’t be able to have even once in their lives.

“Now! Let’s do it from the start!”

Reil clapped and encouraged the soldiers.

“Good. You have to do it like that!”

Whether he complimented them.

“You have to step a bit more to the left when you do that.”

Or he gave them advice.

“Again! It’s all wrong!”

Or he became angry.

Reil passionately taught the soldiers.

“Mmm.”

His sight moved towards Roan.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation flowed out.

‘He certainly became better.’

Originally, Roan didn’t have many useless movements in his spear skills.

But even so, there were still some lacking points in Reil’s eyes.

He showed Roan some postures of himself, and Roan fixed them.

And the effects appeared on the spot.

‘Do I have to say that his eyes are good?’

Roan had an ability to not miss even the slightest movements.

Actually, Reil didn’t know it, but Roan’s ability was thanks to Kalian’s tear.

‘I get to see many more things in a short moment because of Kalian’s tear.’

Even if Reil made a small movement, he could grasp all of the information like: the position of the wrist, the foot, the twisting of the joints, etc.

‘Because of that, I get to know how to make a proper and precise stance.’

Roan ground his teeth.

Spat!

The spear cut through the air and moved.

‘It certainly became more comfortable.’

He had only changed some small movements, but swinging and stabbing the spear became much more comfortable.

‘I have to learn all that I can before Viscount Baker leaves.’

Roan was even more passionate than Reil.

Although he couldn’t become his formal disciple, he tried extremely hard to properly learn even a single stance.

Spat!

His spear cut through the air again.

*****

“Baron Tate, nowadays you would feel full even if you didn’t eat anything.”

“Hahaha. Honestly speaking, it is a bit assuring.”

Aaron faintly smiled and nodded.

He was facing Io and conversed with him.

‘To have the opportunity to talk with Count Lancephil for such a long while.’

He was noble that had only five such similar nobles in the kingdom.

For Aaron, who was only a baron, he was an existence that was really difficult to see.

On top of that, it was almost impossible to get closer to him with only conversing.

‘It’s already been four days since we were together.’

This was all for Roan.

‘It seems like he has fun when he talks about Roan.’

Io stayed in the headquarters of rose troop and talked about many things with Roan at his side.

Tactics and strategies were obvious, but they also talked about their own lives.

‘I have to get in his eyes in this opportunity.’

Aaron bit his lower lip.

If he could do so, he could gain a rock solid background into the kingdom.

“How long is Count Lancephil planning to stay in the kingdom?”

“Mmm. I wonder………”

Io’s last words dimmed.

Even if he didn’t do so, he was already worried about that part.

‘I was planning to return to Pavor castle after meeting with Viscount Baker……….’

His first objective was returning to the castle after taking Reil.

But now, he was pouring more interest in Roan rather than Reil.

But even so, he couldn’t leave his territory empty.

‘It would be good to move when Viscount Baker also leaves.’

He wanted to take Roan with him, but there was something called procedures in the army.

‘I could also invite Roan later.’

Before that, he was planning to raise their intimacy.

“Probably ten………”

When he talked up to then, a knock was heard.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

“It’s Mendel.”

The owner of the voice was the closest one to Aaron and the eldest among the staff officers.

“Come in.”

Aaron slightly smiled towards Io and then looked at the entrance.

Kiig.

The door carefully opened and Mendel showed up with a perplexed expression.

“What happened?”

At the question, Mendel bowed down.

“The gift you asked for has just arrived.”

“Ah……”

A low exclamation came out of Aaron’s mouth.

He brightly smiled and nodded.

“It came at a suitable time.”

His voice was a bit excited.

But Mendel still had a perplexed expression.

“But……”

He couldn’t finish his words and hesitated.

“But……….?”

As Aaron asked back, Mendel let out a short sigh.

“Whew. The Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander, Viscount Benjamin Doyle, has brought the gift himself.”

“Huh?”

Aaron frowned.

‘Viscount Doyle moved by himself?’

Something he had never thought about had just occurred.

Benjamin was originally someone with a heavy butt.

Aaron’s face stiffened.

‘It’s because of Viscount Baker.’

Benjamin not liking Reil was a fact that was well known.

‘If I make a mistake, a disorder may hap……’

When he thought up to this part.

Io’s voice was heard.

“Don’t worry too much.”

He also knew a lot about how Benjamin was thinking about Reil.

But there was no need to worry.

Io brightly smiled and continued saying.

“I’m here.”

Although Benjamin was the commander of the eastern region, he wouldn’t be able to act as he wished in front of a count.

The smile on his mouth became even more dense.

*****

Benjamin was really displeased.

‘I’m here but they don’t even come to greet me?’

This was the arrival of a commander.

They had just sent a staff officer that was called Mendel.

‘He wouldn’t already have connoted to that Reil, right?’

His face stiffened.

Ive, who was looking at the side, shook his head with a cunning expression.

“Baron Tate is really bad mannered.”

It was a sound that scratched your insides.

Benjamin tightly bit his lower lip.

‘I will have to properly scold him.’

He was planning to show his imposing self.

‘I will make him realize where the 7th corps is from.’

Benjamin and Reil.

He was planning to clearly show him who he had to serve between him and Reil.

Then, Mendel who was walking in front, stepped aside and bowed.

“It’s here.”

It was quite a shabby and small entrance.

This was Gale’s office.

“Whew.”

Benjamin spat a long breath and kicked the door.

Bang!

A sound that seemed the door may fly off rang out.

Benjamin moved inside through the open door and yelled with all his strength.

“Baron Tate! I came to visit myself but you dare……”

But his intent soon disappeared.

“Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?”

Benjamin stammered because he was seriously surprised.

He discovered Io too late.

Benjamin pointed at Io with a trembling finger.

“Why, why is sir, sir count here……”

Then, Io brightly smiled and shook his head.

“Viscount Doyle. Did you just point your finger at me?”

At those words, Benjamin was surprised and hid his finger behind his back.

And then, he deeply bowed.

“Greetings to Count Lancephil.”

Ive also hurriedly bowed down.

But Benjamin slightly turned his head and looked at Ive.

‘Why didn’t you tell me that sir count was here?’

Those eyes.

Ive shook his head with a perplexed expression.

‘I also didn’t know.’

Those eyes.

Then, Reil and Roan appeared from the open door.

Reil discovered Benjamin who was bowing deeply and burst out in laughter.

“Hahaha! Viscount Doyle, you have come!”

Then, he hit Benjamin’s back and sat next to Io.

For Benjamin, this was a really humiliating situation.

‘Reil, you bastard………’

Curses surged up to his throat.

‘Damn. Let’s calm down for now. Calm……..’

He forcefully smiled and stood still.

Only then did Aaron stand up.

“Come over here.”

“Thank you.”

Benjamin had a rotten smile and moved towards Aaron’s seat.

He bowed once more towards Io.

“I didn’t know that sir count Lancephil was here.”

“I hurriedly came here after hearing that Viscount Baker was here.”

“Ah…..You did.”

Benjamin was still putting on an awkward smile.

Then, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“Sir commander. Should we start?”

A carefully asking look was seen on his face.

However Benjamin saw him to be really detestable.

‘Damn. I can’t even say anything because of Count Lancephil.’

He couldn’t do anything and just awkwardly smiled and nodded.

Aaron smiled brightly and looked at Roan.

“Roan.”

“Yes. Corps commander.”

Roan replied in a low voice.

He was feeling stifled right now.

‘Benjamin Doyle. Why did this Viscount come over here?’

His eyes became fierce.

‘In my past life, because of this viscount……..’

One of the reasons he would stay as an ordinary spearman.

That was because of Benjamin.

Then, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“Do you remember what I told you before you left for the temporary retirement?”

Roan didn’t reply hurriedly and waited for the next words.

Aaron faintly smiled and continued saying.

“That I would give you a gift when you returned to the troop.”

“Ah……..”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

‘He did. He said that he had some gifts for me.’

As he couldn’t get a hold of himself, he had forgotten that truth.

Aaron slightly looked at Reil.

“One of those was an invitation for Viscount Reil Baker……..”

Now, he looked at Benjamin.

“The other one……..”

Benjamin stood up as if he was waiting for it and extended his hand towards Ive.

Ive hurriedly approached and gave him a wide wooden box.

Click.

The lid of the box opened along with a pleasing sound.

Benjamin carefully raised the object inside the box with his two hands.

A round object that was a bit larger than a coin and had a high class silk band hung from it.

Aaron brightly smiled and continued saying.

“It’s a commander class military achievement badge.”

At that instant, Roan’s eyes turned big.

‘Badge?!’

This was a really unexpected gift.

‘At most, I thought that it would be a good spear or an armor.’

Just thinking about it made him satisfied. But to suddenly receive a badge.

“It seems like you’re really surprised?”

Aaron faintly smiled and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“Although it’s a commander class, it’s a military service badge that received permission from the kingdom. Do you know what this means?”

Roan shook his head.

Aaron said as if he was whispering.

“That however much you accumulate merits, there’s a limit to the rank of a commoner. At most they can become staff officers in their respective troops. Beyond that, you need a title of nobility.”

Roan nodded.

It was something he knew very well.

“But for a commoner to obtain a title of nobility and become a noble is as difficult as getting a star from the sky. You can see it as being almost impossible.”

Aaron’s sight moved to the badge.

“But if you have a badge, the situation changes. A commoner that has a badge reaches the minimum condition for enabling you to receive a title of nobility.”

“Ah……..”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

His eyes moved towards the badge on its own.

Aaron’s voice was heard.

“Roan. Now, the path to become a noble has opened up.”

A new start (4) End

But of course, even if you received a badge, it didn’t mean that you could become a noble immediately.

You only had the requirements to be able to become one only when you had enough accomplishments.

‘For me to get a badge……’

Roan looked at Benjamin who was holding the badge.

‘And on top of that from Benjamin Doyle?’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

‘In my past life the relationship between us was one of the worst ones.’

It wasn’t enough that he ignored his merits but he even demoted him several times.

He was a bastard that he wanted to hit if only he could.

But he was able to receive a badge from him.

“I’m giving the commander class badge with the permission of Rinse kingdom to class 5 adjutant of the 7th corps..”

At Ive’s words, Roan approached Benjamin and bowed.

“So you are Roan.”

Benjamin looked at Roan with an interested expression.

‘Ale gorge battle, Pedian plain’s monster subjugation, Int forest battle, Prely river inundation tactic, Slen battle….. For a normal soldier to accumulate this many merits.’

This was such a surprising thing.

On top of that Roan was only 18.

‘It means that he has more chances to grow from now on……..’

For Benjamin who had big ambitions, he needed someone with skills.

‘I will have to make him mine in this opportunity.’

He was planning to persuade the 7th corps and Aaron to take Roan to his side.

He hung the badge on Roan’s chest and hit his shoulder.

“Your merits were outstanding. You have done well.”

“Thank you.”

These were words he forcefully brought out.

He didn’t want to say thanks to this bastard.

‘This situation is really weird.’

Although in his past life he certainly was in the worst relationship with him, in this life they didn’t have any problems.

But of course, even if that was the case, he wasn’t thinking of getting closer to him.

‘This bastard has many problems. Be it his temperament or abilities……..’

He was a guy that wouldn’t be of any use even if you left him at your side.

No, rather, there was a bigger chance that he would affect you.

But Roan erased his displeased feeling for now.

‘He’s my superior for now.’

He was still in the eastern army.

If he acted as he wished here, his life would get tangled up just like his past one.

Then, Benjamin’s voice was heard.

“I’m promoting Roan by one rank alongside the badge and naming him a class 4 adjutant.”

The badge and if it was a commander class badge, it was an obvious condition.

From here, a good spear and some money was given to him as a reward.

“Congratulations.”

Io, Reil, Aaron and Gale congratulated him.

Roan looked at his badge and the people and took in a deep breath.

This was the moment his emotions became immeasurable.

‘Count Lancephil, Viscount Baker, Baron Aaron and troop commander Gale……..’

They were all people he looked at from far away in his past life.

But now, they were all looking at him and applauding.

‘The path is certainly open.’

But he still didn’t know if the path was open for him to become a noble, a great general, or a monarch.

But at least, it wasn’t one where he would die without having done much.

Grit.

Roan ground his teeth.

‘I’m walking forward without getting arrogant.’

He held his resolution.

Then, Benjamin’s voice was heard again.

“Until now, it was only the normal reward of the badge. But……..”

A faint smile appeared.

‘I have to give him a good impression now.’

Benjamin wanted to take Roan’s interest.

“I will especially give you one more reward. If there’s something you wish, speak. If it’s something I can do, I will listen to it.”

It was an unexpected proposal.

And Ive also had a surprised expression.

Io, Reil and Aaron just looked at Aaron’s mouth.

Especially Aaron and Gale, who had already faced this once, had interested expressions.

And Roan also didn’t hesitate this time.

‘If it’s Benjamin Doyle’s character, the moment I decline it, it becomes as if nothing had happened in an instant.’

He knew about Benjamin’s character really well.

He was a greedy and selfish bastard.

It was more profitable to catch it when he was saying that he would give something.

If he declined or hesitated for a moment, it became as if it had never happened.

Roan slightly raised his head and looked at Benjamin’s face.

“There’s someone I want to bring to my troop.”

At those words, Benjamin faintly smiled and nodded.

‘That much is easy.’

If it was a soldier from the eastern army, he could move them from troops however much he desired.

“Who’s that?”

He asked confidently in return. .

Roan shortly replied back.

“It’s spearman Harrison from the 15th squad of thorn troop of 7th corps.”

Harrison.

The one that had a genius like talent in the bow.

It became time to bring him in.

*********

Sweeeee!

A sharp sound rang out.

Puk!

At the same time, one arrow pierced a small branch.

Pabat!

One youth ran through the forest quickly and knocked the bow.

Tung!

A heavy sound sounded out.

Sweeeeee!

One more arrow pierced the wind along a sharp sound.

The arrow that flew while it had evaded the many trees.

Puk!

The arrow pierced a small branch.

The sharp sounds were heard continuously like that.

******

“Where did this bastard go to!”

Vice squad commander of the 15th squad of thorn troop, Hass, was annoyed.

He had already taken a blow from the squad commander since early in the morning.

When he was looking where to vent his anger, he couldn’t see a guy.

“He, it seems like he went to Polt forest.”

One squad member replied.

Hass kicked the ground and yelled.

“Again?! So he’s firing arrows again inside the forest!”

It was an expression that implied that he was caught.

“Even so, I was planning to teach him, it turned out well though. For a spearman to always train in the bow while leaving behind the spear.”

Hass clenched his teeth and ground his teeth.

Then, one youth appeared from the entrance of the camp.

He was holding a large bow and quiver on his back.

Hass hurriedly ran over and swung his fist.

As it was a sudden attack, he should have been hit in his face.

But the fist cut the air.

“Why are you like this?”

Because the youth with the bow quickly dodged.

“This bastard dares to dodge my fist?”

Hass opened his eyes abruptly and clenched his fists one more time.

Then, the sound of the door opening was heard.

“What is it? What are you doing!”

The owner of the voice was one of the adjutants of thorn troop, Pad.

He glared at Hass while he held a piece of paper in his hand.

“Are you bullying the kids?”

“Ahem. No, no.”

And then he loosened his fist stealthily and shook his head.

An awkward expression appeared on his face.

Pad glared at that Hass for a moment and then turned to look to the youth with the bow.

“Take this.”

“Yes? What’s this?”

The youth received the paper with a confused look.

Pad shrugged his shoulders and replied.

“It’s a transfer order. It seems like it was directly laid down by the commander.”

“Transfer order?”

The youth looked at the paper with a confused face.

However, he couldn’t read the contents of it.

“I’m sorry, but where are they taking me to?”

At those words, Pad shortly replied.

“12th squad, rose troop of the 7th corps.”

“Ah……..”

A low exclamation came out from the youth’s mouth.

“Rose troop……….”

It was a sound that rolled from his mouth.

How long had he waited for this moment?

A deep gratitude was seen in the youth’s face.

Then, Pad hit his shoulder.

“Pack your things immediately and depart now.”

“Yes. I understand.”

The youth bowed deeply.

Pad left after saying that.

Hass approached as if he was waiting for it and growled.

“Look at this bastard. He’s dying of happiness. You really didn’t like being he……”

“Shut up for a moment.”

It was a cold voice.

The youth faintly smiled and looked at Hass.

It was a completely different attitude and eyes from earlier.

“Hass, i’m not your underling anymore. Don’t act as you wish.”

At those words, Hass’s face brightened up.

“Thi, this bastard! Are you crazy you bastard? Do you want to die?!”

He yelled with all his strength.

But the expression of the youth was still composed.

He looked at Hass fixedly.

“Hass. I’m not this bastard. My name is……”

The youth continued saying with clear words.

“Harrison.”

******

“Excellent. You certainly became better.”

Reil brightly smiled and clapped.

“It’s all because of Viscount Baker’s teachings.”

Roan bowed with an embarrassed expression.

“I have only fixed some stances.”

“Even so, i’m really thankful for checking up on me this carefully until the day before you leave.”

Reil who was being modest and Roan who was was truly thankful.

The two people looked at each other and smiled brightly.

Then, the accompanying knight Liam of Reil appeared from far away.

“Viscount Baker! It’s time to leave!”

“I know! I know!”

Reil yelled with all his strength.

It certainly wasn’t an action that a noble would be do.

He was that free and didn’t have a limit.

“I wanted to stay for a couple more days but…..”

Reil had a bitter smile while he was looking at Roan.

“I can’t leave my territory for long. A noble has a lot of paperwork and things to do.”

He smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

Even after Roan received his badge, Reil stayed for 10 more days.

Because of that, Io and Benjamin were also there because of him.

While they were like this, a letter arrived from Kevin two days ago.

Although the detailed contents weren’t revealed, Reil’s face stiffened, so it probably meant that Reil should leave immediately.

‘As Viscount Baker is leaving, all the others would leave too.’

It had also been long since Io left his territory, and in the case of Benjamin, he wouldn’t want to stay in a secluded place for long.

‘Troop commander Gale would like it the most.’

When Io, Reil, and Benjamin left today, Aaron would also return to the corps headquarters.

‘He had suffered for taking care of the upper ranked people until now.’

Roan felt a bit sorry towards Gale.

Because it was because of him that Io, Reil, Benjamin and Aaron ended up staying in the headquarters of rose troop.

Then Reil’s voice was heard.

“Then, before I leave…..”

He took out a book from his chest.

“Take it.”

“What’s this?”

Roan received the book with his two hands.

Reil brightly smiled and replied.

“I wrote down the bad habits, movements, problems, and etc.. As you aren’t a member of my family and can’t be my formal disciple, I can’t teach you spearmanship. But even so I don’t want to leave everything as if I don’t know about it.”

“Ah…”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

His heart choked because of Reil’s consideration.

“What’s the reason you are taking care of me this much……..?”

Roan’s voice and attitude were very careful.

On the other side, Reil was still bright.

“I’m planning to teach Pierce everything I have. If it’s his talent, he would probably even surpass me. In the position of the master, it’s a really proud and happy thing, but looking at it from his point of view……..”

It was an empty kind of smile.

“It is a really sad and lonely thing. Not having anyone to spar with…….”

“Ah……..”

Roan bit his lower lip.

He understood the reason for the empty smile.

‘He was lonely until now.’

He didn’t have any opponents to face.

There wouldn’t be something more lonely and sad than that for a warrior.

Reil continued saying.

“Roan. I want you to become much stronger than now. For you, and for Pierce. And perhaps for me. I made this book with that kind of feeling. I would like it if it helped you in becoming strong.”

It wasn’t only Pierce but he was saying to become an opponent also worthy of him.

Roan slowly nodded.

“I understand what you are saying.”

At those words Reil smirked and hit Roan’s chest.

“Take it into account. If you don’t want to be put to shame the day Pierce finds you again, you will have to train and keep training.”

“I understand. At least in effort, i’m confident.”

A strong will was felt from the shut mouth.

Reil proudly smiled and nodded.

“Right. There’s nothing more important than effort.”

He grabbed Roan’s hands.

“You will be able to do well.”

“Thank you.”

Roan bowed.

Reil smirked and looked towards the south.

“Should I go now?”

Everyone should have finished preparations and was waiting for him.

“I will take the lead.”

Roan faintly smiled and started to walk one step ahead of him.

But Reil started to walk next to him.

“No, not that……”

He put his arm around his shoulder and brightly smiled.

“Let’s walk like this.”

Roan and Reil.

The two people relied on each other and moved.

The relationship had become thicker like that.

******

“Come to Pavor castle to visit once.”

“Remember the words I told you.”

“If you wish, I can transfer you to the headquarters in the east.”

Io, Reil and Benjamin all said their farewells and stepped back.

Now, the remaining one was only Pierce.

“Sir adjutant Roan.”

Pierce bowed in front of Roan.

“If I were to say honestly, I have greater feelings of wanting to stay here.”

“Pierce……..”

Roan said as if trying to ease him up.

Then, Pierce raised his head and looked at Roan’s eyes.

“But just like what you have said back then, I will leave for you sir adjutant.”

Strength was put into his voice.

“I will work hard and return in the fastest time possible.”

At those words Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

“Right. I will be waiting for you.”

Roan and Pierce.

The two people just looked at each other’s faces for a while.

After a while, Roan looked at Reil who was waiting at the back and grabbed Pierce’s shoulders.

“Viscount Baker is waiting. Go, now.”

“Yes. Then, I will be going.”

Pierce bowed deeply.

His heart was still immature and soft.

His shoulders trembled.

Roan pretended not to notice it and patted Pierce’s back.

“Go quickly.”

Pierce couldn’t raise his head and started to walk towards Reil.

Reil consoled Pierce and got on the horse.

Roan just stood still and watched that.

‘Pierce. Have a safe trip. When you return back……’

Fire appeared in his eyes.

‘Many things will have changed.’

Only if it went according to his plans though.

‘By then, you will have many things to do.’

Pierce was more important than anyone else for Roan.

Meanwhile Io, Benjamin, Reil, and Pierce departed and went towards their objectives.

Aaron and Gale looked at them for a moment and then returned to their own headquarters.

The only one that remained until the end was Roan.

It was even after the members of the 12th squad guessed Roan’s feelings.

‘Now, I can’t even see them with Kalian’s tear.’

He couldn’t see Pierce’s back anymore.

“Whew.”

A long sigh came out.

When he was about to look away because of his hurting eyes.

He could see one man that was approaching him from the end of the plains.

He had quite the nimble steps.

“Ah……..”

A low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

He had confirmed the face of the man through Kalian’s tear.

He stopped his feet and just stood at the gates of the castle for a while.

After a while, the man that was like a grain soon arrived in front of the gate.

He discovered Roan late and came in a hurried manner.

Clack. Clack.

The tools in his big bag clashed and made query sounds.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

The man stood in front of Roan and panted.

His heaving chest was calmed a bit.

Only then did he smile brightly and saluted Roan.

“Sir! I, spearman Harrison of thorn troop of the 7th corps received a transferral order.”

That man, he was none other than Harrison.

‘For Harrison to come when Pierce leaves.’

This was a strange fate.

This was a strange relation.

Roan faintly smiled and hit Harrison’s shoulder.

His eyes were really gentle.

He had a feeling of meeting his longing friend again.

“You came well. Harrison.”

He spoke in a soft voice.

Roan grabbed Harrison’s two hands.

“I was waiting for you.”

Chapter 63




“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh.

He sat down in front of a small stove.

Tadak. Tadak.

Although summer hadn’t ended yet, a strong heat was emanating continuously from the stove.

“Certainly, the accumulation of the mana is much faster than when I was at miss Biate’s place.”

Roan was now practicing Reid’s Flamdor mana technique.

He had turned on the stove to absorb a little bit more of fire essence.

He slowly stood up and loosened his wrists and ankles.

‘I wanted to live together with my squad members but…….’

He had a place to be alone to practice the Flamdor mana technique.

And just in time, Aaron and Gale obtained a small and clean house near the headquarters because of the reward.

Roan excused himself from the squad members and moved to another house.

And after that, he even shortened the time to eat or sleep and concentrated in training in the mana technique.

And on top of that, he lit the stove everyday. .

‘It’s already been three months since Pierce left.’

There were many things that happened in that while, but there were two especially important things.

One was that Roan started to train in the mana technique and Reid’s battle techniques earnestly.

The remaining one was that he had risen to the rank of vice troop commander of rose troop along with Keniss.

Roan, who had already reached 1 class adjutant tried to decline, but Gale was adamant.

It meant that he couldn’t leave him as a normal adjutant when he had received a badge.

At this point Roan convinced him to also add Keniss, and then he ended up agreeing.

‘Because of that I get to lead the spearmen squad, swordsmen, and archers.’

Roan tried to mix these squads and make a new structure but he gave up in the end.

‘The cavalrymen, defenders, and the strong ones are commanded by vice squad commander Keniss. If I make a mistake, I will only cause a commotion.’

In the end he decided to put the squad and formation revisions for another time.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a short sigh and grabbed Travias spear that was in his waist.

Cheng!

As he put in mana, the blade appeared along with tbe pleasing sound of metal.

‘Hm.’

One thread of mana surged from his mana hole and went towards his right hand.

The mana road was quite hard and smoothly cleared because of the long training.

Swush.

He felt his palm tickle and then mana was put in the spear.

Roan just condensed mana into the blade instead of increasing the length or thickness.

Oooong.

A white light appeared slightly on the blade with a short vibration.

Roan concentrated a bit more and poured more mana into it but there were no more changes.

“Whew.”

In the end, he let out a long sigh and retracted his mana.

Cheng!

The Travias spear turned to become a steel stick again accompanied by the sound of metal.

‘For now, am I able to cover the blade with mana?’

Even so, it still wasn’t comparable to things such as normal blades.

‘Should I say that I just opened my eyes in the operation of mana?’

But even so, the encouraging thing was that Reid’s Flamdor mana technique was amazing.

Being able to cover the blade with mana with only three months of training was solely because of the mana technique.

‘This was one of the reasons I didn’t become Viscount Baker’s disciple.’

No, the biggest reason Roan didn’t become his disciple.

It was that he believed in the strength the mana technique had.

Although Reil’s mana technique and spear skills were strong, it wasn’t comparable to the mana technique of the strongest man in history, who was called the fire monarch.

‘Although it’s regrettable that I can’t learn the spear with Viscount Baker, the mana technique fills in the lacking points and is more than enough.’

On top of that, although they weren’t spear skills that utilized mana, Roan had tens and hundreds of real battle spear skills in his head.

‘Although I can’t make an amazing spearmanship like Pierce in an instant……….’

If he gathered the good points of many spear skills and took out the bad ones he was confident in being able to make a powerfully strong spearmanship.

Most of all.

‘I have Reid’s battle technique with me.’

Roan was planning to mix up the battle techniques with the real battle spear skills.

If it was Reil’s battle techniques that shook the continent, it would be able to seriously complement the weak and strong points that his spearmanship had itself. .

‘A combination of the spear and the battle technique.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘I will show you a completely new spearmanship.’

He took in a deep breath.

If it just became like that, he was planning on being able to beat Pierce even after he learned Reil’s spear skills.

‘First, the level of the mana technique itself is different.’

His heart beated loudly.

Now, he could really see a different future to his past.

‘Anyways……’

Roan bit his lower lip and opened his hand.

Although everything was going according to his plans, there was still one thing that worried him.

‘Why is the mana shining in white light?’

When he looked at the rumours, various documents, and the contents written in the mana technique book, the light of the flame monarch’s mana should have been red.

But Roan’s mana was rather transparent.

‘The element the mana has is certainly fire. Only that the colour is different…….’

He still couldn’t discover any more problems aside from the color.

Although he felt that the accumulation of the mana was a bit slow, he couldn’t confirm it as he hadn’t compared it with other mana techniques.

‘Is it because of that silver waterdrop?’

If that was the essence of water, wouldn’t it be having some influence on the mana technique?

He couldn’t be certain of anything.

‘I’m not even certain if that was the essence of water in the first place.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

It was a problem that didn’t have answers even if he pondered about it.

‘If I get to find the pieces miss Biate left, wouldn’t this problem be solved?’

He bit his lower lip.

He couldn’t run to Poskein lake right now and retrieve Biate’s piece.

He decided to leave it for later.

‘There are no problems right now…….’

No, rather because the color of the mana changed, there was also a good point in it.

‘Because it’s not of a red light, other people would also never think that this is sir Reid’s mana technique.’

In his past life, a war between Rinse kingdom and Estia kingdom happened because of this mana technique.

‘Because the color of the mana changed, I wouldn’t have to worry about that war happening.’

People wouldn’t be able to know that Roan was learning mana if he didn’t reveal it himself.

Ududuk. Duduk.

Roan softly loosened the joints in all his body and opened the door.

There wasn’t anything better than to train your body when your head got complicated.

He took in a breath of the dawn air and ran towards the east gate.

The world was still dark.

It was still really early before dawn.

There was still a lot things to do before the sun rose.

Even so, Roan’s steps didn’t hesitant.

The darkness wasn’t any problem to him because of Kalian’s tear.

He went towards a secluded place near the east gate.

The castle gates were still closed because it was still before the sun peeked the horizon.

But even so, he couldn’t train in Reid’s battle techniques in the headquarters training grounds.

‘There’s nowhere as suitable as this.’

Roan looked at the place that was covered with dense trees and smiled.

He stood off at one side of the secluded place and slightly bent his knees.

He clenched his two fists and slightly bent his body towards the side.

It was an action that seemed that he would swing his fist at any moment

“Whew.”

Roan breathed out and kicked the ground.

Pabat! Pat!

At the same time, the two fists split through the air without stopping.

Spat!

The two legs moved strangely and quickly.

After that, kicks followed up.

Reid’s battle techniques was closer to mixed martial arts.

There were various techniques such as kicking, throwing, choking, and smashing included into it.

And those various strong techniques connected with each other and composed one big technique.

‘I’m still training in the basic techniques. I have to put in even more effort to master the intermediate and expert techniques.’

But of course, he also had to pour time and effort in training his mana technique.

‘I’m lacking time.’

It was Roan that nowadays thought that he would like it if a day was ten times longer.

Pabat!

It was a dark dawn.

Roan moved relentlessly inside that darkness.

*****

It wasn’t that Roan just focused on individual training.

He also poured much time in training the spearmen, swordsmen, and archers as the vice troop commander of rose troop.

He taught the 12th squad the newest training methods he knew and several signals, etc. Especially the first.

Although he couldn’t touch the formation of the troop, instead, he made it so spearmen could help each other, swordsmen between them, and archers between archers.

He had half imitated the formation.

Flock!

The flagman was shaking two different flag sideways.

At that instant, the squad members who were in their formations scattered to the sides and moved with purpose.

Flock! Flock!

This time, the two flags moved at the same time.

The squad members started to return to their original formation as if they were waiting for it.

Roan, who was checking the movements of the soldiers while he was standing at the top of the training grounds, nodded with a smile.

‘They are still at a basic level but they are all adapting at the signs.’

Because of that, he would be able to send simple but important orders faster than before.

“Retreat.”

As Roan let down the order, the flagman shook the flag widely.

In that instant, the soldiers that were running in the training grounds retreated like water.

‘Good.’

While he was being proud.

“Vice troop commander.”

One soldier hurriedly approached.

“What happened?”

At the question, the soldier pointed towards the entrance.

“Someone visited.”

Roan just waited for the next words.

“He says that he’s called Chris.”

At the following words, Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

‘He finally came.’

It had been a month since he sent the visit request to Chris.

He had finally arrived at Beno castle.

Roan ordered the soldiers to rest and then started to move.

As he approached the entrance, he saw Chris around it.

“Mister Chris.”

“Ah! Sir adjutant Roan. Ah, no. You became the vice troop commander.”

Chris faintly smiled and bowed.

“Thank you for coming such a long way.”

“No. Even so, I wanted to visit you once.”

At Roan’s words, Chris shook his hands.

“Let’s go to my place for now.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan and Chris walked side by side and asked each other about their well being. When they were talking about how they were, Roan’s promotion, the badge, and other things, they arrived at quite the fine house.

“Let’s go in.”

Roan opened the door first and moved inside.

Chris looked at his back and hurriedly scanned his surroundings.

It was the habit and mannerisms especially from an information agent.

‘There’s a great amount of books.’

The house was quite unshapely.

The proper furniture consisted of a table, some chairs, and a bed at most. In the remaining places, there were incredible amount of books everywhere.

“Did you read this all?”

Chris grabbed a book and asked.

Roan shook his head with a really composed attitude and expression.

“No. I couldn’t even read half of them.”

He had an awkward smile.

Those words were true.

Even so, it was a possible amount because he had also read in his past life.

He gathered books from everywhere because of his greed but he didn’t have much time to read books because of the training.

But the reason he didn’t stop buying books.

‘If it gets a bit more systematized, I will have to teach the soldiers to read.’

Roan knew that that was one of the conditions for a strong army.

“You were really surprised after reading my letter, right?”

At those words Chris shook his head.

“No. I was also planning to visit you, vice troop commander.”

“Really?”

“Yes.”

Chris took out a pile of paper while answering.

“Do you remember the five merchants I told you last time, in Miller?”

“Yes. Of course I do.”

Roan received the papers and nodded.

Chris continued saying.

“For the past few months I have continuously invested in the five young merchants: Tio, Lidia, Eska, Nego, and Ford.”

Roan attentively listened.

“Amongst them, Lidia, who’s a timber, and Eska who’s a chef, are bringing quite an amazing profit. On the other side Tio, who’s of the transportation industry and Nego, who’s of the loaning industry, don’t have many accomplishments to talk about. Lastly, mister Ford who’s of the mining industry…….”

Chris awkwardly smiled and shook his head.

“It seems like we wasted the investment. Precisely speaking, it seems like he even has debt.”

Roan just nodded.

In the first place, he didn’t think that all of them would succeed.

But that wasn’t the important thing.

“In your opinion, what do you think their futures would be?”

At those words Chris hesitated for a moment and then replied.

“Honestly speaking, the accomplishments of Tio, Nego, and Ford aren’t that good but……”

He put in more strength in his voice.

“I think that there’s worth in still checking on them.”

His eyes were filled with certainty.

Roan nodded.

He stood up and after he searched in the wardrobe next to the stove, he took out a big bag.

“I believe in your eyes in sizing up people.”

Roan took out three jewel bags that were quite heavy.

“Keep investing in them.”

Chris shook his hands with a bit of a surprised face.

“There’s no need to do this. As I have the profits from Lidia and Eska, it’s plenty with just one bag.”

He looked at the big bag.

‘He also gave me a jewel bag back in Miller……..’

He thought that it could be possible when he first received the investment in Beno castle.

He thought that it was a reward he received with the wanted reward.

But the jewel bag he showed back then and the one right now.

‘It’s not something that a normal soldier could accumulate.’

It was at a level where it could be accumulated in a few years if it was short, or some tens of years it it was long.

‘Now that I see it, there’s not much I know about vice troop commander Roan.’

It was quite an embarrassing situation to boast that he was an information agency.

‘Even so, I don’t want to forcefully check his background.’

At least, he wanted to give the information about Roan to him.

‘That’s the right thing.’

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“No. One bag won’t be enough.”

He shook his head and said as if whispering.

“You have new things to do.”

“Things…… to do?”

Chris asked back.

Roan nodded.

“The first thing………”

He brightly smiled and looked at Chris’s eyes fixedly.

“You will have to move your agency to Pavor castle.”

“To Pavor castle?”

Chris asked back with a surprised expression.

Roan slowly nodded.

‘It’s time to slowly move. No, he must move.’

The reason why he returned to Beno castle even after he acquired Reid’s mana technique and battle techniques.

That was because he remembered a lot of things that happened in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom, but there was the most important reason.

‘War will soon appear.’

It wasn’t a war between monsters.

It would be human vs human.

It would be kingdom vs kingdom.

It was almost time for the eastern region of Rinse kingdom to increase in heat.

Roan looked into Chris’s eyes.

“You will have to grasp all the information in the eastern region into your hands.”

That was the first thing he had to do.

His voice was filled with strength.

His two eyes fiercely shined.

Chapter 64




Sponsored Chapter

“Is there a reason I have to gather information centered in the capital of Miller? No, in the eastern region of the kingdom?”

He asked a sharp question.

Chris honestly revealed his doubts.

Roan slowly nodded and replied.

“The region is not normal.”

“Meaning that……..?”

Chris slowly frowned.

Roan continued saying with a composed expression.

“The movement of the monsters became worse than last year.”

But of course, that was a lie.

‘That time came.’

If the same future happened as his past life, soon, many monsters would appear in the eastern region.

“Mmm.”

Chris nodded.

“They were always noisy. To gather information at Miller’s side just to grasp the movement of the monsters is a bit……..”

Monsters were always a problem.

It meant that the problem was that frequent.

Because of that, he felt that Roan’s countermeasures were a bit excessive.

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“What I’m worried about………”

His expression and eyes were still composed.

“Is that there may be some stir because of the monsters.”

“Stir?”

Chris frowned.

Roan nodded.

“The stir of the monsters is starting with the eastern region as the center. When I analyzed their moving pattern and the regions they appeared in…….”

Gulp.

Chris unconsciously gulped.

Roan continued saying.

“It seems like they are crossing over from Istel kingdom. And as if they were being chased away on top of that.”

“Ah…….”

Chris let out a low exclamation.

He realized what Roan was thinking in an instant.

‘The monsters are crossing the boundaries as if they are being chased away………If then.’

His head spun.

Several and various kind of guesses were built and crumbled.

And then, he placed down the most possible guess.

“Isn’t Istel kingdom doing a massive monster subjugation?”

It was the most standard of guesses.

This year, a similar thing happened at the Pedian’s plain monster subjugation.

‘Because the Byron kingdom did a massive monster subjugation one step ahead, the number of monster at the Pedian’s plain increased explosively.’

The stir of the monsters in the eastern region could be seen in the same context.

Roan nodded.

“That’s the biggest possibility.”

He lightly sighed.

‘Although precisely speaking, they are preparing for war.’

In his past life, it was a war he had never expected.

Because of that, the eastern region became a wasteland.

‘The monsters of Istel kingdom fled to our side because they were frightened by the many soldiers.’

But in his past life, he didn’t think about the stir of the monsters too highly.

Then, Chris shook his head and said.

“But it’s a bit weird. At this time, Istel kingdom……..”

The last words dimmed.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“That’s right. Originally, they shouldn’t have power to spare to do a massive monster subjugation.”

“Yes. Because they should be focused on harvesting at this time.”

Chris said.

It was a time that the army and obviously the citizen should be focused on harvesting.

Because of that, nobody in Rinse kingdom could realize that Istel kingdom were preparing for war.

“But even so, they went out for a subjugation? Isn’t it a bit suspicious?”

Roan faintly smiled and asked.

Chris just nodded with a serious face.

“That’s why I want to know a bit more about it in detail. You will have to gather and analyze all the information in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom and of course the western region of Istel kingdom. And I would like it if you did that.”

Roan finished speaking and looked at Chris’s eyes fixedly.

It wasn’t a meaningless formal act.

‘A different future than what I know may happen.’

Because of that he had a need to gather and analyze information.

“Mmm.”

Chris nodded along a low exclamation.

“To do that, Pavor castle would certainly be better than the capital of Miller.”

He pondered for a moment and then looked at Roan while faintly smiling.

“I understand. As the situation is like this, I will immediately organize my agency and move to Pavor castle.”

“Thank you.”

A smile appeared on Roan’s face.

But he still had more things to do.

“And you will have to do one more thing.”

“Yes. Tell me.”

Chris opened up his ears while he was fixing his posture.

Roan slowly gathered the plans he had in his head.

“There’s a small fishing village called Perr in Poskein lake. There’s a sailor called Daiv in there.”

“Village of Perr, Daiv.”

Chris took note while mumbling.

Roan continued saying.

“You will have to make an organization of sailors with him as the center.”

“An organization?”

Chris asked back with a bit of a surprised face.

Roan slowly nodded.

His expression seemed to be having fun.

“Yes. We can’t just leave that wide lake like that.”

*****

Hoo. Hoo. Hoo.

The breath was rough.

But it wasn’t someone breathing.

Swush.

The warm wind shook the long grass.

Roan glared beyond the grass and made a sign.

The spearmen, swordsmen, and archers all lowered their bodies.

‘They came.’

A fierce light shined in his eyes.

Roan lowered his body and went towards the archer squad.

“Harrison.”

“Yes.”

At Roan’s call, Harrison replied in a low voice and approached.

Adjutant Jones, who was leading the archer squad, raised his ear because he was curious to see what happened.

Roan pointed beyond the grass with his finger.

“Do you see that goblin leader?”

“Yes, I do.”

Harrison nodded while gulping down dry saliva.

What Roan and Harrison, no, the spearmen and swordsmen squad of rose troop, and the archer troop were looking at beyond the grass while hiding, was a troop of goblins and kobolds that amounted to more than a thousand.

And among them, the biggest and strongest goblin was present.

He was the leader leading the troop.

Roan pointed at the goblin leader and asked in a low voice.

“Can you hit him?”

“Yes?! That’s impossible.”

The answer came from a weird place.

The owner of the voice was Jones, who was listening to them.

The experienced archer frowned and shook his hands.

“The distance between us is far and there are also a lot of obstacles in between. On top of that, he’s continuously moving.”

Those were the right words.

Currently, the goblin and kobold troops were moving inside Oat forest.

Roan and the soldiers were hiding in ambush at a place with high grass and trees.

Because of that, between them and the goblin leader, there were a lot of trees.

If only there weren’t any trees, the archer troop would already have poured a rain of arrows down on them

But even so Roan, had a really confident expression.

He looked at Harrison and waited for his answer.

“Whew.”

Harrison, who was glaring at the goblin leader and the obstacles, and judging the direction of the wind, put on a faint smile.

“I think I can.”

“Impossible.”

This time also, Jones’ reaction was a step faster.

He shook his head with an expression full of disbelief.

‘He took someone I hadn’t even heard of……’

Jones didn’t like Harrison in the first place, who got transferred from nowhere.

And he especially disliked that he received a bit interest from Roan.

‘He can hit the goblin leader from over here? Impossible.’

It was a situation where he had to persuade him from not doing it.

The moment he fired the arrow, their location would be discovered.

As rose troop was at a disadvantage in numbers, if a battle occurred, their lives would be in danger.

“Hitting the leader from here is im……..”

When Jones was about to step up.

Roan patted Harrison’s shoulders and nodded.

“I believe in you.”

“Thank you.”

Harrison bowed and then prepared an arrow.

“Huh?!”

Jones was stunned with a surprised expression.

Meanwhile, Harrison knocked the arrow and got up.

“Whew.”

He closed his eyes and felt the wind.

Roan looked at him and killed his breath.

‘If the leader dies, they will fall in confusion.’

If they could only take care of the goblin leader, they would be able to easily win.

Swish.

The hot wind blew once again.

‘The wind is a bit strong.’

Harrison slowly opened his eyes and pointed his bow towards the goblin leader.

The trees filled his sight.

They ran against each other and were lined up continuously.

‘I can see a path.’

Harrison held his breath.

The goblin leader, who didn’t know of this, was just moving around leisurely.

When he made two more steps.

Tung.

Harrison let go of the arrow.

Sweeeeeeee!

A sharp sound.

One arrow flew between the many trees.

Roan and Jones, and of course all the soldiers followed the arrow.

Sweee!

The arrow couldn’t completely dodge the last tree.

Spat!

It slightly scratched it and the direction changed.

Jones growled in a low voice as if he was waiting for it.

“See? I certainly said that you……”

But he couldn’t finish his words.

“Im, impossible!”

The words were the same but the feelings they gave off were completely different.

Because the arrow that had its direction slightly changed flew towards the head of the goblin leader like a lie.

“Chwee?”

The goblin leader turned his head along the sound that hit his ear and froze like that.

The head of the arrow was as big as a rock.

The moment he thought he had to dodge it.

Puuk!

The arrow pierced his forehead and was stuck in his head.

Boom!

The goblin leader fell down like that and couldn’t move anymore.

“Chwee?”

“Kak?”

The goblins and kobolds gathered near the goblin leader at the sudden change in situation.

At that sight Roan hit Harrison’s back with some gusto.

“You did well!”

“Thank you.”

Harrison faintly smiled and bowed.

Roan nodded and raised his spear highly.

“Attack!”

In a loud voice.

The order to attack was sent out.

“Waaaaaa!”

“Kill! Kill them!”

The soldiers of the troop charged the ground as if they were waiting for it and ran towards the goblins and kobolds.

And Roan also did the same.

He was the one who was running in front of all of them.

He was holding his spear in his armpit and running.

A fierce intent flowed.

‘Left, right, right again.’

Roan could charge through the trees with the shortest distance because of Kalian’s tear.

“He, he’s really fast!”

“Don’t fall back!”

“Stick to him!”

The soldiers followed his back with a surprised expression.

“Chwee?”

“Kak?”

Only then did the kobolds and goblins get a hold of themselves.

They looked at Roan who was already in front of them and raised their rough weapons.

“Hmph.”

Roan snorted and pulled up some mana.

But he was in a situation where he still had to hide the fact that he was learning mana.

He operated his mana road quickly without being able to bring it up to the blade of the spear.

But even with just that, it was amazing.

“Chwee!”

“Kak!”

Their cries hit his ear.

“Die!”

Roan let out a shout and then lowered his body and twisted his wrist.

Pat!

The spear split the air.

A sharp and smooth line of light was drawn over the heads of the goblins and kobolds.

Sugk.

A horrible sound rang out.

“Chwee?”

“Kak?”

The goblins and kobolds who were facing him stood stupidly and rolled their big eyes to the sides.

At that moment.

Sssss.

A fine crack appeared in their heads and then blood started to flow.

Boom!

The bastards fell accompanied by a heavy sound.

It showed just how powerful and quick that attack was. .

Sugk! Spat! Slash!

Roan swept up the front of the battlefield and swung his spear.

In the first place, the goblins and kobolds weren’t Roan’s opponents.

“Grr.”

“Keek.”

Every time the spear cut the air, their heads fell to the ground.

Continued by him, the spearmen, archers, and swordsmen attacked.

They were in a formation that seemed sloppy but was solid at the same time.

They moved just like one unit and massacred the goblins and kobolds.

The important thing was that compared to before, the three squads moved according to the situation of each other and helped themselves at the same time.

The goblins and kobolds fell down helplessly.

Between them, Roan was sweeping up the battlefield and showed an outstanding might.

Slash!

The spear passed through the neck of a goblin.

As the battle happened in a forest and they were confused, the battlefield was limited.

The spear, which was a long weapon, was at a disadvantage the more the space became limited.

But Roan still acted leisurely.

‘The combination of spearmanship and battling techniques.’

He utilized Reid’s battle techniques at situations where it was difficult to use the spear.

No, precisely speaking,they were movements imitating Reid’s battling techniques.

Although it wasn’t that he had created a new art by combining the two, but it was still powerful enough.

‘I fill up the weak points the spear has with the battling techniques.’

This was the best he could do with Roan’s ability.

‘If my understanding of each art increases, I will be able to create a real spearmanship.’

As he knew his current abilities and the level he was at, he didn’t think about doing that which was impossible right now.

He was planning to do what he could step by step.

Roan punched the goblin that got near him.

Puk! Pubuk!

It was a heavy sound.

“Krr!”

The goblins got their heads and ribs crushed to pieces and were flung to the side.

‘Strong.’

Certainly, the power of Reid’s battle techniques were amazing.

‘For movements that are only imitations to be this much……….’

He couldn’t even imagine how it would be when he properly executed it along with the Flamdor mana technique.

Puk! Pubuk! Puk!

The goblins became sludge at the consecutive punches.

“Chwee!”

“Chwee!”

In the end, the goblins that charged up to him became scared and fell back.

‘That’s just what I was waiting for!’

Roan swung his spear as if he was waiting for it.

Stab.

The spear stabbed the chests of the goblins.

If they got close, use Reid’s battle technique. If they were far, use spearmanship techniques.

Roan had two powerful weapons with him.

‘The combination of the spear and battle techniques is better than I thought.’

A smile appeared on his face.

He swung his spear without stop and punched out.

“Grr.”

The last words continued without stop.

There were countless corpses of goblins and kobolds near him.

The battle was now coming to an end.

“Whew.”

Roan looked at the battlefield and took in a breath.

The 12 and 13th squads were pushing back the ones that were fiercely fighting back.

‘The movements of the 12th squad is certainly the best.’

Anyways, you couldn’t do anything about it as they spent more time with Roan than the other squads.

Roan’s sight moved towards the archer squad.

Tung! Tung!

He saw a youth who was firing arrows without stopping.

Harrison.

Differently than the other archers, he ran across the forest and was sending precise arrows towards the goblins and kobolds.

Puk!

“Grr.”

One for one arrow.

On top of that, there were even times when an arrow killed two kobolds at the same time.

‘Certainly, Harrison’s talent with the bow is the best.’

Roan looked at Harrison’s face and smiled.

It was a happy smile.

‘He never put on that kind of expression in my previous life.’

Roan felt proud.

It was a feeling like he had made another person’s dream come true and not only his.

Then, the sound of the horn was heard that signified the end of the battle.

Puuuuuu!

A sound that made you flustered any time.

“Waaaaaaa! Victory!”

“Complete victory! Complete victory! “

“Rose troop! Hurray! Hurray!”

The soldiers yelled.

It had already been two months since monsters started to appear in the eastern region.

And now, it was rose troop’s 21st battle and they were all complete victories.

Roan waited for a moment so the soldiers could savour the victory.

“Waaaaaaaaa!”

When the yells calmed down a bit.

He yelled towards the soldiers while he still had his spear at his side.

“After we clean up the corpses, we repair the road, and we carve hollows and ditches for defensive purposes!”

“Yes! Understood!”

The soldiers replied with excited voices.

They quickly moved and started to gather the corpses of the kobolds and goblins in one place.

At the same time, they carved ditches and hollows at the sides of the road.

Roan looked at that for a moment and then moved outside the forest.

He could see the cavalrymen running from far away when he left the entrance.

They were the cavalrymen squad of Rose troop that included Gale and Keniss.

‘It seems like the subjugation of the plain also turned out well.’

The expression of Gale, who was running at the front, was bright.

Nonetheless, Gale laughed with a big voice and yelled as soon as he arrived.

“Hahaha. This battle was also a complete victory.”

“It’s all because of troop commander’s amazing commanding skills.”

At Roan’s words, Gale shook his head.

“No. No. Although I said it immediately, the reason we achieved complete victory is all because of you.”

A proud smile was on his face.

“It’s amazing to notice the stir of the monsters beforehand, but it was even more amazing that you precisely guessed the estimated region and time that the monsters would appear.”

At those words Keniss added.

“You really are worthy of being called the ghost of the battlefield.”

The ghost of the battlefield.

Roan thought once again that it was fortunate that he didn’t become a battlefield fortuneteller.

“I just guessed from the rumors and the stories of the citizens.”

He spoke in a humble attitude and voice.

“Anyways, what’s amazing is amazing.”

Gale was astounded.

Then, Keniss asked with a careful voice.

“But is Istel kingdom really behind the stir of the monsters?”

“There’s a high possibility.”

Roan nodded.

‘According to the analyzed information, Istel kingdom already finished their preparations for war.’

Until now, the situation and the time was similar to his past life.

‘Should I say that this is fortunate…….’

A bitter smile appeared on his face.

Gale let out a sigh with an uneasy look.

“Whew. We are setting up defensive lines in the eastern region for now with the monster subjugation as the excuse……”

Roan knew the reason he was being uneasy.

‘Benjamin Doyle. That stupid bastard saw the report of corps commander Aaron and ignored it.’

When he first reported the stir of the monsters and the movement of Istel kingdom to Gale, Gale reported it to Aaron.

As he already knew about Roan’s abilities very well, he didn’t have any doubts or hesitation.

And Aaron also sent the report to Benjamin, who was the commander of the eastern region, right after he inspected the contents.

But.

Don’t make a fuss over some monsters running around a bit.

What returned back to them were blame and reproaches.

Although Aaron sent the report, it was perfectly ignored.

In the end, he also sent the report to some corps commander he was friends with and were pouring all of their strength into making a defensive line.

‘That Benjamin bastard is making things difficult again.’

It was Benjamin that did nothing right even since his past life.

But even so, it was fortunate that some corps moved thanks to Aaron’s efforts.

‘Even if those Istel bastards come charging, we won’t crumble in an instant.’

In his past life they lost half of the eastern region because of the sudden attack.

At least, they wouldn’t get pushed back that helplessly in this life.

‘We have to endure until the corps of other regions and that stupid bastard prepares for battle.’

That was something he could do plentily.

At least, if it went according to Roan’s plans.

But when did life flow as you wished?

One soldier approached and saluted.

“Sir. Vice troop commander Roan. Someone called Pens is looking for you?”

“Mmm?”

If it was Pens, it was one of the staff members Chris had.

Roan slightly bowed towards Gale and Keniss and then followed the soldier.

Pens was roaming a bit far away from the entrance of Oat forest.

He bowed towards Roan and then took out a small piece of paper from his chest.

“Boss Chris sent me.”

“Thank you.”

A hint of nervousness showed on Roan’s face. .

He didn’t know why it didn’t feel good.

He carefully spread the paper and checked the contents.

And then his expression stiffened.

The letter started with a sentence that would not please anyone. .

I have a bad premonition.

Chapter 65




After the first sentence, the contents of the letter became worse.

While I was gathering information on the eastern region, I heard some rumors from travellers that bothered me.

Even so, it seems like the movement of the Byron kingdom isn’t right.

For now, I’ll go there myself to check.

The contents of the letter were simple.

Roan frowned.

‘Byron kingdom?’

This was something he hadn’t expected at all.

‘In my past life they didn’t show any movements until next year……’

There was no way something this important would be wrong.

Then.

‘The future changed again.’

Also with their movements, this was a really bad position for Roan.

He tore the letter and put it into his pocket, and then looked at Pens.

“Then, mister Chris…..”

“Yes. He left four days ago.”

“Right. You’re all working hard.”

At those words, Pens hurriedly shook his head.

“No. They’re all working having fun as if it was their thing.”

At those words Roan slightly bowed.

“I will ask you to take good care of me.”

“I, I will do my best.”

Pens also bowed.

Roan became locked in his thoughts by himself after he separated with Pens.

‘I really can’t know when the future will change.’

The worth of the information agency could be seen because of this matter.

‘I did well in focusing on gathering information of the eastern region.’

The decision of not relying solely on his memories made him see light.

‘For now, let’s leave the side of Byron kingdom to mister Chris.’

There was nothing Roan could do right now.

There was also a possibility that the rumor Chris heard was fake.

‘The thing I should do now……..’

Stop the stir of the monsters and prepare for the attack of Istel kingdom.

He shook his head and looked towards the east.

There lied Istel kingdom.

He felt like the smell of the battlefield passed by his nose.

******

Roan concentrated on subjugating the monsters while he waited for Chris.

When the subjugation ended, they set up camps or fences according to the topography and also dug ditches and holes.

People who knew that the movements of Istel kingdom weren’t normal were only soldiers with ranks above adjutant.

Normal soldiers still thought that the defensive lines were for the stir of the monsters.

“It slightly resembles the shape of a defensive line for now.”

As Benjamin ignored Aaron’s reports, some holes appeared at places, but even so as they did their best even if Istel kingdom came attacking immediately. They were confident in tying down their opponent’s feet for now.

Then one soldier approached.

“Vice troop commander. Someone called Chris is looking for you.”

At those words, Roan’s face brightened.

‘You finally came.’

It had already been 20 days since Chris left towards Byron kingdom.

As there was no news at all, he felt uneasy.

Roan hurriedly moved to meet him.

He could see Chris who was looking at him while standing still.

‘It seems like the trouble he went by wasn’t ordinary.’

Chris looked kind of haggard.

His hair was bushy and he looked dirty.

But even so there was a satisfied smile on his mouth.

‘It seems like he gained some accomplishments to be satisfied about.’

Roan ran towards Chris and grabbed his hands.

“I was worried because there was no contact.”

“As the atmosphere over there was too solemn, I couldn’t contact you as I wished.”

Chris shook his head.

“You have done well.”

“No. I just did what I had to.”

At Roan’s words, Chris shook his head once again.

And then looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“I gained some big achievements.”

Roan just listened.

Chris continued saying.

“If I were to tell you the conclusion first, it is that the people of Byron kingdom are also preparing for war.”

He took out a pile of papers from his bag.

It was the information about the southern region of Byron kingdom which he organized.

“Mmm.”

Roan received the papers.

‘Certainly. Just why did the future change now? In my past life……..’

He suddenly brought up the memories.

The reason why Byron kingdom couldn’t move as they wished.

But he couldn’t remember the detailed situation of the kingdom.

‘How stifling.’

It certainly would have changed because of one of his choices.

Then, Chris’s voice was heard.

“Although I couldn’t acquire internal information, it isn’t precise. But even so it seems like the two kingdoms have held hands.”

“It seems so.”

Roan said.

Historically, Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom were just like cats and dogs.

Compared to that, Istel kingdom was on friendly terms with both Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom.

But even so, if you had to choose a friendlier side, it would be Byron kingdom.

There was plenty of possibilities for the two of them to have held hands.

‘The objective in this war for Istel kingdom would be to advance on their western territory.’

The exact objective was revealed only after the war ended.

It certainly was like that in his past life.

‘The situation is turning difficult.’

Roan let out a long sigh.

Then, Chris said as if he was whispering.

“But I conjured a hypothesis on why Byron kingdom became able to participate in this war.”

He had a somewhat hesitant look.

“Um…….I think that the reason is because of our kingdom.”

“Our kingdom?”

Roan frowned at the unexpected conjecture.

Chris nodded.

“Yes. We achieved a complete victory at the Pedian plain’s monster subjugation. Compared to last year, he gave them a loss almost close to annihilation. Especially, the ones with the biggest losses…….”

Roan continued speaking.

“The orcs of the north…….”

“That’s right.”

Chris nodded.

He continued speaking.

“There were many guys that set up attack lines to attack Byron kingdom. But they were all annihilated……..”

“The southern region of Byron kingdom became inactive.”

“That’s right. Even Violin ended up dying in the Slen battle. In the position of Byron kingdom, they are at a situation where they shouldn’t even have to worry about the orcs in the south.”

“Mmm.”

Roan gulped the silence.

‘I never expected that the results of Pedian plain and slaying Violin’s head would become like this.’

But of course, there were still many other orc commanders aside from Rak in the northern region of RInse kingdom.

‘But they are living in the northern region of our kingdom. Rather, our side is in more danger.’

Anyways, different than his past life, he thought he now knew the reason why Byron kingdom could prepare for war.

But of course, this was all a hypothesis of Chris’.

He couldn’t actually know what kind of black curtain there was.

‘I will have to report it to corps commander Aaron. However……’

Even if he did that, he didn’t think a sharp response would come back.

It was obvious that Benjamin would ignore the report.

But even so, he couldn’t just report it to the king’s palace while ignoring the army rules.

No, at this time he didn’t even have the means to.

His pondering deepened at this large dilemma.

Chris looked at that face of his.

He also knew much about Roan’s ponderings.

‘Isn’t there be anything I can be of help with?’

Chris mulled over his thoughts over and over again.

‘Ah………!’

Although it wasn’t a clever scheme, he still thought of one method.

“Vice troop commander Roan.”

Chris called out to him in a low voice.

Roan moved out of his thoughts and looked at Chris.

Chris faintly smiled and continued to speak.

“Should I spread a rumor?”

“A rumor?”

As Roan asked back, Chris nodded.

“We spread a rumor that the movements of Byron kingdom and Istel kingdom aren’t normal around the capital of Miller and the northern region. Wouldn’t a rational commander, who’s not like commander Doyle, pay a bit of attention to it?”

“Mm.”

Roan gulped.

“It doesn’t seem to be that good of an idea.”

“Ah, is that so?”

“First of all, it’s not easy to spread a rumor because the time and human power is limited. But most of all……”

His face stiffened.

“If that kind of rumor roamed around, the citizens would feel uneasy.”

“Ah……..”

Chris let out a low exclamation.

He couldn’t move the feelings of the citizens just to make the commanders move.

“Normal people fear war a lot. If a rumor about Byron kingdom and Istel kingdom wanting to attack us spreads, an ensuing chaos would occur. Because for them, it would look like we aren’t prepared at all. If we are to spread a rumor, it would have to be after our preparations are solid.”

“I was short in my thoughts”

Chris slightly bowed.

He was a bit moved.

“I think that you’re really amazing. To think of the safety of the citizens first in this urgent situation.”

At those words Roan sighed.

“Whew.”

He looked at the village that was located at the south of the plains.

“Can you see that small village?”

“Yes? Ah, yes.”

Chris followed Roan’s sight and turned his head.

He could see a small but peaceful village.

Different than the soldiers who were setting up fences or digging ditches, the village men were solely focused on taking care of the harvest.

It was a scene that made you feel warm when you looked at it.

“It’s really pleasing to watch, right?”

“Yes. It feels like i’m getting happy.”

At Roan’s question, Chris faintly smiled and nodded.

On the other side, Roan’s expression was kind of dark.

“If we can’t perform our roles well, their lives will get stepped on.”

Even if his voice was low.

It was completely different to his positive and bright look.

Roan closed his eyes.

The smoke filled the sky.

The village that was peaceful and beautiful.

The cries and yells heard in his surrounding.

The ground wet in blood.

A horrible scenery happened in front of his eyes.

It wasn’t something he made up with his imagination.

These were the memories of his past life.

‘The things that happened in the war against Istel kingdom………’

No, it wasn’t only during the war against Istel kingdom.

Everywhere war happened, a horrible scenery followed behind it.

‘I can’t let that happen again.’

That was what Roan wanted to do.

A real monarch didn’t betray his citizens.

Roan wanted to become that kind of monarch.

He slowly opened his eyes and looked at Chris.

“Mister Chris.”

He spoke in a low voice but with strength.

“Help me so I can help them.”

“Ah……..”

Chris exclaimed with a deeply moved face.

‘It certainly is sir Roan. If it’s him, if it’s him…….’

He clenched his fists.

‘I can spend all my life with him.’

Determination.

That was an oath of serving.

‘I have to do what I can even better. Help sir Roan to do what he does.’

He started the information agency because it was fun.

But now, he started to feel responsibility from those things.

He started to feel a sense of duty at what he started because of fun.

Today, Chris grew up one more level.

Meanwhile, Roan was wondering how to confront the Byron kingdom.

‘Won’t there be a good strategy……….’

His head spun.

Many strategies and tactics popped up.

But there was nothing good.

Chris, who was looking at that Roan, mumbled in a low voice.

“It’s the first time I miss the orcs this much. Just gathering the scattered ones would be enough to prevent Byron kingdom from moving as they wished.”

At that instant, Roan’s eyes opened widely.

‘Right! Orcs!’

His mouth raised up.

“Mister Chris.”

“Yes.”

“Even so, it seems like we will have to talk for quite a while.”

The smile on his mouth became even denser.

Roan continued saying in a low voice.

“I thought of a good thing.”

*****

“Scatter to the sides!”

“Don’t separate too much!”

“Get a hold of yourselves!”

In the eastern plains of Beno castle, rose troop was training earnestly.

Roan was checking the movements of the troop from a bit far away and recording the lacking points.

‘For now, we have safely evacuated the residents to a safe zone.’

Now, there wasn’t much time left until the attack from Istel kingdom.

They couldn’t leave the residents alone when they didn’t know when war would break out.

They gave the excuse that they couldn’t ensure their safety because the stir of the monsters was too severe.

And fortunately, the citizens reacted well to the instructions.

Because even for them, monsters frequently appeared in this region.

‘What’s left now is waiting for the answer from the transcript of the north……….’

The preparations were finished.

‘Whew!’

Roan let out a long sigh.

Then, the head of a war horse appeared at the end of the plain.

‘Mm?’

The war horse whipped up white dust and ran quickly.

As Roan focused on his sight, the warhorse that was far away was seen as if it was right in front of him.

“Ah……”

At that moment, a low exclamation came out.

He had clearly seen it.

That the soldier was holding a red flag.

‘Is it starting?’

Roan bit his lower lip and raised his right hand.

Flop! Flop!

At Roan’s handsign, the flagman shook his hand and the troop stopped their movements.

They had lined up while setting up a rectangle formation.

When each adjutant and squad commander stood in front of their spot.

The warhorse that was running through the plains came closer.

Flop! Flop!

The red flag that waved around with strength.

Roan and the soldiers moved their sight over the warhorse.

At the same time, the soldier riding it yelled with strength.

“The people of Istel kingdom have crossed the boundary!”

Chapter 66




Sponsored Chapter

“Uak!”

These were cries that resounded in your ears.

A fatty, who had his neck sliced open, walked two steps and collapsed.

Clark trembled and stepped back.

‘Ho, how……’

He couldn’t believe the scene in front of him.

‘How are the bastards of Rinse kingdom……..’

The bastards approached them while holding spears and swords.

It was revealed that they were the soldiers from rose troop, of the 7th corps of Rinse kingdom.

‘Why are you bastards over here!’

Clark wanted to yell like that.

‘I know that there aren’t any troops stationed over here……..’

He was certain.

Because it was something he had studied over and over for more than a month.

‘It just seems like they already knew of our surprise attack.’

Clark grinded his teeth.

HIs teeth clashed without stopping.

His breath was clogged at the fear of not knowing if he was going to die.

‘Damn. I wanted to make Beno castle fall faster than anyone.’

He thought that Rinse kingdom wouldn’t have made any preparations.

But that wasn’t only Clark’s thoughts.

Everyone thought like that and thought that the battle would flow normally.

‘Wrong. We were wrong.’

Then, he felt a chilly presence when he was stepping back.

Clark stopped and turned around.

“Huk!”

He saw a spear that was right in front of his nose.

Clark couldn’t endure it and fell down.

“Are you the troop commander?”

The owner of the voice was someone with a spear.

Clark looked up while he was on the ground.

It was a childish face but had a somewhat rugged charm.

He was none other than Roan.

“Reveal your name and unit.”

Roan brought his spear to Clark’s forehead.

“Kugh.”

Clark frowned.

He had already resigned everything.

“I’m troop commander Clark of Pier troop of the 1st corps of Istel kingdom.”

Clark honestly revealed his unit.

‘It certainly was the Pier troop.’

The soldiers of rose troop who were surrounding him along with Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

“Did you know that we were going to attack?”

Clark regretted having asked that to Roan.

‘Someone who’s soon going to die has asked a meaningless question.’

He smiled bitterly.

“Let me know the name of the bastard who will take my head.”

Roan looked at Clark’s eyes fixedly and put strength into his wrist.

Swush.

The spear soared high to the sky.

“My name is Roan. I’m the vice troop commander of rose troop of the 7th corps.”

At the same time, the spear fell towards Clark’s head.

Clark listened to the sharp noise and closed his eyes.

Slash.

The spear instantly cut off his neck.

The body that lost its head slowly fell over.

Boom.

Roan shook his spear and waved the blood off.

The cries and yells in his surrounding had now calmed down.

‘The first battle is a complete victory.’

A smile appeared on his face.

The beginning of the war started off on a good foot.

‘At this point, the news of an infiltration attempt from Istel kingdom would have reached the eastern headquarters.’

Now that the situation turned out like this, even the stupid Benjamin wouldn’t be able to just sit still.

‘Even so, as Count Lancephil moved first, we could cover up some big holes we had in our defensive lines.’

Aaron reported this to Io instead of Benjamin, and Io lead the knights himself after confirming the situation and marched.

‘But it’s still lacking.’

To face Istel kingdom, he needed the forces of the eastern region and also an army provided by the palace.

‘We will hold until then.’

He didn’t need a complete victory like this one; to the point of completely massacring their enemies.

They just needed to tie their feet to not let them advance deeper in towards the kingdom.

But even so, it wasn’t that they had leisure in terms of time.

‘Byron kingdom would also have started advancing…….’

Although they also crossed the boundaries, they were advancing while riding the eastern boundary.

‘It would be to join with Istel kingdom.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘The 3rd and 4th corps have to do well……’

He hatched a plan after having a conference with Aaron before the war started.

And that was that the 3rd and 4th corps had to face Byron kingdom in the north while the eastern region battled against Istel kingdom.

But of course, they didn’t have to battle with putting their lives on the line.

Battle 20 times and lose them all.

Their objective was pulling them into a deep part of the northern region.

There were two things he could gain by losing every battle.

‘I will make them be off guard.’

But what was more important.

‘We have to make the supply line as long as possible.’

If they pulled Byron kingdom deep inside their territory, they could only get further away from their provisions.

This was because of the speed difference of the troops and the movement speed of the supplies.

Because of that, the supply line gets longer and their military forces becomes thinner.

That was the point Roan was aiming for.

‘If the warriors of the north attack them there……..’

Byron kingdom would fall in chaos.

No, it wasn’t only chaos.

‘A troop without supplies can’t continue doing war.’

Supplies were that important in a war.

But of course, it wasn’t an important plan.

The moment one of his small plans deviated, Rinse kingdom would have brought a tiger to their den.

‘They have to accomplish their respective roles well.’

Then, a familiar voice was heard from his back.

“Roan. It’s a complete victory. Complete victory.”

As he turned back, he saw Gale and Keniss approaching him.

They were slightly inspired at the complete victory.

“Where do we have to move next?”

Gale asked while looking at the battlefield.

Roan replied in a low voice.

“We have to wait until the information squad arrives.”

“Ah, information squad. Right. Right.”

Gale let out a low exclamation and nodded.

He looked at Roan’s face.

‘Information squad….. Was there a person that made that and even used it in a war?’

When he first heard that Roan wanted to make an information squad, he couldn’t easily understand it.

Because he thought that just using the patrolling guards were enough.

On top of that, he thought that it was nonsense to make a non battling squad when they were already at a disadvantage in numbers.

But when they made the information squad as per Roan’s opinion, they could only get amazed at their role.

‘Although they can’t figure out all of the information, they are able to grasp their movements.’

Having waited in ambush beforehand at the moving route of Pier troop was also because of the strength of information.

He looked at Roan with amazed eyes.

‘He’s looking at me like that again…….’

Roan smiled awkwardly and looked away.

Nowadays, whatever happened, he always looked at him with those eyes.

Amazement, respect, awareness.

But of course there was envy, annoyance, and jealousy mixed in at times, but those were scarce.

Roan was receiving an overwhelming support from everyone.

‘Anyways, it seems like it was a good thing to make an information agency.’

In the first place he was planning to utilize Chris and his staff to gather and analyze information.

But for a normal person, that wasn’t a soldier, to roam the battlefield was one of the most dangerous things to do.

Because of that, he chose soldiers that had good eyesight and were nimble to make an information squad.

‘Mister Pens is leading them well.’

The squad commander wasn’t a soldier, but a staff of Chris’s agency, Pens.

‘After this, I will have to make Chris’s travel agency a formal information agency.’

The significance of information will be seen the more time has passed.

Before that, he needed a more systematic organization.

‘The time to start the agency has come.’

The best information group that grabbed all the information in the continent in his past life.

The agency.

The time came to make the first step.

*****

Chris was fruitful in gathering information about Istel kingdom because of the use of the agency and information squad.

Fortunately, their movements weren’t that different to Roan’s memories.

Roan’s memories and the information gathered together.

The two things were combined and made a more precise and valuable information.

Because of that, the 7th corps and the other three corps could set up a defensive line before hand in Istel Kingdom’s attack line.

After four days of having set up wooden fences and strong barricades, did the people of Istel kingdom appear.

Their numbers were as much as 80,000.

Compared to that, the amount of the four troops were as much as 30,000.

“Amazing.”

Aaron was astounded.

Even the other corps commanders gulped down dry saliva.

What was fortunate was that the location of their barricade was good.

No, precisely speaking, the location of Istel kingdom’s camp was bad.

They could only take place somewhere in the empty plain because Rinse kingdom had already set up their barricade.

“It’s just like Roan’s information and the report of the information agency.”

Aaron glared at the end of the plains with a satisfied expression.

He was amazed once again at Roan’s ability and quick eye.

Then, Mendel appeared with an urgent expression.

“Corps commander.”

Aaron and several corps commanders had turned their head and looked at Mendel.

Mendel continued saying with a stiffened expression.

“30.000 soldiers of the eastern army arrived at the Nerf region.”

Nerf region was one day away from here, Bink region.

“Ah……”

The corps commanders exclaimed and put on relieved expressions.

But Mendel’s expression was still hard.

And Aaron didn’t miss that.

“It seems like something happened.”

“That…..”

Mendel chewed his lower lip and hesitated.

And then, spoke with a slightly agitated expression.

“The eastern army set up a camp in the region of Nerf.”

In that instant, the corps commanders frowned.

“What?!”

“What did you say?”

They had expressions as if they couldn’t believe it.

For their allies to set up a camp in a region that was a day away from this place, that already had a camp set up.

It was something they couldn’t understand at all.

“Commander Aaron. If the eastern army set up a camp in the region of Nerf, shouldn’t we also fall back?”

“Oho. Do you think that makes sense? Will the enemies just sit still while we retreat over to the region of Nerf?”

The commanders discussed among themselves and pondered.

And Aaron was also the same.

‘Benjamin Doyle. You really are a pain in the ass.’

Benjamin had big ambitions, but was too frightened.

He certainly would have gotten scared at the 80,000 soldiers of Istel kingdom and set up a camp in their rear.

‘Retreat? Or protect this place? Whatever we do, it isn’t a good situation.’

Then, Mendel’s voice was heard.

“How about calling Roan?”

“Roan?”

Aaron turned his head and looked at Mendel.

Mendel swallowed down dry saliva and nodded.

“Yes. If it’s Roan, won’t he have something good?”

“Mmm. Right. If it’s Roan……..”

Aaron touched his chin and nodded.

“Good. Call him.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Mendel deeply bowed and left.

The commanders that were discussing looked at Aaron.

“Who’s Roan?”

“I hear that name a lot…..”

“Ah! Is he the soldier that received a corps commander level badge…….?”

At those words Aaron nodded.

“That’s right. Ale gorge battle, Pedian monster subjugation tactic, Int’s forest battle, Prely river inundation tactic, Slen battle, and the invasion of Istel kingdom and Byron kingdom. These distinguished merits were all accomplished by vice troop commander Roan.”

“Ah…..”

The commanders exclaimed out loud.

‘So he’s outstanding in strategies and tactics?’

‘They say his spear skills are also amazing.’

‘There’s a rumour that he went toe to toe with Viscount Baker.’

The commanders glanced at each other and had a smile mixed with expectation.

After a while, the door opened and Roan appeared.

‘This childish youth is that Roan?’

‘He’s much smaller than what I thought.’

‘I heard that he was young, but he’s a complete greenhorn.’

The smiles on their faces disappeared.

An uneasy look appeared again.

‘I was also like that at first.’

Aaron looked at them and bitterly smiled.

‘But they will soon be amazed at Roan’s abilities.’

Just like him from the past.

“Did you call me?”

Roan saluted towards Aaron.

After Aaron nodded, he told him the truth that Benjamin set up a camp in the region of Nerf.

Roan bowed with a composed expression.

‘Benjamin Doyle. You are making things really difficult.’

However, he had kind of expected that the scaredy cat would have set up a camp at their rear.

‘The problem is whether Istel kingdom set up a camp in the region of Bink, just like the analysis of the information squad.’

The result.

‘Fortunately, it’s like we guessed.’

Then, there was no need to worry.

“The situation isn’t good. Do you have a good method to deal with them?”

This was Aaron’s question.

Roan replied as if he was waiting for it.

“We have to prepare for a night raid.”

At that instant, Aaron and the other commanders all frowned.

“Night raid?”

“Did he say night raid?”

“Are you telling me that Istel kingdom will launch a night raid?”

They all laughed.

‘They say that rumours tend to be excessive………’

‘The merits he had accumulated until now would all have been a bluff.’

The commanders looked at Roan and shook their heads.

Then Philip Hass, who was the commander of the 5th corps and the one with the most experience, clicked his tongue.

“Tchtchtch. Look. Don’t you know that it has already been nine days since they crossed the boundary?”

“Yes. I know.”

Roan bowed.

The person who had reported that Istel kingdom had crossed the boundary was right himself.

Philip continued saying as if he was rebuking.

“An army consisting of 80,000 appeared in Bink region nine days ago. It’s quite a fast, no, a movement speed so fast you can’t even imagine it.”

“Right.”

The other commanders all nodded.

Phillip looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“This means that they slept and ate the least amount possible and moved night and day. It means that it’s an amazing forced march. But they attempt a night raid the moment they set up a camp? Do you think that’s possible?”

He was making fun of him.

The other commanders also laughed.

“Hahaha. It seems like he doesn’t know about these things as he hasn’t faced a war this big yet.”

“Now that I see it, the merits he accumulated were all done while facing the ignorant monsters.”

They were pouring out cynical remarks.

But there wasn’t any change in Roan’s expression.

He pointed at the end of the plains with his finger.

The camp of Istel kingdom.

“Look at their camp.”

At those words, they stopped laughing and turned to look at the camp.

80,000 soldiers had set up camps while scattered about.

“Even if their number is amazing, the structure of their camp is too sloppy. This is just like they set it up however it turned out.”

Roan’s words were true.

Although it was difficult to set up a camp because the numbers were big, even taking that into account, their camp was excessively unsteady.

Aaron mumbled as if he thought of something.

“That feels like they just camped down temporarily.”

At those words Roan nodded.

“That’s right. They aren’t thinking of staying in that place for long.”

Then, Philips said.

“Ho! Did you judge that they will make a night raid just by looking that? Just with that one reason?”

He clicked his tongue and shook his head.

Even the other commanders didn’t falter.

However Roan’s expression was still composed.

He gave Aaron a pile of papers.

“Will you look at this?”

“What’s this?”

“Information about the generals of Istel kingdom.”

At those words Aaron looked at the paper with a surprised look.

‘When did he……….’

There was information written about important commanders on it.

But of course, it wasn’t minute and detailed information.

Their outlines, outer appearances, descriptions, and temperaments.

There also was information written about what merits they had achieved.

‘Although I couldn’t gather internal information, it was made up with the stories of the citizens as the background, but just with that, it became amazing information.’

It was information Chris and his agency gathered themselves while they were preparing for war.

For this they roamed pubs, plazas, slums, brothels, and also markets.

The newly made information that squad soldiers roamed these places and received the role of checking how well this information matched with the reports.

“Commander Aaron. Why are you that surprised?”

“Let me see.”

The commanders stuck themselves next to Aaron.

“Oho!”

“This is really amazing.”

The commanders gulped air.

Roan said as if he was waiting for it.

“The commander in charge of leading the army is Looter Beil. You will know if you see the reports but he…….”

The commanders all turned to look at Roan.

“He has a really strong fighting spirit. Looter Bale has already tried surprise attacks and night raids along the Aimas alliance.”

At those words everyone nodded.

The report was certainly written like that.

‘Even in my past life, Looter Baile decided to go with a night raid when he first met with Rinse kingdom.’

Although the time and place were different, Looter was a commander that had that tendency.

The tendency of the commander and the structure of the camp.

On top of that, Roan’s memories.

The possibility for a night raid was plentiful.

“Hmm.”

Philip smacked his lips and cleared his throat.

He had a somewhat uncomfortable look.

“Then, you are saying that we have to prepare for a night raid, right?”

Anyways, preparing for a night raid wasn’t that big of a thing.

On top of that, if they prepared for it but nothing happened, there wasn’t that big of a loss.

‘If I keep insisting here but they do make a night raid……..’

They would rather face large losses.

The commanders all turned to look at Roan.

Roan matched their sights and shook his head.

“No. We have to prepare for one more thing.”

At those words, Philip frowned.

“We have to prepare for one more thing?”

“Yes.”

Roan replied shortly and took in a deep breath.

He wanted to bring the flow of this battlefield to Rinse kingdom.

Roan continued saying while looking at the faces of the commanders.

“We have to prepare for a counter raid.”

War and more war (4) End

“The night air of Rinse kingdom is really good.”

Looter Beil took in a deep breath.

A chilly smile appeared on his mouth.

‘It’s a good weather to run for a while.’

His sight moved over to the foot of the mountain.

He saw hundreds of big and small barracks and wooden fences surrounding it.

The camp of Rinse kingdom.

At first glance it seemed solid, but Looter couldn’t know.

‘By now, they should be asleep right?’

Rinse kingdom would be careless.

‘They would think that we are dead tired.’

Not at all.

He didn’t think about that at all.

‘Stealth like surprise attacks and raids are my specialty.’

The gale of Istel.

That was the nickname of Looter.

On top of that, he had a reason why he could only go with a night raid.

‘The king said that the one with the most outstanding merits would receive half of the occupied territory.’

Half of the eastern region of Rinse kingdom.

He could only want it.

That was the reason why a corps commander like himself went out to do a night raid regardless of doing a forced march.

“Corps commander. We have finished preparations for the raid.”

At the soldier’s report, Looter faintly smiled and nodded.

‘Then, shall we also run a bit today?’

He went towards the entrance.

5.000 cavalrymen were showing a dignified look.

The horses had their mouths covered with a gag and the horse shoes were covered with cloths filled with grass.

Looter raised his right arm high.

“Let’s show the strength of Istel kingdom to the Rinse bastards.”

“Yes.”

A low reply came from them.

A weird nervousness flowed with the wind.

“Charge!”

Looter grabbed the reins and walked.

He was pulling and walking the horse to not make any sounds.

5,000 cavalrymen followed behind his back.

5,000 cavalrymen.

That was the most suitable number to do a night raid.

‘We retreat quickly after having messed them up.’

Even so, it wasn’t that it ended with just one night raid.

When they were confused, he was planning to try raiding it once more.

‘It wouldn’t even cross their minds.’

A smile appeared on Looter’s face.

He was the happiest in this moment.

Joy covered his body.

Soon, he could see the wooden fences that were set up in a solid fashion.

‘We are charging in one go.’

Looter got up on his horse and took in a deep breath.

And the others also did the same.

He uncovered the gag of the horses and kicked them.

Dudududu.

The warhorse fiercely charged and then jumped over the fence nimbly.

Behind him, 5,000 soldiers followed him.

“Set it on fire! Run amok as you wish!”

“Waaaaaaaaaa!”

The soldiers, who were holding their breaths, let out cries.

They crumbled the bonfires and set the big and small tents on fire.

They were really spirited.

However, it didn’t last long until they realized that something wasn’t right.

“Huh?”

“Uh?”

The soldiers who were setting things on fire stopped with a perplexed expression.

Silence.

An uneasy silence roamed inside the camp.

They didn’t see guards nor soldiers that got out of the tents.

‘Damn! Something is wrong!’

Looter looked at his surroundings and grinded his teeth.

Tens and hundreds of tents were burning, but the people of Rinse kingdom didn’t even stick out their noses.

Then, a sharp noise was heard.

Sweeeee!

‘Arrow!’

Looter instinctively pulled the reins and moved towards the back of the burning tent.

At that same moment.

Pubububuk!

A rain of arrows poured over the cavalrymen.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh!”

They became porcupines who were not able to prepare themselves, and collapsed.

‘Damn! The Rinse bastards were already aware of the night raid!’

Looter clenched his fists with a frustrated look.

“Retreat! Retreat!”

The raid was a failure.

Retreating was the only option left if they wanted to live.

“Retreat! Retreat!”

The cavalrymen repeated the command and pulled the reins.

They dodged the pouring arrows and ran towards the entrance of the camp.

But.

“When you enter, you can come as you wish. But if you want to leave, you have to receive permission!”

“Where do you want to go?!”

Thousands of swordsmen and spearmen lined up following the fence.

At the same time, cavalrymen appeared inside the camp.

It was a perfectly encircled situation.

‘Damn. I can’t do anything in this situation!’

Looter grinded his teeth.

There were no methods.

No, there was only one order he could lay out.

“Pierce through!”

And that was piercing through the blockade and returning to their camp.

At Looter’s orders, the cavalrymen started to run towards the swordsmen and spearmen.

And Looter also followed his back.

“Block them!”

“Raise your spears!”

“Stab the horses!”

The spearmen of Rinse kingdom raised their spears high, grouped together, and made a root formation.

It was to stop them from piercing through.

Bang!

The people of the two kingdoms clashed.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The sound of metal clanging together was heard along with sparks.

An unavoidable battle occurred.

The spearmen and swordsmen didn’t get pushed back easily.

And they didn’t even let them pierce through.

Because of that, Looter and the 5,000 cavalrymen were trapped inside and wavered.

Meanwhile, the cavalrymen of Rinse kingdom attacked their backs.

“Let’s show the strength of Rinse kingdom to these bastards!”

“We will send you to hell!”

A really spirited cry rang out.

The cavalrymen of Rinse kingdom pushed the other cavalrymen fiercely.

The cavalrymen of Istel kingdom collapsed helplessly at the attack from both sides.

“Kugh.”

“Kek.”

These last words were heard everywhere.

‘Damn! Can’t keep like this!’

Looter grinded his teeth and went to the front.

“Damn! Get away! Get away!”

He pulled up his mana and massacred the spearmen and swordsmen.

Slash! Stab!

The power of mana was amazing.

Looter faced the normal soldiers who had a big build like he was facing kids.

Every time he swung his blade, one or two soldiers lost their heads and collapsed.

“The ones that don’t want to die get away! Get away!”

Looter yelled.

The soldiers and spearmen hesitated and fell back.

They became scared at his overwhelming power.

‘Normal soldiers can’t face a corps commander that knows how to use mana.’

Roan, who was facing the normal soldiers at a place a bit far away grinded his teeth.

‘If I leave them be, our losses will only increase!’

He couldn’t let them just dielike that.

He cut off the neck of one cavalryman charging at him and then looked towards Austin and Keep.

“Austin! Keep! Make me a foothold!”

Austin and Keep, who were facing the cavalrymen, understood Roan’s orders in an instant.

The two people put the spears at both of their sides and looked at Roan.

Roan slightly nodded and then charged forward.

One thread of mana surged up from his mana hole.

The muscles of his two legs twitched and were filled with energy.

Austin and Keep looked at each other and then rebounded their knees.

‘One, two, three!’

At the same time, Roan stepped on the two spears and jumped.

Pat!

Roan surged to the air using the rebound strength of the spear and his kicking strength.

Roan lightly jumped over the cavalrymen and flew towards Looter.

“Huh?”

“Uh?”

The cavalrymen of Istel kingdom looked at him and had surprised expressions.

Looter, who was massacring the soldiers, discovered that Roan was flying towards him too late.

“This imposible………!”

Looter hurriedly tried to pull back the spear to hit Roan, but it was already too late.

Roan’s spear pierced the air and stabbed in towards Looter’s chest.

‘Damn!’

Looter twisted his upper body unavoidably and dodged below the horse.

Stab!

Roan’s spear fell in the place he dodged.

The spear was deeply stabbed into the horse.

Hiiiiiiing!

The horse cried roughly and shook its body.

Roan kicked the head of the horse like that and lightly landed while out pulling his spear.

Meanwhile, Looter who was rolling on the ground with a perplexed look, glared at Roan and fixed his posture.

“Who are you?”

“I’m vice troop commander Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps.”

“Vice troop commander? Not even a general, but a mere adjutant? Hmph!”

Looter snorted and raised his longsword.

“Looter Bale of the 1st corps of the western forces of Istel kingdom will cut off your neck.”

He thought little of Roan.

Although he was at the intermediate-low level, his body had learned mana.

He wasn’t at a level where a normal soldier could face him.

But of course, this guess of his was completely wrong.

Tat!

Looter got up from the ground quickly and ran towards Roan.

This was because it was dangerous to keep distance while facing someone holding a long distance weapon such as a spear.

Roan looked at Looter charging at himself and grinded his teeth.

‘I’ll get rid of him when he’s careless.’

He couldn’t use mana openly.

Roan swung his spear with all his strength.

It wasn’t a simple spear technique, but Roan’s spearmanship.

Spat!

A sharp sound was heard along the spear.

“Hph!”

Looter, who was charging in boldly, gulped some air and swung his sword.

Cheng!

A pleasing sound of metal against metal rang out.

The spear was bounced off to the side.

‘Kugh. Certainly, the strength of mana……’

Roan grinded his teeth as he felt his palms going numb.

However, it wasn’t to the point that he couldn’t endure it.

He moved his two arms close to his body and pulled the spear that was bounced off with all his strength.

The spear that had lost its direction once again turned to attack Looter.

‘Damn!’

Looter grinded his teeth and swung his sword when he looked at the spear that continued softly.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Sparks appeared alongside the noise of metal sound.

At first glance, they were even.

But Looter was getting closer to Roan little by little.

Tuk.

Finally, Looter’s right foot reached Roan’s left foot.

“Die!”

Looter tried to stab him with his blade.

This was the critical moment.

However, Roan’s expression was still composed.

‘I waited for this!’

He inserted mana to his eyes.

At that instant.

Pat!

The movements of the people became sickeningly slow and the whole world was dyed in golden light.

The golden light that filled his sight was mana.

Roan just looked at Looter’s sword that was coming into him.

‘So mana moves like this.’

As the proficiency he currently achieved was low, he couldn’t grasp everything clearly. But, he could guess that the mana was flowing towards the blade from Looter’s mana hole.

Most of all, the mana that moved along with Looter’s movement was clearly seen.

‘I’m ending it here.’

Roan already felt his eye getting hot.

As he used mana and also Kalian’s tear, his eye was beginning to feel the burden.

He quickly twisted his body to dodge Looter’s blade and then he closed in on him.

Swuuuuush.

A really slow movement.

Although Roan was also moving while utilizing mana, the movements he saw by utilizing mana was so slow, it could make him yawn.

‘Reid’s battling technique.’

He grabbed the spear with his right hand and executed the basic stances of Reid’s battle technique.

Swush.

The fist moved towards Looter’s abdomen.

“Kuuuuuuugh.”

The sound of Looter gulping down the sound became loud.

At the same time, he closed in on the shoulder that was swinging the sword and he twisted his body.

Spaaaaaat!

Roan’s fist barely missed Looter’s abdomen.

At that moment, he felt an expression of relief from Looter.

‘There’s no need to like it that much. As this isn’t the end.’

Roan pressed down the shoulder with the fist that missed.

At that instant, the balance crumbled and his whole body twisted to the left.

It was a look that seemed like they would fall to the ground.

Roan wasn’t perplexed and then pulled his left arm to his right side and turned his body.

At the same time he wrapped Looter’s legs with his right leg.

Tuuuuuk!

Looter’s leg was trapped between his thigh and calf.

“Uhhhhhhhh!”

Looter’s surprised voice became long.

Roan just pulled his leg like that.

Looter couldn’t endure it anymore and lost his balance.

Looter slowly collapsed.

Then.

‘Kugh!’

Roan blinked at the pain he felt in his eyes.

At that instant, the world that was dyed in golden light turned to its original look.

Looter, who was falling so slowly it made you yawn, collapsed in an instant.

Boom!

“Uhh.”

Looter couldn’t get a hold of himself.

‘Damn! To wrap my legs in that situation.’

It was an attack he hadn’t expected at all.

‘It’s dangerous like this!’

He tried to turn his body quickly and stand up.

At that moment.

Puk!

He felt a strong shock in his side.

“Kuhuk!”

A feeling like his breath was cut shot through him.

Roan had kicked his side.

Looter flipped and spread out while looking at the sky.

Tuk.

Roan aimed at Looter’s throat with his spear.

Looter had a helpless expression.

“Kugh. Damn. To fall by a normal soldier and not even a general.”

He let out a sigh.

“Whew. Is the Gale of Istel ending here?”

At those words Roan put strength in his hands.

“You blew somewhere where you shouldn’t have gone in the first place.”

At the same time, the spear moved.

Slash.

A line appeared on Looter’s neck and then, his head became separated from his body.

Roan stabbed the head with his spear and raised it high to the sky.

“Vice troop commander Roan of rose troop from the 7th corps has slain the neck of the enemy commander!”

A loud yell resonated out.

“Huh? Corps commander Beil?!”

“Ah…….”

“Impossible.”

Even so, the army of Istel kingdom that was getting pushed back one sidedly, looked at Looter’s head and suffered a setback.

The bastards that were struggling until the end threw their weapons and surrendered.

“Hahaha! Roan! It’s a complete victory. A complete victory!”

Aaron approached while riding his horse.

He also saw the other commanders at his back.

They were a bit surprised as the night raid had happened just like Roan had predicted it.

Aaron looked at the big and small tents that were on fire.

“Put the fires out!”

If they acted later, the whole camp would be covered in fire.

Then, Roan stepped up.

“It would be good to put the fire off later.”

“Huh?”

Aaron asked back what he meant.

Roan looked at the camp of Istel kingdom that was located at the other side of the plains.

“If we catch the fire quickly, they may realize that the raid had failed. Now, rather than putting it out……”

He put strength in his voice.

“It’s time to go for a counter raid.”

“Right. It may look like we are the ones in chaos.”

Aaron nodded.

After that, he prepared 5,000 cavalrymen with Mendel at the front.

Behind them, more than 10,000 infantrymen moved into formation.

“Then, we will also depart after we cover the horses with gags.”

Mendel had a really spirited expression.

At that look, Roan shook his head.

“No. It would be good to let the 5,000 cavalrymen advance like this.”

“Like this? Are you telling me that we have to advance without covering the horses with gags in a frontal attack?”

At Mendel’s question, Roan nodded.

“Our camp is already on fire. And Istel kingdom will also be looking at this. They will be thinking that the raid was a success. Because of that, when 5,000 cavalrymen approach their camp they will think that their allies are returning to the camp after having succeeded in the raid.”

“Ah! Right. It will be impossible to check if they are friends or foes in this dark night!”

Roan nodded.

“Yes. So don’t advance while covering the horses with gags, but instead approach them as fast as possible and the moment you enter their camp, set it on fire and run amok as you please.”

Continued by that, he looked at the 10,000 archers.

“Followed by that, the spearmen and swordsmen will sweep them up.”

At those words Mendel nodded.

And Aaron and the other commanders also did the same.

“Let’s do as Roan says.”

At Aaron’s order, Mendel slightly bowed and moved out of the camp while he was leading the cavalrymen.

Dudududu.

The sound of horse steps was clearly heard.

At the same time, the 10,000 swordsmen and spearmen left the camp without any sound.

They had all covered their faces and armour with dirt.

Because of that, they became one with the darkness.

And of course, the one in front of the 10,000 soldiers was Roan.

Sasasasak.

They crossed over the long grass.

A dense smell of blood was wafting through the air.

When they approached the camp of Istel kingdom.

Waaaaaa!

Flames surged up from the insides of the camp.

Roan’s eyes shined.

‘It’s now our turn.’

War and more war (5) End

Chapter 68




‘What? How did this happen?’

Prain, who was in charge of guarding of the camp, didn’t have any control.

Even until flames surged up in the camp of Rinse kingdom and noises were heard, he thought that the raid was a success.

And it was also because the fire wasn’t put out, but it spread even more.

After a while, when thousands of cavalrymen were coming back to his camp, he thought that Looter was returning.

The reason he had opened the gates with a really happy voice was also because of that.

But the cavalrymen that entered the camp wasn’t Looter’s army.

‘They, they are from Rinse kingdom!’

Prain came to realize this too late.

He yelled towards the guards.

“Ri, ring the bell! Ring the bell and hit the jing!”

He had to let the others know of the infiltration by the enemy.

He had to let the others know that the raid was a failure and they were the ones getting attacked.

“Ye, yes!”

The soldiers who were checking the situation with absent-minded expressions ran towards the bell and the jing.

Then.

Sweeeee!

A sharp sound was heard.

Pubububuk!

“Kugh!”

“Kek!”

Then, the soldiers fell by becoming like porcupines.

At the same time, the people of Rinse kingdom came pouring in from the open entrance.

“Kill them!”

“Set everything on fire and collapse the tents!”

“Break the stables and release the horses!”

The 10,000 soldiers entered the camp recklessly.

“Huh?! Uh……..”

Prain stepped back with a perplexed look.

‘This large scaled surprise attack……..’

He had never thought that they would attack them, they had lower numbers in the first place.

‘I, I have to let the commanders know of this!’

Prain turned back and tried to run towards the camp.

At that moment, he felt a chilly presence at his back.

Stab.

At the same time, the sharp spear pierced the back of his head.

“Attack! Everyone attack!”

The owner of the voice yelled out.

The one who stabbed the back of Prain was Roan.

Stab.

He pulled his spear and charged the ground.

“Uoooooooo! Wha, what’s happening!”

“It’s a surprise attack!”

“Damn! Ar.. armour! Bring me the armour!”

The soldiers of Istel kingdom were really confused by the sudden attack.

Because of the forced march that lasted nine days, they were really exhausted.

Thanks to that, they just believed in Looter’s night raid and rested without thinking of anything else.

As the army of Rinse kingdom appeared in this situation, the soldiers couldn’t even wear their armour and got out of their tents holding their weapons.

And that was the same for adjutants and generals.

“Kuhuk! How, how are the Rinse kingdom……”

“What happened with corps commander Beil!”

“Kugh.”

They yelled with a really perplexed expression.

“Block them!”

“Stop the fire!”

The commanders got a hold of themselves and led the soldiers.

But at the unexpected attack, they were in chaos.

Stab. Slash.

And Rinse kingdom didn’t miss this opportunity.

A one sided massacre and annihilation occurred.

“Bastards of Istel kingdom, fuck off to Istel!”

“Return to your land!”

“Die!”

The soldiers of Rinse kingdom attacked them with raging bellows.

Everyone swung their own weapons.

But even amongst them, the most outstanding one was Roan.

He was mixing Kalian’s tear, Brent’s ring, and the Flamdor mana technique suitably and showing the prowess of a monster.

Swing. Swing.

The spear turned roughly by riding the palm.

And everytime, several soldiers of Istel kingdom collapsed while shedding blood.

“Kugh.”

“Kek!”

Roan didn’t show any mercy, even to the fallen ones.

‘I can’t leave any future trouble.’

If it wasn’t a situation where he could completely subdue them, he had to certainly kill them.

That was his ethics in battle, battlefields, and war.

The battle flowed one sidedly, but even so it wasn’t a situation where he could loosen himself.

‘If I make a mistake, I can get by legs grabbed.’

A raid was a raid.

If he became greedy because he was drunk in victory, he could suffer a big blow.

They were inside a camp with more than 8,000 soldiers anyways.

“Staff officer Mendel! Going deeper than this is dangerous!”

At Roan’s yell, Mendel who was fiercely pushing back the enemies pulled back the reins.

‘We moved deeper in than what I thought.’

As he slew the bastards of Istel kingdom that fell helplessly, he turned up entering to a deep place even without knowing.

“Fall back! Fall back!”

Mendel turned the head of his horse and yelled with strength.

Likewise, the cavalrymen that were pushing back the enemies started to retreat one by one.

‘Even so, it’s fortunate that we didn’t fall into a trap or become surrounded.’

When he thought until then.

A really displeasing sound was heard.

Sweeeeee!

A sharp sound rang out.

But it was heavier and more horrible than when a normal arrow pierced the air.

When Mendel thoughtlessly turned to look back.

Puuuuk!

A long spear pierced three cavalrymen alongside the terrible sound.

At the same time, the men of Istel kingdom scattered to the sides.

“Mm?”

“Huh?”

Mendel and the cavalrymen had surprised expressions at the sudden situation.

Their sight moved to the insides of the camp.

From between the split army, a group of people that were wearing flashy armour appeared.

Likewise, Roan also opened his eyes roundly.

‘They are knights!’

An existence he didn’t want to face at all.

Different than normal soldiers, knights knew how to use mana.

But fortunately, their number wasn’t that big.

At most, 30 men.

But even with just that, it was a number that you couldn’t just ignore them.

“Re, retreat! Retreat! We are falling back quickly!”

Mendel instantly grasped the situation.

He looked at the knights that were approaching them fiercely and yelled.

Hiiiiing!

The cavalrymen that hurriedly kick their horses.

But unfortunately the movements of the knights were a bit faster.

Stap! Slash! Spat!

A sharp long sword slashed the cavalrymen.

“Kuok!”

“Kek!”

The cavalrymen fell helplessly.

‘Damn. For the knights to appear this quickly……..’

Roan ground his teeth.

In the raid group of Rinse kingdom’s army, there weren’t even ten people who knew how to use mana.

‘It’s one of the biggest weak points among weak points.’

One of the biggest weakness that an army guarding a region had was the presence of knights and mages.

Only staff officers and the small minority of troop commanders knew how to use mana.

A really small minority at that.

Most belonged to the army of a region or a noble family.

Because of that Roan, Gale, Aaron, etc. wished for a more active participation from the region’s army.

But Benjamin ignored the report and they had set up a camp at their rear.

‘Are the only ones I can believe in are Count Lancephil’s knights and the region’s army?’

Roan bit his lower lip.

At Aaron’s report, Io reacted right away.

But he was the owner of Lancephil’s territory.

He couldn’t just ignorantly step out to defend the boundary.

‘They have to get rid of Istel kingdom’s army who are sweeping up the territory.’

Because of that, they were late in joining.

Compared to that, as Istel kingdom was on the invading side, they had some knights in their ranks.

Only that as the knights were quite an important force, there was a large possibility they would be staying at the rear of the camp.

‘I thought that they wouldn’t show themselves until a full scaled battle happened.

Roan let out a sigh.

‘If the mage squad appears like this……..’

This would become a trouble beyond troubles.

They had already achieved a great victory in the raid.

‘We have to hurriedly retreat.’

If they suffer a big blow here, then succeeding in the raid became meaningless.

Roan gripped the spear tightly.

He saw the knights massacring the cavalrymen.

‘Hmm.’

His eyes shone.

‘I thought that the knights appeared quite fast, but they are all greenhorns.’

Although they certainly show great might, their movements were big and unnatural.

‘They are just guys that are in their apprenticeships.’

They were guys that were deployed probably to accumulate real experience.

‘Then……….’

When they were still drunk in the heat of the battlefield.

They wouldn’t have any mind of themselves as they were busy slaying the soldiers in front of them.

‘Hph.’

Roan took in a deep breath and pulled some mana.

A heat that spread out while flowing into his palm.

He threw his spear with strength.

Sweeeeek!

A sharp sound.

The spear showed a chilly intent and split the air.

One of the knights who was massacring the soldiers snorted when he looked at the flying spear.

“Hmph!”

He was confident in being able to block a spear that was thrown by a normal soldier lightly.

The young knight didn’t even dodge the spear and lightly swung his blade.

Then, the voice of a man that was leading the knights was heard.

“Don’t block it and dodge!”

“Huh?”

Only then had the young knight realized that something was wrong and twisted his body, but it was already late.

Puk!

Roan’s spear pierced the body.

“Grr.”

His neck snapped along with the last words.

The young knight died with having a spear pierced in his body.

‘Impossible!’

The knights who were looking at the scene, looked at the spear with a surprised look.

‘A knight couldn’t block a spear thrown by a normal soldier?’

‘Is it possible to throw the spear from that distance, pierce the body, and stab it into the ground?’

Everyone’s eyes shone with doubt.

Then, Mendel and the cavalrymen hurriedly ran towards the rear.

“Huh?! Catch them!”

“Kill!”

The knights got a hold of themselves late and tried to kick off the ground.

There was a soldier that rushed into the insides of the camp, different than the cavalrymen that were retreating.

He had empty hands that didn’t have a spear or a sword.

The youth with the childish face was Roan.

He charged the ground and jumped to the air.

‘I have to buy a little time!’

He just needed to buy time for his comrades to retreat.

He was confident in being able to buy that much time while facing the greenhorn knights.

Mana flowed into both of his fists.

‘Reid’s battle technique.’

It wasn’t only at the level of imitating the movements while holding a spear.

What Roan tried to execute was the basic technique of Reid’s battle technique.

The two fists split the air while moving in a strange fashion.

“Crazy bastard!”

The young knights swung their swords with all their strength.

They were stiffened by the sudden death of their comrade.

They had realized that death was quite a close to them.

They had smelled the smell of the battlefield, the smell of death.

Swush.

Roan dodged the sword by moving his upper body and then turned.

At that short moment, his two fists split the air.

Pububuk!

The body of the young knight was hit by Roan’s fists.

The flashy armour became bent and squashed.

“Kuk!”

The knight staggered at the shock that shook his insides and fell.

Roan hurriedly took away the sword of the knight and stabbed it downwards.

Stab.

The long sword was stabbed into the neck of the young knight like that.

“Huh?!”

“This son of a bitch!”

The other knights realized the situation too late and attacked Roan.

Roan calmly breathed in, and then threw the blade along with the corpse of the knight.

“Damn!”

“Kuk!”

The knights that were charging in were surprised and dodged.

And Roan didn’t miss that moment.

He hurriedly threw his body to the ground and grabbed the spear stuck in the ground.

Puuk!

He kicked the knight that had the spear pierced in his body and put strength in his hand.

Spat!

The spear rose to the sky.

Roan turned his body following the spear and pulled some mana.

The allied soldiers were retreating to the entrance of the camp.

There was no need to hide his use of mana right now.

Paat!

The spear that had mana split the air as if it was dancing.

Roan executed the strong techniques consecutively.

“Kugh! This bastard! You weren’t a normal soldier!”

“Be careful! The strength behind the spear isn’t normal!”

The knights realized Roan’s true strength too late.

In this instance, the one who was in a situation difficult was Roan.

Although he was practicing Flamdor mana technique and Reid’s battle technique, the actual training time wasn’t that long.

If 30 knights assaulted him at once, he wouldn’t be able to do a thing.

‘I have to fall back before it becomes even too late for me.’

Roan clearly realized when he had to step in and fall back.

That was the precious experience and intuition he obtained while roaming the battlefield for 20 years.

The spear that had mana behind it, split the air and stabbed towards the body of a knight.

“Where!”

But the knights, who got ahold of themselves late, didn’t face Roan’s spear sloppily.

The moment they swung their swords to knock away the spear, they twisted their body to the side.

It was a movement to completely dodge the strength behind the spear.

But the next movement Roan did, completely missed the knight’s common sense by a lot.

Spat!

Roan threw away the spear he was holding.

Sweeee!

It was a sudden javelin throw.

The knights looked at the spear thrown in front of them and hurriedly dodged.

As they saw that their ally had just died because the body was pierced by the spear, they couldn’t even think of blocking it.

‘Okay! Now!’

Roan didn’t miss that opportunity

He hurriedly charged and threw his body.

He was attacking them fiercely but started to fall back.

“Ca, catch him!”

“Don’t lose him! We have to at least catch him!”

An enemy that used mana was an existence you had to capture or kill.

The knights chased Roan’s back a step behind him.

“Block!”

The normal soldiers of Istel kingdom blocked Roan’s fleeing path.

This was the moment of life or death.

However, Roan’s eyes calmly sank.

‘Left, right, right again, after that I make him fall by putting my feet………’

Because of Kalian’s tear, he could grasp all the information in an instant.

Spat!

Roan moved his body to the sides and ran while dodging the soldiers.

Swong.

When a sword or a spear was about to reach him, he grabbed the neck and arm of a soldier and pulled him.

“Huh?! Uh!”

“No, no!”

Perplexed yells came out of their mouths.

Slash. Stab.

A horrible sound.

The soldiers of Istel kingdom stabbed their weapons into their allies, and not Roan.

“Damn!”

“Don’t swing your weapons mindlessly!”

At their spears and swords, an ally died.

That truth made the soldiers completely stiff.

Because of that, Roan’s movements became even more natural.

Pabat!

He soon reached the entrance of the camp.

Then, a displeasing sound was heard from his back.

“Kuhk!”

“We, we are allie……….”

The yells of Istel kingdom’s soldiers.

As Roan glanced back, he saw one knight charging at him fiercely.

A huge body with a thick lined face.

He was the commander of the greenhorn knights.

He, who seemed to be in his thirties, was running in a straight line while pushing away the allies in his front.

“Bastard! Don’t dodge and receive my sword!”

He had a voice that was like thunder.

He was Vernon Pollet, who had an outstanding skill in the blade, even amongst the young knights.

Although his skills were outstanding, he was quite hot tempered he was called the crazy bear of Istel.

Roan fell the soldiers at his side and charged forward.

This wasn’t a situation to battle him leisurely.

Then, he saw a warhorse roaming in the insides of the camp.

‘Good!’

Roan changed directions and ran towards the warhorse.

“Hmph!”

Vernon snorted and followed Roan’s back.

As the level of mana operation was in a higher level, the distance between the two of them was closing in bit by bit.

Hiiiiing.

The cry of the horse was heard close by.

It was at a distance that seemed to be right in front of his nose.

But rather than the distance between the horse, his distance with Vernon was much closer.

“Stop!”

Vernon yelled and raised his sword.

He was in a really risky situation.

Then, Roan’s eyes shined.

‘That!’

His sight moved to the sides.

‘Okay!’

He was looking at something others couldn’t see.

A smile appeared in his face.

A faint sound was heard.

Sweeeeee!

A sharp sound.

However, Roan kept running to the horse and didn’t show much of a movement.

Meanwhile, the distance between them closed even more.

“Die!”

Vernon tried to hack down the sword he had raised up.

Then.

Spat!

One arrow passed next to Roan’s left ear as if it grazed him.

At the same time.

Puk!

The arrow was stabbed into Vernon’s left eye along with a horrible sound.

“Uaaaaaaaak!”

Vernon, who was about to slash Roan in any moment, collapsed with a cry.

It was a situation that would make you surprised, but Roan didn’t even look back and just charged forward and then jumped.

Hiiiing!

The rough cry of the horse that was spread out.

He pulled the reins and kicked the horse.

Dudududu.

The horse ran outside the camp.

“Uaaaaaaaa! My eye! My eye!”

Vernon’s yell was heard from his back.

Pubububuk.

The arrows the soldiers of Istel fired off late fell behind his back.

Roan stuck his chest close to the horse.

The place he was heading to wasn’t the camp of Rinse kingdom.

It was to a place outside the line.

One youth was guarding that place alone.

Roan didn’t lower the speed of the horse and extended his left arm.

“Grab it!”

At the loud yell, the youth also extended his hand.

Pat!

He grabbed Roan’s arm and then lightly jumped and got on the horse.

Roan turned the head of the horse towards Rinse kingdom’s camp.

He yelled towards the youth at his back.

“Harrison! I was able to keep my life because of you!”

The youth that was guarding the place was none other than Harrison.

Harrison let out a long sigh.

“Honestly speaking, I wasn’t confident.”

At those words Roan shook his head.

“There wasn’t even an inch of mistake. It barely grazed my ear and it stabbed the left eye of that bastard.”

That one arrow that saved Roan’s life.

The person that fired that was none other than Harrison.

He had a really excellent ability.

Harrison looked at the camp that was already close and yelled.

“The raid was a success!”

At those words Roan brightly smiled and shook his head.

“No, no.”

And then yelled with all his strength.

“It’s not a normal victory, but a great one!”

Different to his bright expression, his eyes sunk calmly.

Roan mumbled in a low voice.

“Although the war has just started…….”

Chapter 69




Sponsored chapter!

The surprise attack was a big success.

They almost didn’t have any casualties and the enemy camp became a sea of fire.

On top of that, they slew the only capable commander, Looter.

This was a real big success.

“How about attacking once more?”

Aaron carefully asked while looking at the enemy camp that was on fire.

Roan shook his head.

“No. Although they wouldn’t have any control because they are putting the fire off…..”

Roan looked at Aaron and the commanders and continued talking.

“Now, it would be good to retreat.”

At those words, everyone frowned.

“Retreat? You want us to retreat after attaining this victory?”

Roan nodded with a calm expression.

His eyes calmly sank down.

‘If I get to raise a force, the first thing I have would to do would be changing the commanders.’

The actual Rinse kingdom, no, the majority of the kingdoms that were located east of the Grain mountains operated by approximating numbers.

Especially in the cases of corps commanders, many were part of a baron’s family but the problem was that they attained their ranks without having any relation to their skills.

‘Even in this place, excluding corps commander Aaron Tate, and Phillip Hass, the others are all commanders in name.’

The others were the ones who spent their lives as corps commanders without having any merits to back them up because of the excuse of being the eldest son of a noble family.

‘In the selection of a commander, abilities and human nature should come first.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

It was time to convince the commanders who only knew how to fight boldly without any abilities.

“The enemy knights are already outside of their camp. On top of that, the mages would also have finished preparations. Compared to them, we don’t have knights nor mages. If we were attacked in this state, we would suffer big losses. And if it turned out like that, the success of the surprise attack becomes meaningless.”

“Mmm.”

At the stipulation about the knights and mages, the commanders shut their mouths.

Phillip, who was the eldest, nodded.

“It was also Roan that guessed the surprise attack and proposed counter attacking them. I think that it’d be good to also listen to him this time.”

His attitude had changed a lot from when he first met Roan. He was different than the other commanders who were only greedy without having abilities to back them up. Because he had been in the battlefield for a long period of time, he didn’t have any unnecessary greed or stubbornness.

‘We can’t keep ignoring him when he has showed such amazing performance.’

Although his eyes were dark, he had recognized someone with the abilities.

“I think that would be good.”

Aaron added and came to a conclusion.

“Then, let’s retreat immediately.”

As the situation turned out like this, Roan quickly revealed his thoughts.

“I think it would be good to first make the infantry retreat while lighting up the torches and leaving the tents intact.”

At this statement, Aaron and Phillips immediately realized his reasoning.

“You want us to seem like we’re protecting this place.”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Roan brightly smiled and replied back.

Aaron called Mendel and sent out the order of retreat.

And then, the whole camp started to move busily.

“Roan.”

Aaron called out Roan separately.

Roan slightly bowed and approached.

“The merits you’ve achieved by slaying the enemy commander and succeeding in the surprise attack is really big. I will certainly reward you after the war ends.”

“Yes. Thank you.”

Roan saluted shortly afterwards.

A proud smile appeared on Aaron’s face.

‘He’s someone that I really don’t want to let go of.’

He was someone he liked more and more the more time passed.

‘As he slew a corps commander of Istel kingdom……..’

If he did well, he may be able to give him a title of nobility; a title of at least a baron.

This would be his incorporation into the noble’s world.

‘I’ll have to show my strength at least once.’

But to do that, it was important to attain victory in this war.

After a while, Mendel approached and bowed.

“We have finished the preparations to retreat.”

Aaron faintly smiled and looked at the other commanders.

‘I can’t leave them behind.’

Retreating to Nerf region, where the camp of their allies was located, was the safest path.

“My 7th corps will stay behind.”

As soon as Aaron finished speaking, the other commanders had surprised expressions.

“Oh! Will you really?”

“You’ve made a really difficult decision.”

They became happy at the truth that they would be able to retreat to a safe zone first.

Aaron bitterly smiled as he looked at their expressions.

‘The person that is suited to be in that position is Roan.’

He was talking about the bastards that occupied the seats of a commander just because they were nobles.

He felt bitter.

“Then, I will leave it to you.”

Phillip approached and extended his hand.

Aaron grabbed that hand and said the same thing.

“Then, I’ll leave it to you.”

Phillip, who realized what that meant, smiled bitterly.

After a while, the commanders left the camp while leading the infantry with Phillip at the front.

As the retreat happened really quietly in the middle of the darkness, Istel kingdom didn’t realize it at all.

Aaron looked at the back of the commanders getting farther away and let out a sigh.

“Whew. Nothing has to happen.”

At those words, Roan and Mendel bitterly smiled.

“Does something have to happen?”

Aaron nodded.

“Right. As commander Hass is there, would something really happen?”

He awkwardly smiled and looked at Roan.

As a result, Roan also faced him and smiled.

But they couldn’t expect it at all.

That the maybe would catch the person.

*****

When the sun rose, the 7th corps also started to prepare their retreat.

Roan stood in the middle of the empty camp and extended both of his arms.

“I think that it would be good to start a fire and make smoke appeared as if we are eating.”

“Oh, that’s a good method.”

Aaron nodded with a satisfied expression.

Soon, they lit up three thousand fires to make it look as if they were boiling soup and heating up bread.

They gathered plenty of branches and leaves on purpose and made it smoke.

The tents that were also set up on purpose took place along the fence.

“We will place scarecrows at the front of the camp.”

“Right. They will be suspicious if there aren’t any guards.”

Aaron nodded.

The soldiers used spears and weeds to make a scarecrow.

And they also put armor over it.

Although it was a scarecrow without doubt when you looked at it closely, it was enough to trick the Istel’s soldiers that were far away.

Aaron looked at the insides of the camp and took in a deep breath.

“We will have to retreat.”

“Yes. From now on, speed is life.”

Now, the camp of Istel kingdom’s disorder was controlled a little.

If they were late, they would get their tails caught.

Roan looked at Istel kingdom’s camp fixedly.

Because of Kalian’s tear, he saw the camp as if it was right in front of him.

‘They’re already preparing to attack.’

The soldiers of Istel kingdom were maintaining their camp and moving around busily.

‘There’s no more time to waste.’

Roan set an eye sign to Aaron.

Aaron nodded and climbed his horse.

“We retreat as quietly as possible.”

The hoof of the horses, that were covered with pieces of cloth, stepped on the ground without making any noise.

The remaining cavalrymen left the camp in an instant.

Three thousand fires and hundreds of scarecrows protected their empty camp.

*****

“Let’s repay the disgrace we suffered last time!”

Corps commander Baron Wett Landel of Istel kingdom raised his sword high and yelled.

“Waaaaa!”

The soldiers of Istel brought up their morale even when they were tired.

They knew how important morale was in a battle.

“Charge!”

Wett yelled with all his strength and pulled the reins.

He was quite excited.

‘The commander has left his seat.’

He planned to grab this opportunity.

‘Although Looter failed, I will succeed.’

If he won this battle, he would raise huge merits.

If that was the case, he would receive half of the obtained territory as a reward for his merits.

Wett mobilized a large scaled army and crossed the plains.

He closely approached the Rinse kingdom’s camp and yelled with strength.

“Bastards! Cowards of Rinse kingdom! Don’t stay hidden like that and fight!”

What he wanted was a confrontation in the plains.

But even if Wett and the soldiers yelled, the camp was still quiet.

Wett frowned.

‘Something is wrong…….’

Normally, when a side asked for a battle in between the two camps, the opponent had to reply to them.

Because of that, Wett led 10,000 soldiers and left his camp.

This was to be a battle between 10,000 soldiers.

He was confident in achieving victory with just his capabilities.

But the camp of Rinse kingdom was as quiet as a dead rat.

An uneasy feeling was felt in their backs.

Then, the closest person to him and the staff officer of the corps, Arr, approached him.

“Doesn’t it seem weird?”

“Right?”

Wett frowned and asked back.

Arr turned his head and pointed at Rinse kingdom’s camp.

“Even the guards that were standing guard by the fences didn’t show any movements.”

“Mmm.”

Wett frowned and raised his right hand.

“Archers, to the front!”

At those words, the archers came to the front and readied their bows.

“Fire!”

As soon as the order was sent, thousands of arrows split the sky.

Sweeeeeeeeeee!

A sharp sound rang out.

Pubububuk!

A rain of arrows poured over the camp of Rinse kingdom.

Even the guards that were on the fences became porcupines.

However they didn’t yell or fall; they kept protecting their places.

Then, Wett frowned and yelled.

“Damn! Even if it’s wrong, it’s completely wrong!”

He grabbed the reins and started to ride towards the camp.

“Co, corps commander!”

Arr was surprised and followed his back.

Soon, all the remaining soldiers started to charge towards the camp with hurried looks.

Bang!

The entrance that was seemingly closed, opened up.

Wett, who went into a deep part of the camp, clicked his tongue with a hopeless look.

“Ho! We were completely done in.”

The camp was completely empty.

The guards that were guarding the fences were scarecrows made from weeds and spears.

On top of that, thousands of braziers were taking place at the back of the camp.

Arr, who arrived late, discovered a piece of cloth between the braziers.

‘What’s that?’

He grabbed the piece of cloth and then frowned.

“What’s that?”

As Wett asked, Arr brought him the piece of cloth without saying anything.

There were letters written in it.

You have done well coming all the way here. Make some food with this.

“Thi…..this! Fucking!”

This was a major insult.

They were thoroughly conned.

Wett tore up the piece of cloth and ground his teeth.

His sight moved to the west.

“I will certainly pay back this humiliation.”

*****

The 7th corps that quickly left the Bink region, soon arrived in Nerf region.

“I can see the camp of our allies.’

Aaron pointed a huge camp that was placed at the side of a mountain.

The placement of the camp showed that it didn’t have any thoughts to attack.

‘You gave up the whole eastern region starting from Nerf?’

Aaron clicked his tongue and shook his head.

And Roan also did the same.

‘The problem is that his ambition is great for someone that frightened.’

Because of that, there were many cases where Benjamin spoiled things at important moments.

‘I can’t just let him be like this.’

But he couldn’t do anything right now.

Roan was merely a vice troop commander of the army in the region.

‘I have to grab an opportunity. For Rinse kingdom, no, at least for me I want to chase him away.’

And fortunately, Roan was confident in being able to do so.

‘He’s someone who makes a lot of mistakes.’

He was waiting for the opportunity to completely chase him away.

While he was thinking about this and that, the front of the 7th corps entered the camp.

“It’s corps commander Aaron Tate of the 7th corps.”

At Aaron’s words, the guards saluted and then opened the entrance.

As he moved inside the camp, many scattered soldiers approached.

“You achieved victory while facing the Istel kingdom?”

“Based on the words that arrived yesterday, they say that the strategy was planned by the 7th corps.”

“Nowadays I hear a lot about the 7th corps.”

They mumbled while looking at the soldiers of the 7th corps.

It seemed like rumors were being spread by the soldiers of the other corps.

“Uhm.”

“Ahem.”

The soldiers of the 7th corps raised their chins up and widened their shoulders at the proud feeling.

Then, a group of people showed themselves from a deep part of the camp.

The group consisted of Benjamin, the staff officers, and the corps commanders.

Aaron and Roan hurriedly got off the horse and bowed.

“Oh! Corps commander Tate!”

Benjamin brightly smiled and faced Aaron.

However, he was boiling inwardly.

‘Damn. If I had known that Istel kingdom was that weak, I would have set up the camp in Bink region.’

He missed the opportunity to accumulate merits.

Benjamin was angry at that and felt regret.

“I received the report from Phillip Hass. You’ve truly achieved an excellent merit.”

Aaron slightly moved his sight and looked at Phillip.

Phillip bitterly smiled and shook his head.

His expression was somewhat bad.

Benjamin continued speaking.

“But you made one mistake.”

He clicked his tongue as if it was regrettable.

“Why didn’t you push back Istel kingdom even further when you had already achieved victory?”

“That……”

When Aaron was about to reply with a calm voice.

Benjamin shook his hand.

“Anyways, it’s regrettable. It was an opportunity to annihilate them. So I was saying……”

In the first place, he didn’t even want to listen to Aaron’s story.

Benjamin continued saying with a chilly expression.

“From now on, I’ll lead the soldiers myself and intercept the bastards.”

Aaron didn’t say anything.

‘He’s looking down on them.’

His heart scattered because they blocked the Istel kingdom’s attack with just three or four corps, and also gave them a big blow.

‘I now know the reason why Phillip Hass’s expression wasn’t good.’

Probably some other commander would have been seduced Benjamin with sweet words.

‘Stupid bastards.’

Istel kingdom wasn’t that easy of an opponent.

Benjamin grabbed Aaron’s shoulders.

“You should be tired because you raised big merits in this battle and even retreated while protecting the camp until the end.”

His next words felt somewhat weird.

“That’s why I’m going to exclude you from the next battle out of consideration for you.”

“Yes? But……”

Aaron frowned and raised his head.

He could see Benjamin’s face right in front of him.

He had an expression that was smiling but was somewhat severe.

Pressure and overpowering intent was felt from his eyes.

“But what…….?”

Benjamin repeated Aaron’s last words.

Aaron tightly bit his lower lip and bowed.

“The 7th corps is to rest and then annihilate Istel kingdom when they get nearby.”

In one sentence, he was leaving the main part for himself and giving him the leftovers.

Aaron couldn’t reply easily and ground his teeth.

Benjamin looked at that and snorted.

‘You’ve already raised a big merit. I can’t let you accumulate more merits that catch the eyes of others. On top of that Aaron, you bastard………’

He wasn’t even on his side.

If he kneeled down and pledged allegiance to him, he was thinking of using him, but now this wasn’t the case.

He felt rotten when he saw that he was acting friendly with Reil.

“Then, I’ll be asking you.”

Benjamin didn’t even listen to Aaron’s answer, and disappeared to the insides of the camp.

The staff officers and commanders followed his back.

Phillip, who stayed still until the end, approached and grabbed Aaron’s shoulders.

“Corps commander Tate. It’s useless. Although I tried to express my opinion, as the mouthing of the others was too strong……”

Phillip let out a long sigh.

Aaron forcefully smiled and shook his head.

“You didn’t do anything wrong.”

The two looked at each other and smiled bitterly.

Phillip just nodded instead of replying, and then walked away.

Aaron looked at him getting further away and let out a sigh once more time.

“Whew. How untrue.”

It wasn’t that he was greedy in accumulating merits.

However, it felt like he was everything taken away from what he had done.

Then, Roan approached.

“Roan. It’s useless. Everything was taken away by them.”

Aaron couldn’t even look into Roan’s eyes properly.

However, Roan’s expression was quite composed.

No, there was rather a faint smile in it.

He whispered in Aaron’s ear.

“No. Rather, it turned out well.”

Aaron opened his two eyes widely.

Roan continued speaking.

“The opportunity for us to end this war has come.”

Chapter 70




Roan knew the reason as to why this damned war was happening.

The war between Istel kingdom and Rinse kingdom.

As soon as this war had finished in his past life, Rinse kingdom analyzed and organized the information about the reasons this war started and the process with a fine-toothed comb.

‘We were about to lose almost all of the eastern region, including the territory of Count Lancephil to Istel kingdom.’

In that process, some truths were revealed, and Roan remembered a few of them.

One of them was the reason why this war started.

‘The harvest had slowly started to decrease since last year.’

The Istel kingdom, whose land was mostly composed of plains, was one of the best agrarian countries.

They exported their harvests and imported the products they lacked, and they made a living like that.

The overwhelming amount of harvest productivity was the root and trunk of Istel kingdom.

But last year, the harvests suddenly started to decrease with no apparent reason.

‘Although they barely held on for a year…..’

This year’s harvest was even worse than the last year’s.

They didn’t even have crops for commerce, and it was to the point it made you worried as to what the citizens had to eat.

And the reason was of course, unknown.

On top of that, Rinse kingdom and Byron kingdom, who neighbored their borders, didn’t show any signs of their harvests having decreased.

As the situation turned out like this, the Istel kingdom had to make a decision.

However, it was even difficult to ask for help from the neighboring kingdoms.

‘In the end, they opted for war.’

They aimed for the eastern region of Rinse kingdom.

It wasn’t as large as the plains, but it was a mountainous region that had minerals and natural resources in it.

They judged that if they conquered the eastern region, they’d be able to put out the urgent fire of a situation they were facing.

When he thought up to there, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“The opportunity to finish this war has come?”

“That’s right.”

Roan replied with a calm expression.

Aaron gulped and nodded.

“Good. Let’s hear the detailed plan in another place.”

He moved away.

And Roan followed behind his back with a composed expression.

Soon at Aaron’s order, the staff officers and the troop commanders of each region, started to gather ain the tent.

“Roan. What did you mean when you said that the opportunity to finish this war has come?”

These were the words that Aaron said aloud.

At these words, the troop commanders opened their eyes widely.

“The opportunity to finish this war?”

“We can’t even confront them directly, so what opportunity has come?”

Strange expressions were plastered on their faces.

Roan looked at their faces once and then opened his mouth.

“First off, we have to know the reason as to why Istel kingdom is declaring war.”

He explained the reduction of the harvest in Istel kingdom for a while.

“Mmm. For that amazing farming kingdom to worry about what to eat……..”

“Now that I see it, the prices in the markets were overpriced. I thought that it was only temporary…….”

The staff officers and troop commanders showed various reactions.

Aaron certainly touched his chin and shook his head.

“Mhm. For a sudden decrease in harvest, how did that……”

Roan didn’t show any reaction.

‘The reason is revealed after two years but………’

There was no need to say that right now.

Roan looked at their faces and continued talking.

“Just like I’ve told you, the situation of their food isn’t good. It’s already to the point that they have barely prepared provisions for this war.”

At those words everyone nodded.

‘They would have gathered it up by even sweeping through the kitchens of the citizens.’

As they heard the situation, even that wasn’t enough.

‘That’s why they attacked us like that without thinking twice.’

This explained the incomprehensible attacks of Istel kingdom.

That reason was revealed just now.

“Following that, Istel kingdom doesn’t have the ability to maintain war for a long time.”

Roan put more strength into his voice.

“And that’s because before the war even started, we moved the citizens to the rear and cleared up the fields.”

At those words, Gale hit his shoulders.

“Right! It’s obvious for the food, but as we also moved over the livestock, ironware, and tools to the rear……..”

Mendel continued the last part.

“The Istel bastards won’t be able to acquire even an ounce of food.”

“Even repairing tools or acquiring tools is impossible.”

Several troop commanders brightly smiled and nodded.

And a smile also appeared on Roan’s face.

‘In my past life, we weren’t prepared at all for the Istel kingdom’s attack. Because of that…….’

They almost had all of their eastern territory taken away in an instant.

The Istel kingdom acquired supplies from the occupied territories and the war was prolonged.

‘Before the elite troops of the central and southern regions came, we suffered consecutive defeats.’

But it was different in this life.

The Istel kingdom already had their attack stopped once, and above that, because of the performance of the region’s armies that were preparing just in case, their advance became slower.

But even so, it was true that Rinse kingdom was getting pushed back bit by bit.

‘Even so, the only things they can acquire from the occupied territories are weeds.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

Then the voice of Richard, who was leading the special troop, was heard.

“If the supplies of the enemy aren’t enough, do we have to make the front come to a deadlock and make it a long war?”

At those words Roan shook his head.

“If we were only facing Istel kingdom, that would’ve been the right thing to do. But we have another enemy.”

Aaron continued.

“Byron kingdom.”

Roan nodded.

“Yes. That’s right. Right now, Byron kingdom is following the eastern boundary to go to the south.”

Everyone’s faces stiffened.

“If it becomes a long war and Byron kingdom joins Istel kingdom, the problem becomes serious.”

“It would. Because the supply problem Istel kingdom has, the problem would be greatly diminished.”

On top of that, the combining forces of the two kingdoms.

It was a situation that they had to avoid.

“So what do you want us to do?”

“What’s the opportunity for us to end the war?”

The troop commanders who were short tempered urged Roan on.

Roan looked at their eyes fixedly and answered.

“To end this war……..”

His eyes shone.

“We have to cut off the supply line of the enemy and set the supply storage on fire.”

At those words, the troop commander’s showed various reactions.

“Oh! That’s right!”

“If we cut them off from their supplies, even they won’t be able to continue this war.”

The people became amazed and surprised.

“Setting the supply storage on fire and cutting off the supply line means that we have to get inside an army that amounts to more than 80,000. Will that be possible?”

“On top of that, won’t Istel kingdom know that an amazing number of enemy troops are moving in their conquered territory?”

“How will we find the supply storage?”

Their doubtful questions spewed out one after the other.

Roan looked at the various reactions and faintly smiled.

He took out a small piece of paper from his chest.

“I’m utilizing the information agency to find the supply storage and the supply line of the enemy. Although it was fruitless until now, fortunately before we arrived to the headquarters of the eastern kingdom, I was able to receive a good report.”

Roan gave the paper to Aaron.

Aaron quickly read the contents of the paper.

“You found one of the supply lines of Istel kingdom!”

The troop commanders opened their eyes widely while having dull expressions, and burst out with cantankerous laughter.

“Yes?!”

“Is that true!?”

They moved next to Aaron and checked the contents of the paper.

Aaron’s words were true.

Although the piece of paper was quite small, the location of Istel kingdom’s supply line was written in it.

“Rather than attacking the army that has more than 80,000 soldiers, we attack the supply line and the storage.”

Roan continued saying with strength.

“This is the opportunity to finish this war.”

“Ah……”

Low exclamations came out from everywhere.

‘To have found the location of the enemy’s supply line………’

Roan faced Istel kingdom in the 7th corps without rest.

On top of that, he blocked the surprise attack and in addition, gave them a big blow through the counter attack.

Battles kept happening without control.

And Roan had located the supply line and the supply storage while ordering the information agency even when all these other things were happening.

The point everyone was amazed at was this last part.

“What are the probabilities of this information being true?”

At Aaron’s question, Roan replied with a confident expression.

“It’s very high.”

It could only be.

It was information that Chris’s agency and the information agency had gathered, and there were also Roan’s memories.

He vaguely remembered the location of the supply storage.

‘As it wasn’t exact, I needed to double-check it.’

And the results were that he could find a small scaled supply line.

‘If they keep searching with this supply line as the center, they’d be able to find the supply storage facility.’

A storage appeared in his imagination.

‘Then, we’ll be able to end this war with our own hands.’

But he had something to do before that.

“If you saw the report of the information agency, the supply line of Istel kingdom is in enemy territory. We have to charge through and ride straight to the rear of Istel kingdom.”

“Mmm.”

Everyone gulped down.

Roan continued saying.

“A force consisting of 10,000 can’t move in a territory conquered by an enemy.”

“You are saying to divide the army, right?”

At Aaron’s words, Roan nodded.

“That’s right. We have a need to divide the army in the smallest unit.”

His words quickened a bit.

“Aside from making a small scaled troop to attack the supply lines, we have to patrol on enemy territory while annihilating their tributes and gather information about their supply line and storage.”

At those words, everyone nodded.

Aaron stood up after he organized his thoughts.

“Good. We will reorganize the army like Roan said.”

It was a dangerous tactic.

However, if they succeeded they could end this war.

“Rose troop will take care of the first supply line the information agency found. The remaining troops will focus on patrolling enemy territory and grasping the location of the supply storage.”

Aaron looked at the faces of the troop commanders.

“Each troop is to hurry and prepare to depart!”

“Sir!”

The troop commanders saluted and then went out from the tent.

Roan also followed Gale’s back and was about to get out.

“Roan.”

Aaron’s voice was heard.

Aaron grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“You also did a big one this time.”

He had a sincerely thankful expression.

“When this war ends, I will grant you a big reward.”

At those words Roan slightly nodded.

‘When this war ends…..’

His head rolled busily.

Autumn was already ending.

When winter came and the next year also came, Roan had to walk a new path once again.

‘That’s why I returned to the eastern region.’

But of course, to do that, everything had to flow like he planned.

Roan ground his teeth.

‘For now, I will bring us to victory in this war.’

That was the most important thing right now.

*****

“Kek!”

One soldier fell along with that sound.

Stab.

The spear that had pierced his body returned to place.

“Whew.”

The owner of the spear let out a short sigh and checked his surroundings.

Several hundred corpses were spread out in the gorge.

‘This battle is also a complete victory.’

Calm eyes.

Cool expression.

The owner of the childish face was Roan.

‘It’s already the 13th battle.’

Rose troop roamed the eastern territory and battled against Istel kingdom.

No, precisely speaking, they were attacking the big and small supply lines.

And that had already happened 13 times.

“Roan.”

A familiar voice was heard.

As he turned his head, he saw Aaron, Mendel, and Gale approaching him.

“This battle was also a complete victory.”

Happiness could be seen in Aaron’s face.

Gale added.

“Hahaha. Based on the rumors, it seems like Istel kingdom is seriously perplexed.”

“They can only be. The food that has to enter their throat is all next to us. Hahaha!”

Mendel roared out in laughter.

Roan’s tactic was right.

‘Reform the 10,000 soldiers into smaller troops and dig up the Istel kingdom’s territory. And at the same time, find the supply line and supply storage location.’

Istel kingdom was really confused at the performance of the 7th corps.

‘Because of that, each troop could acquire quite the amount of supplies.’

Although they couldn’t find the supply storage yet, they were steadily cutting off the supply lines.

With just that, Istel kingdom that was roaming the eastern territory, fell into a troublesome situation.

“Hahaha! Thinking about the bastards that would be starving makes me feel refreshed.”

Everyone laughed while in a happy mood.

But Roan was the only one that wasn’t that cheery.

‘It’s certainly an amazing accomplishment. But we have to find the supply storage now.’

Only then will they be able to give them a proper blow.

However, none of the troops of the 7th corps could find it.

Aaron looked at Roan’s expression and asked in a low voice.

“Why is your expression that stiff? Is it because of the eastern army?”

The army Benjamin was leading was currently suffering consecutive defeats.

Because of that, the front line was getting pushed back to the Rinse kingdom’s side.

Roan shook his head.

“No.”

“Then is it because of the storage supply?”

At the repeated question, Roan couldn’t reply.

Aaron grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“Roan. There’s no need to feel that urgent. With just this, it’s still an amazing accomplishment. Their advancing speed is slowing down.”

At those words, Mendel and Gale nodded.

However, Roan’s expression still couldn’t be cheerful.

‘If time flows anymore like this, then Istel kingdom will end up joining with Byron kingdom.’

He had to block them from joining forces at any cost.

Then, a familiar faced man showed himself.

‘Was he a soldier of the special troops?’

He was a young soldier that belonged to Richard’s special troop.

The young soldier approached with a bright expression.

“Sir! Corps commander. It’s a communication from troop commander Richard.”

He took out a note from his chest.

Aaron quickly read the contents.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out.

At the same time, his mouth raised up.

“What does it say?”

Mendel carefully asked.

Aaron took in a breath for a moment and then said with a calm voice.

“They have finally found it.”

“Yes? What does…..”

Gale asked back with a confused face.

Aaron looked at Roan properly and brightly smiled.

“They found the supply storage of the enemy.”

Danger inside the danger (1) End

Chapter 71




Sponsored chapter

The soldiers of the 7th corps were hiding behind a low mountain slope.

Their numbers amounted to 4,000.

They had moved in small troops until now, but half of them had gathered to attack the supply storage.

“This is their supply storage, right?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

At Aaron’s question, Richard nodded with a confident face.

“While we were patrolling, we discovered five wagons moving in the middle of the night. We followed them because it was a bit weird, and we ended up in this place.”

The empty lot they were peering down at was surrounded by mountains.

The empty lot was quite wide and flat, taking into account that it was located in the middle of the mountains.

The lot, that had the shape of a gourd, only had one entrance.

Only, they couldn’t see the insides of the lot clearly because it was covered by trees.

Wooden fences were surrounding the entrance, and a coarse watchtower was placed on the grounds.

Right inside of it, there were huge tents and houses built.

There were a lot of heavy sacks placed below the tents.

When they vaguely guessed the number of wagons, adding the ones they couldn’t see, it amounted to at least 1,000.

‘There’s some left over even after providing for two corps.’

A smile appeared on Aaron’s mouth.

Then, Richard pointed the pile of sacks.

“Those are the provisions of Istel kingdom.”

Mendel, who was next to them, mumbled with a surprised expression.

“Even so, I didn’t know at all that there was a place like this.”

At those words, Roan, Aaron and Richard who were next to him, nodded.

‘It’s a place I hadn’t expected at all. It’s the best place to save provisions without getting caught. But……..’

It certainly was one of the best places because of the many advantages it had.

But storage facility only had one entrance, and the wide road that followed below the mountain was suitable for an army to cross on it.

And there was one bigger problem.

‘It’s too far with the front line.’

Istel kingdom had advanced quite a ways into the west.

‘Although it’s to protect the provisions safely……..’

There was nothing good in making the supply line longer.

Roan glared at the entrance.

At that instant, the entrance was zoomed in on.

He was looking at the soldier that protected the entrance.

Traces that wagons had come and go were seen.

There were no weird things going on.

‘Am I worrying too much?’

Then, Aaron’s voice was heard.

“What’s the number of soldiers guarding the supply storage?”

Richard and Mendel looked at the entrance and replied.

“It’s difficult to say the exact number as we can only see the entrance and the fences. But from what we can see, it seems like they are 500.”

Aaron frowned.

“500………”

500 only at the entrance.

When he also guessed from the size of the interior, there may be three or four times more soldiers.

“They are at least 1500-2000.”

At Aaron’s guess, everyone nodded.

2000 enemy soldiers.

On the other hand, Aaron’s force was 4,000.

“You’ve done well, Richard.”

At Aaron’s compliment, Richard brightly smiled and bowed.

“I was just lucky.”

His humbleness was not too excessive.

However, Richard’s merit was quite big.

Also, Istel kingdom had hid themselves because of the repeated blows they had suffered.

They seriously lowered the amount of soldiers protecting the storage even after knowing that the advancing speed of the main troop would lessen.

They used a method to quickly spread small provisions in the middle of the night.

Thanks to that, the 7th corps was taking quite a lot of time to find the supply storage the more time passed.

But Richard, of the special troops, had found the supply facility.

It was a merit that was complementable enough.

Aaron turned to look at the troop commanders and said in a low voice.

“We hit at the fastest speed possible and fall back.”

“Yes. Understood.”

It was impossible to seize that amount of provisions, as it was the enemy’s territory.

Rather, it was more suitable to burn it all and retreat quickly.

Aaron faced everyone and then stood up and shook his right hand.

The flagman who was waiting, shook his flag.

At the same time, the archers fired off arrows.

Sweeeeee!

Thousands of arrows split the air alongside a sharp sound.

Pubububuk!

A rain of arrows poured over the tents and the entrance.

“Kek!”

“Kugh!”

The soldiers who were guarding, became porcupines and fell down.

The 7th corps fired two more rounds of arrows and then charged forward.

“Take over the supply storage!”

“Kill them!”

4,000 soldiers poured out from the forest.

They ran towards the confused soldiers.

“Uo!”

“Kok!”

The soldiers of Istel kingdom couldn’t properly fight back and fell by becoming cold corpses on the ground.

Puuuuu!

The only thing they did was blow a horn trumpet to let their troops know of the infiltration of the enemy.

The battle flowed quite one sidedly however.

“Don’t let even one alive!”

“Don’t let them go!”

The soldiers of the 7th corps charged through the entrance and were able to get into a deep part of the storage with a violent intent.

However, they couldn’t see any more enemies.

Roan, who caught up late, frowned.

‘The number of soldiers protecting it is too low.’

The number they had expected was 2,000.

However, the only ones guarding it were the 500, the ones from the entrance.

The situation in Istel kingdom wasn’t good.

To the point that it was difficult to stay in war for long.

‘But they are maintaining the supply this sloppily?’

There was no way.

‘Something’s not right……’

A feeling that uneasiness took over his heart.

“Roan, why is your expression like that? This battle is also a complete victory, a complete victory.”

Aaron approached while brightly smiling.

Then, one sack moved into Roan’s sight.

‘That!’

This was the reason of the uneasiness.

He hurriedly tore up the sak.

Riip.

What fell outside of the sack were weeds covered in oil.

Roan looked at Aaron and yelled.

“It’s a trap! We have to get out immedi……”

When he talked up to that moment.

Something moved inside his sight.

One arrow that split the blue sky.

Roan concentrated on the tip of the arrow.

Because of Kalian’s tear, every movement in the world became slow.

Sweeeeee!

The arrow flewwhile cutting through the air really slowly.

There was a flame at the tip of the arrow.

Sweeeeeeeeeee!

Below the first arrow, hundreds more could be seen.

Roan’s face stiffened.

He yelled with all his strength.

“Dodge!”

His voice was heard slowly.

The soldiers had confused expressions and looked at the surroundings at Roan’s yell, and then kicked the ground.

Roan also grabbed Aaron’s neck and threw him.

At the same time, the slow world’s movement turned to the original speed.

Pubububuk!

Arrows poured over the heads of the 7th corps.

The tents and the sacks got caught in the arrow rain and caught on fire.

Whooooosh!

An amazing heat flew out.

The fire surged up to the sky and gulped down the sacks.

“Uhh. What is this……..”

Aaron was thrown by Roan.

He couldn’t finish his sentence and shut his mouth.

And it was the same for Roan.

He looked at the path of fire burning fiercely and ground his teeth.

‘For it to be a trap.’

It was the first time since he had returned to the past.

He had achieved consecutive victories because he knew the future until now.

Roan’s eyes sunk calmly.

‘For me to fall in a trap……’

This was really, a really unexpected thing.

*****

“Hahaha!”

A magnanimous laughter rang out.

The one who was looking at the scene while standing at the top was a big builded middle aged man with quite a pretty face.

“We finally caught those rats.”

He looked at the place where his sight reached.

That was none other than the Istel Kingdom Army’s 2nd supply storage which the 7th corps had broken through.

‘As the big and small supply lines got cut off, the front troops fell in chaos.’

It was a troublesome and angering situation for the one in charge of the provisions.

He tried making a separate troop to annihilate the ones attacking the supply lines, but it was fruitless.

‘The scale of the troop was really small, and on top of that, their movements were quite swift.’

But even so, they couldn’t just stand still.

In the end, the middle aged man decided to set up a trap.

And there was even a suitable place.

An empty ground they used as the saving point of supplies at the start of the war.

It was a place they didn’t use anymore because of the advancing speed of the main troop.

They filled the sacks with weeds and oil.

And then set up soldiers and purposely spilled the location of the fake storage.

‘And they took the bait.’

The middle aged man was waiting at the cliff surrounding the storage and fired off arrows the moment the 7th corps broke in.

The fake storage, that was filled with weed and oil, was caught up in an amazing fire.

On top of that, they threw strong trees to block the entrance.

‘Although it’s regrettable that it isn’t rocks……’

It wasn’t easy to find rocks big and strong enough to block the entrance.

Instead, they blocked the entrance with trees and set it on fire.

“The entrance has been blocked!”

“Damn! Look for an escape route!”

“Put out the fire!”

The 7th corps yelled while looking at the spreading fire.

“Hahaha! How good to see!”

The middle aged man saw that and burst out of laughter.

Then, a thick voice was heard.

“Troop commander Martin. Won’t it be better to pour more arrows?”

He had a huge body and a thick lined face.

The left eye that was covered with a clean cloth.

He was Vernon Pollet, who had lost his left eye because of Harrison’s arrow while he was chasing Roan’s back.

The middle aged man, Teise Martin shook his head.

“Even if we don’t do that, we are lacking goods. And that’s the same for the arrows. They will die by getting caught in the fire, so there’s no need to waste any more arrows.”

“Mmm.”

Vernon smacked his lips and stepped down.

‘You have to end it when you can.’

Actually, he didn’t quite like Teise.

If Vernon was a normal military officer, Teise was closer to being a civil officer.

Because of that, he liked to use his head to win battles rather than using force.

He was the polar opposite to Vernon, who liked to charge to the front without looking back.

‘If only it wasn’t for the wound…….’

He wouldn’t have fallen back to the rear like this.

He remembered the greenhorn spearman that made his eye like this.

‘I have to catch that bastard and kill him.’

Ududuk.

The sound of teeth grinding was clearly heard.

Then, a familiar guy was heard among the soldiers of Rinse kingdom.

‘Mmm?’

Vernon frowned and inserted mana in his right eye.

The guy who was leading the soldiers with a really calm attitude.

“That guy?”

Vernon opened his eyes widely.

His face burned in an instant.

“Kuhahahaa!”

The laughter that explodes.

“Wh, why are you suddenly like this?”

Teise shrinked down with a surprised expression.

A sharp and chilly bloodthirst was felt in Vernon’s eye.

“The bastard that made me like this is over there.”

*****

Chaos.

The storage resembled a chaotic place.

Whooooooosh!

The flame gulped down the tents and the sacks.

Below that, the soldiers of the 7th corps had become porcupines.

The red fire gulped down the corpses.

“Get away!”

“Fall back!”

“Don’t push!”

The soldiers stepped back while dodging the fire.

They were pushing their comrades in order to survive.

“U,uak!”

“F,F,fire!”

“Save me!”

The soldiers that couldn’t dodge, got caught up in the fire.

“Uuk.”

The disgusting smell of skin getting burnt spread out.

The roasted skin slowly started to melt.

The burnt corpses increased bit by bit.

‘Damn. There’s no escape.’

Roan ground his teeth.

He searched his back and his sides but there was no escape.

‘And we can’t climb the hill.’

In the end, they had to get out through the entrance they came in.

The problem.

‘That place is blocked by trees.’

On top of that, there was an amazing fire.

“The, there’s no way…….. For, for it to be a trap……..”

Richard, who brought this information, was half absent minded.

And Aaron also didn’t have any solutions.

“Don’t run about in confusion!”

He calmed the soldiers and fell back to a place that still hadn’t caught fire.

“Uooo.”

“Kuhuk.”

Cries filled with pain.

It was the groan of the wounded that couldn’t dodge the fire.

“It’s too hot! Too hot!”

“I, I don’t want to die.”

The ones that received disgusting wounds had their hearts crumble.

“Damn! Move the wounded to the inner part!”

“Take care of them so the wound doesn’t worsen!”

The troop commanders stepped out and commanded the soldiers.

But they were also in a rush.

‘Damn! To get caught in a trap!’

They had lowered their guard at the consecutive victories.

Aaron looked at the huge fire and shook his head.

‘Is this hell…….’

It was even painful to breathe because of the hot heat.

Aaron blamed his impatience.

The supply storage of Istel kingdom.

He had plentily expected the enemy to be prepared.

And because of that, he led half of his force.

However, as it was enemy territory, it was more suitable to attack quickly and retreat.

‘I have to check it more carefully…..’

Strength was put in his hand.

Then, he saw Roan’s back.

He had a kind of pondering look.

‘He’s calm even in this situation.’

He thought that it was really Roan like.

Then, Roan started to move.

And surprisingly enough, the place he was moving to was the burning entrance.

‘I can’t keep hiding my strength in this situation.’

Roan took in a breath.

The lives of the soldiers and his life was in danger.

This wasn’t the moment to be hiding his strength.

‘Let’s do it.’

He became determined.

For him, and for his comrades.

Roan moved towards the entrance.

‘If I pull all of my mana, I might be able to crush the trees.’

You wouldn’t know if it were other people, but if it was Roan, he had plenty of possibilities.

For now, he used Brent’s ring to not feel any heat.

If it was for a short moment, it was possible to approach the fire.

‘On top of that, the mana i’m learning is Flamdor. It was the mana technique of the fire monarch Reid.’

He could say that fire was the source of his strength.

Grip.

Roan gripped his spear tightly.

“Roan!”

“Roan! Where are you going!”

Aaron , Gale, and etc. called out to Roan to stop him.

Roan just turned his head to look at them.

A smile was on his face.

“Don’t be too surprised.”

They were words you couldn’t understand.

Roan started to move again.

An amazing path of fire surged up in his surroundings.

‘Kuk. Even Brent’s ring has a limit.’

It was weak, but he could feel the heat.

‘If I waste more time, my skin will get burnt.’

Brent’s ring only made you not to feel any heat, it didn’t make the energy itself powerless.

If he slipped up, he could get a wound when he wasn’t paying attention.

Then.

Sweeee!

A sharp sound was heard in his ears.

Roan instinctively threw his body even before he saw it.

Puk!

An arrow was stuck in the place where he was standing.

Roan looked at the place where the arrow was fired with a calm expression.

Because of Kalian’s tear, he could see the face of the man on the cliff clearly.

‘He’s the bastard that chased me back then.’

Vernon, who was on the cliff, was pointing his bow towards Roan.

‘I’m sorry, but I have no time to play with you.’

Roan was calm even while looking at the arrow pointing at him.

“Harrison!”

A loud yell.

“Yes!”

Harrison, who was at the back of the soldiers, replied in a loud voice.

Roan made a sign with his left hand and pointed to the hill.

“Ah…..”

Harrison, who followed the cliff with his eyes, let out a low exclamation.

Although he couldn’t see it as clearly as Roan, he recognized Vernon at one glance.

‘That bastard dares to!’

Harrison shut his mouth and grabbed his bow.

He moved between the fire and knocked an arrow.

Jiiiiiiiiiiiing.

The bowstring became tense.

‘Hoo. Hoo. Hup.’

His breath stopped.

At the same time, he let go of the fingers that were pulling the string.

Ting!

A clear sound.

Sweeeeee!

A sharp sound rang out.

One arrow pierced the fire and surged to the skies.

Roan looked at that and moved with a composed expression.

He didn’t look at the arrow anymore.

Because he trusted in Harrison’s ability.

‘Damn!’

Vernon, who was about to fire an arrow at Roan, fortunately didn’t miss Harrison inside the fire. He hurriedly pulled Teise’s arm and got on the floor.

When Vernon lowered half of his body.

Pat!

One arrow grazed his armour.

If he was a bit slower, he would have had his head pierced.

‘Damn! He’s the bastard that fired the arrow last time!’

His face reddened.

They were the bastards that made him have only one eye.

Those bastards were inside the fire.

‘I have to kill them with my own hands.’

Vernon stepped back.

“Where are you going?”

Teise frowned.

Vernon replied shortly after turning back.

“Even in this situation, I will have to receive indemnization for my eye.”

He started to climb down the hill following the back road.

Meanwhile, Roan stood in front of the trees.

“Whew.”

He let out a long sigh and gripped his spear.

The spear shined by receiving bright light.

‘Hph.’

One thread of mana surged up from his mana hole.

In that instant.

Flaaaaaaaame!

The fire that was burning the trees moved towards Roan.

It was a situation that may eat him at any moment.

“Roan!”

“It’s dangerous!”

Aaron and the soldiers, who were looking, yelled.

However Roan was rather calm.

No, he was actually a bit surprised.

‘This……’

His respiratory tract had heated up.

And it was also the same for his internal organs.

‘Ah……’

Vitality surged up.

Every time he breathed, an amazing amount of fire essence was sucked into his body.

The mana that was just a thread, that was like a raging billow, stirred in his body.

An amazing amount of strength was sent to the tip of his hands and feet.

‘I can do it.’

It was a strength he hadn’t felt until now.

He gained confidence from this.

He looked at the pile of trees in front of him and lowered his stance.

The spear was gripped with both of his hands.

Mana spouted out through his two palms.

Spat.

The colour of Roan’s mana was usually close to a transparent white light.

But it was different now.

This time, it had a red color.

Although it was difficult to recognize as it was dim, a red color was certainly seen in the blade of the spear.

Roan stepped up with his left leg and twisted both of his wrists.

Pat!

The spear split the air and crossed over the fire.

‘Kuk!’

An amazing heat was felt.

However Roan didn’t stop.

He executed the Flamdor mana technique and put strength into his spear.

Finally, the spear landed on the tree.

Baaaaaaang!

An amazing explosion rang out everywhere.

At the same time, the flames that were surging up to the skies, covered Roan.

“No!!!”

“Roan!!!”

A sound close to a scream came out.

The screams of Aaron, Gale and the soldiers rang throughout the empty lot.

‘I’m dead.’

When the pile of fire poured over his head.

He instinctively thought that.

‘Can I absorb the essence of fire with the Flamdor mana technique?’

Roan thought that in that short moment.

Whooosh.

The fire was now close to touching his skin.

At that moment.

Something that was spinning in his mana, flinched as if it was blocked and then returned to the mana hole.

‘What is………..’

He was planning to try to control the fire by executing the Flamdor mana technique.

However, his mana technique didn’t listen to him at all.

‘Am I really going to die?’

The hair on his head rose up.

Then.

An amazing chill gathered on a side of his chest.

‘Kuk!’

The chill stirred up his body like mana and then exploded near his mana hole.

The chill that was emanated from his whole body clashed against the fire.

Poong!

A sound rang out so loud, it made your ears numb.

At the same time, the fire that was about to gulp him down at any moment, bounced back to the opposite side.

Even the trees couldn’t endure the amazing shock and crumbled.

‘Kugh.’

In an instant, the chill disappeared as if he had washed it off.

Just like it was something that didn’t exist in the first place.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and operated the Flamdor mana technique.

Fortunately, the mana moved as he wished.

‘What was that just now?’

Even if he searched in every nook and cranny of his body, he couldn’t find the chill from before.

He wanted to sit down immediately and search the cause of that chill, but he didn’t have the leisure to do so right now.

‘I have to get out of here for now.’

Roan took in a breath and looked at the entrance.

He looked at the trees that turned to ashes.

The half crumbled trees, couldn’t endure the flames.

Although there were still some flames around, he had still secured a path to escape.

He carefully checked the far away mountain road with Kalian’s tear.

‘We just have to reach the mountain slope.’

It was a distance the archers on the cliffs may not even reach.

No, precisely speaking, they couldn’t fire because of the dense forest.

‘There we go, we charge through.’

Because of the dense forest, it would be difficult to chase them.

Roan, who organized his thoughts, looked back to the soldiers of the 7th corps.

Round eyes, slightly opened mouth were the expressions all around.

Aaron, Mendel, Richard, Gale, and everyone else all had the same expressions.

They were looking at Roan with absent minded expressions.

“Ho,ho, how……..?”

Even so, Aaron who got a hold of himself the first, fumbled and mumbled.

Roan slightly shook his head and pointed the entrance.

“We have to get out of here. Now!”

These were the words he shouted out loudly for them to wake up.

“Ah! Ri… right!”

Only then did Aaron turn to look at the corps and yell.

“Retreat! Retreat! Everyone get out!”

The soldiers got a hold of themselves late.

“Re, Retreat! Retreat!”

They were still confused.

They yelled retreat and started to run while taking care of the wounded.

“Th, thank you!”

“Truly thank you!”

While getting out of the entrance, the soldiers bowed and showed gratitude.

Roan faintly smiled and then looked at the cliff.

He saw Teise’s restless expression.

He was also absent minded at Roan’s performance.

However he couldn’t keep being like that forever.

“Fi, fire arrows! Pour arrows over them!”

This wasn’t the time to worry about the lacking goods.

Archers appeared over the cliff.

Sweeeeee!

It was a sharp sound.

Thousands of arrows split the wind.

“Rose troop!”

Roan yelled with all his strength and sent a sign.

The infantry receiving Roan’s command that was at the rear, gathered together and raised up the wooden shields.

Pubububuk!

Arrow rain poured over them.

Roan sent another sign.

“Take a shield formation!”

“Don’t split apart!”

At the orders of each troop commanders, they moved with each other and moved.

They guarded the soldiers of the 7th corps with the shields that were over their head.

‘They do strange training everyday.’

‘Their movement are well ordered.’

The infantry could become valiant soldiers in a short amount time because of Roan’s training.

However, it was impossible to protect all of the soldiers of the 7th corps.

Pubububuk!

“Uak!”

“Kok!”

The soldiers became porcupines.

‘Damn!’

Roan ground his teeth and moved.

He twisted his wrist while holding his spear.

Hoong. Hoong. Hoong.

The spear quickly turned along with a heavy sound.

At the same time, Roan operated the Flamdor mana technique.

In an instant, the fire started to get sucked in the spear.

Flaaaame!

The red flame followed the spin of the spear and continued.

Pubububuk!

Some of the thousands of arrows got blocked in the path of fire and burned up.

“Ah…..”

The soldiers that had already gotten out of the entrance, became absent minded one more time at Roan’s performance.

The fire that spun alongside the spinning spear, as if it was covering it.

This was just like looking at a god of fire, at a fire king.

“Fire even more! More! Shoot everything you have!”

Teise turned crazy and yelled.

Thanks to that, he was standing at the peak of the hill.

Harrison walked to the front as if he was waiting for it.

A hail of arrows shot out from the cliff.

But even so, he didn’t show any movements.

‘Eat this!’

The moment he was about to let go of the bowstring.

One arrow that was fired by the soldiers of Istel, grazed by Harrison’s arm.

“Kuk!”

A really small movement was made as a result.

Tung!

The bowstring was knocked at the same time.

The arrow split the air and flew out.

“Fire! Fire! Fire more……”

Teise’s madness couldn’t continue.

Puk!

Harrison’s arrow was stuck in his arm.

“Uaaaak!”

Teise frowned at the sickening pain and threw a tantrum.

“Tro, troop commander!”

The surrounding soldiers approached with urgent expressions.

The top of the hill became frenetic.

Because of that, the rain of arrows halted for a moment.

“Harrison!”

At Roan’s yell, Harrison brightly smiled back and then stepped back.

All the soldiers got out of the fake storage with him as the last ones.

Boom. Boom.

The tents and fences collapsed.

And the trees inside the fake storage also couldn’t endure it anymore.

The fire gulped down everything.

The lot without people resembled a fuel hole.

“Roan! Everyone got out!”

Aaron’s voice was heard outside the entrance.

Roan swung his spear to shake off the fire and moved out of the empty ground.

He felt a strong heat at his back.

Meanwhile, the fire became even more fierce.

If he was even a bit late, the entire 7th corps would have been eaten by the fire.

‘But it’s still too early to relax.’

Although they had gotten out, the situation still wasn’t good.

‘Soon, Istel kingdom will climb down the cliff.’

They would have a capable leader aside from Teise.

‘We have to move as fast as possible.’

There was a place in the mountain slope he had seen with Kalian’s tear.

“Corps commander! We have to move quickly towards the slope!”

Aaron realized in an instant where Roan was talking about.

Although he had made a mistake this time, he was a soldier that had experience in battles.

“I will take care of the back.”

Aaron hesitated at those words for a moment and then nodded.

“Please.”

It was a short but hot word.

Aaron ran to the front while passing by the soldiers.

The soldiers received Aaron’s command and quickly retreated.

“Rose troop’s infantry will take care of the rear!”

Gale and Aaron had moved to the front together.

Actually, Roan was the one leading rose troop.

“Yes! Understood!”

The soldiers of rose troop replied in a loud voice and stood shoulder by shoulder.

The strong shields moved with each other without leaving a space.

Pububuk!

The arrows flowing from the hill were stuck over it.

“Take formations!”

Austin’s voice was heard.

The soldiers of rose troop protected the others and started to fall back little by little.

Roan moved one step ahead of them and acted as a scout.

Then.

“You bastards!”

A voice rang out that was like thunder.

A man with a big body and thick face appeared.

A man that covered his left eye with a clean cloth was Vernon.

He was in an excited state.

“Block them!”

Even before Roan stepped to the front, Austin’s order was sent.

Over the shields, long spears surged up.

A look that reminded you of a porcupine.

“Hmph! Ridiculous things!”

Vernon pulled up mana and charged the ground.

The long sword split the air with a scary intent.

Bang!

The shields and the sword clashed and a sound exploded.

The shield was split in half.

“KuoK!”

“Kugh!”

The soldiers trembled as if they would collapse by the shock transmitted in their palms.

The strong formation crumbled.

“Maintain! Maintain!”

Austin yelled with strength.

Soldiers walked to the front to replace the crumbled place.

‘Look at them.’

Vernon frowned at that quick movement.

This kind of movement was only possible in the central army of Istel kingdom.

‘Even so, they are merely normal soldiers!’

He swung his sword once again.

At that moment, tens of spears split the air and stabbed in.

An attack without flaws from head to toe.

But even so, Vernon didn’t get perplexed.

He turned his sword and knocked away the spears.

Cheng! Chechecheng!

Sparks appeared along the sound of metal.

“Kuk!”

The soldiers lost balance again at the spear that were knocked back too easily.

Their palms felt numb.

Because of the spears that were knocked to the side, the strong shield formation crumbled.

And this time also, Vernon didn’t miss the opportunity.

“Die!”

He swung his blade after getting inside the formation.

Terrible explosive sounds were heard continuously.

The soldiers tried to rise their spears by standing shoulder to shoulder, but it was useless.

Vernon resembled a savage beast.

“Die! Die! You son of a bitches! I’m from Istel’s kin………”

The yell got cut off.

It was because of the spear that came in attacking his head.

“Hph!”

It was completely different to the attacks of a normal soldier.

The speed behind the spear, the strength, and the angle; it was all different.

Everything was strong, quick and concise.

Vernon hurriedly shook his head and charged the ground.

However, the spear continued following him just like the head of a snake.

‘Damn!’

Vernon ground his teeth and swung his sword.

The spear got knocked aside along with the sound of metal clashing.

Because he swung his sword in an unstable stance, the joints in his shoulders and elbow became numb.

‘Just what bastard dares to!’

Vernon glared at the owner of the spear that bothered him.

At that instant, the remaining right eye became big.

“This bastard. I finally met you.”

His eye boiled with rage.

Vernon was glaring at the owner of the spear, Roan. .

Roan, who was patrolling at the front, returned at Vernon’s appearance.

‘Normal soldiers can’t face a knight utilizing mana.’

If he just let him be, his losses would become too severe.

Roan sent a sign towards Austin.

‘Retreat.’

Austin, who was making the shield formation again, understood the order and sent the same sign towards the soldiers.

The disarmed shields moved together once again.

Step. Step.

It was a well ordered retreat.

But Vernon didn’t think of following them back.

His objective was Roan anyways.

Vernon smiled fishily and showed his yellow teeth.

“I will chew up your flesh piece by peice you bas……”

“Your tongue is long.”

Roan cut his words and attacked him.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Attack and defense followed and the sound of metal was heard.

Sparks appeared.

“It seems like you picked up the mana technique somewhere, but the level is really poor!”

Vernon teased and pulled up mana.

‘Kugh.’

In that instant, the strength behind the sword changed.

Just like he had said, compared to Vernon’s mana, the level of Roan’s mana was still lacking.

It clearly showed that the time he had trained was short when he battled a knight 1vs1.

‘If I just had that great strength from back then…..’

No, if he just had fire in his surroundings, the situation could have been better.

Pabat! Pat! Cheng! Checheng!

Vernon’s sword split the air and pushed Roan into a corner.

Shallow wounds of the sword appeared as he got cut on his wrist or thighs.

‘Kugh.’

Roan executed his spearmanship and real battle techniques, but the level of mana proficiency was too different.

Every time he blocked an attack, he felt a pain that would rip his palms apart.

“Now, give me your eyes!”

Vernon pulled more mana and swung his blade.

Roan, stepped in closer and raised his spear up high.

Cheng!

His spear and the sword clashed.

‘Kugh.’

An amazing strength was felt in his palm.

Gkkkk.

The sword was digging into the spear.

‘I’m dying like this.’

Right before his body and his spear was about to get split in half.

Brent’s ring moved into his sight.

‘Ah!’

Roan had forgotten it as he only concentrated on the spear, using only Reid’s battle techniques and the Flamdor mana technique, but there were many spells in Brent’s ring.

‘I just have one opportunity.’

Roan inserted mana into his ring.

Light shone from his ring.

“Die!”

Vernon, fortunately didn’t seem to realize it, and was still pressing down with his sword.

Roan looked at Vernon’s eyes fixedly.

At the same time, his mouth lightly moved.

“Light.”

At that moment.

Paat!

A marble of light appeared in front of Vernon’s right eye.

It was a small but very bright marble of light.

“Kugh!”

Vernon unconsciously shut his right eye and shook his head.

He lost his balance in an instant.

Roan twisted his body as if he was waiting for it, and after he knocked the sword away he swung his spear.

Pushuk!

The spear stabbed deeply into Vernon’s side.

“Kuk!”

Vernon staggered while still having his eyes closed.

Roan pulled out the spear and then twisted his wrist.

The spear split the air and flew towards Vernon’s neck.

“I will pay your eye later on.”

A cold voice came out.

At the same time, the sharp spear cut off Vernon’s neck.

At that moment, an amazing amount of blood flowed out.

Slash. Tuk.

The head rolled on the floor.

He still had his right eye closed.

The body that had lost it’s head staggered for a moment and then fell over.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a long sigh and roughly cleaned off the blood on his face and body.

‘My mana is all spent.’

Even so, it was the mana that was almost dry.

The moment he executed a skill with Brent’s ring, it ended up finishing up.

‘The efficiency is too bad.’

It wasn’t an item he could use as he wished until after the level of his mana rose to some degree.

Roan shook his head and checked his surroundings.

The front of the 7th corps entered midway into the slope.

“Retreat! We are passing through the forest on the right!”

Aaron certainly had good eyes in grasping the situation of the battle.

He also thought of retreating into the forest instead of the mountains, just like Roan.

The soldiers of the 7th corps moved into the forest one by one.

And the infantry that was in charge of the rear also arrived at the destination.

Roan hurriedly chased their back.

‘It’s time for the enemy to climb down.’

His steps became quicker.

Then.

Puuuuuuu!

The sound of the horn trumpet was spread through the forest.

At the same time, dust clouds arose below the cliff.

He couldn’t see Teise, but the commanders that were at least adjutants were leading the soldiers.

Roan yelled towards Austin.

“Retreat! Get inside the forest!”

Austin realized that returning back was strange, and he quickly made the soldiers of rose troop enter the forest.

‘If their force is only that small, we can easily block them in the forest.’

It obviously wouldn’t be easy.

‘The losses will be enormous.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

he roamed the battlefield for 20 long years.

He knew how gruesome and miserable it was taking care of the rearguard.

‘It seems like today will be really long.’

The day of bloody color had just started.

Chapter 73




Sponsored chapter

The ones chasing and the ones chased.

The chase of Istel kingdom continued persistently.

As the retreating route was inside Istel kingdom’s territory, the pursuers increased as more time passed.

The 7th corps broke through Istel kingdom line that came running from the sides and the front and moved towards the west.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

The soldiers were clearly exhausted.

Their armor was covered in blood.

The soldiers that amounted to 4,000 were now 2,000.

Already, half of the soldiers have left the world.

“A little bit more.”

Aaron encouraged the soldiers.

He also was in a situation where he could also collapse at any moment, but he ground his teeth and endured.

He moved faster than anyone and at everyone’s front.

Step. Step.

When the back of his foot swept the ground, white dust rose up.

When he moved three or four more steps.

Puuuuuu.

The sound of a horn trumpet was heard.

It was the sound they had heard the past few days that made them feel the creeps.

The faces of Aaron and the soldiers turned pale.

“Is it the end……”

In the end, a half giving up sound was also heard from Aaron’s mouth.

Roan, who was leading the infantry of rose troop at the back, stood to the front.

“We will stop them.”

He spoke in a daring and composed voice.

Roan also had an exhausted look but his situation was better than the other commanders.

And that was also the same for the infantry of rose troop.

They, who had trained with the latest training methods of 20 years from now on, had more stamina than the other soldiers.

On top of that, because of the repeated troop strategy training, the waste of their energy was low.

Roan stood at the front and gripped his spear.

‘There’s not much until we leave the territory.’

If they won this skirmish, they’d be able to get into friendly territory.

‘Let’s endure it one more time.’

Roan bit his lower lip.

His sight moved over the hill.

Puuuu.

The sound of horn trumpet rang in his ear.

Dudududu.

Followed by that, horse clops were heard.

Flock!

At the same time, a sharp flag appeared over the hill.

“Ah……”

At that moment, a low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

The magnificent troop flag waved in the wind, which the cavalrymen at the front were holding.

That flag was familiar for his eyes.

Roan turned to look at Aaron and yelled.

“They aren’t of the Istel kingdom. They’re friendlies!”

In that instant, the faces of Aaron and the soldiers turned to become that of relief and surprise.

Roan’s voice was heard.

“It’s Count Lancephil!”

*****

It was fate that he met Lancephil’s army.

The army was patrolling the eastern region and annihilating Istel kingdom’s army.

Meanwhile, they had met with the 7th corps.

“Baron Tate. You’ve done well.”

“No, Count Lancephil. We could keep our lives because of you.”

Aaron bowed.

Io looked at that and smiled.

‘I thought that the movements of the enemy had become more hesitant, but it was that the 7th corps were attacking the supply lines.’

They were rendering such great merits they couldn’t even think of.

Io was astounded.

His sight naturally moved over to the one next to him.

‘Roan.’

Roan was standing next to Aaron.

A vice troop commander was next to him instead of the other troop commanders.

And that was because of Aaron’s consideration and Io’s petition.

Following Aaron’s report, most of the merits they have rendered was because of Roan.

‘Even at this retreat, they were in charge of the rear and rendered a distinguished merit.’

It was a merit that became more surprising the more you heard of it.

Only that not him, nor anyone of Lancephil’s territory knew that he was learning mana.

And that was because of Aaron’s consideration.

He thought that it may somehow affect Roan and sent the order of never revealing it outside before Roan revealed it himself.

And the soldiers of the 7th corps, who could keep their lives because of Roan, kept that promise thoroughly.

“For now, rest for a couple days.”

“Thank you.”

At Io’s words, Aaron bowed once again.

And Roan also did the same.

Below their heads, a sigh of relief flowed out.

Although they had lost half of their forces, thinking about it differently, they had rescued half of their forces.

‘Although we suffered a big blow because we fell into their trap……..’

They couldn’t stop like this.

‘In war, it’s normal for there to be mistakes and defeat.’

One couldn’t always win a perfect victory.

‘It’s enough if you learn from the mistakes and defeats.’

Looking at it from another point of view, there was also a part where he unconsciously became careless just because he returned to the past.

‘In the past, in the present, and in the future, war is still war.’

It was normal that lives were lost.

He always had to think and act prudently.

It was the first time Roan experienced a bad thing since he returned to the past.

‘In the first place, I’m not a strategist.’

In his past life he was merely a spearmen squad commander.’

Roan clenched his fists.

‘Istel bastards. Although you would be laughing right now……’

Fire appeared in his eyes.

‘I will make you shed tears of blood next time.’

He returned as much as he received.

No, he would certainly return it with interest.

That was the rule of a war.

After Io left his tent, he went to the camp of the 7th corps that was located at the rear.

After he crossed over two entrances and was about to enter the camp.

Aaron, who was walking in front of him, abruptly stopped.

“Mmm.”

A low exclamation flowed out of him.

Roan stayed close and looked in front.

‘Ah……’

He barely gulped down the exclamation that was about to come out.

He looked at the ground in front of him.

Troop commander Richard of the special troops and his soldiers were over there.

They had tied their bodies with a tight rope and were kneeling.

It was the look of sinners.

They discovered Aaron and then bowed towards the ground.

Aaron moved and stood in front of Richard.

Soldiers of other troops gathered over to the surroundings.

“Richard. What are you doing?”

At Aaron’s words, Richard replied while not being able to raise his head.

“Because of me, more than 2,000 soldiers had died.”

He replied in a serious voice.

His shoulders trembled.

“Cut off my head. Only, save my underlings as they solely acted at my orders.”

“Richard…….”

Aaron bit his lower lip.

If there was a merit reward, there would also be a punishment for when you made a mistake.

Especially in this case, you had to punish Richard who had the most responsibility in a public showing.

“Whew.”

A long sigh flowed from Aaron’s mouth.

Then Roan, who was looking at the situation from the back, kneeled down between Aaron and Richard.

“The one that proposed to attack the enemy’s supply line and storage in their territory was me. The cause of all this was me. Rather, punish me and save troop commander Richard’s life.”

They had lost more than 2,000 lives.

In this situation, they couldn’t kill the best troop in the 7th corps.

On top of that, although Richard had made a mistake in this battle, the merits he had accumulated couldn’t be seen lightly.

If you slew a commander for only one mistake, who would stand at the front and face the enemies?

Roan bowed towards the ground.

Then, a loud voice was heard.

“If that’s the case, it’s also difficult for me not to receive the punishment.”

The owner of the voice was Gale.

He passed over the soldiers and kneeled down next to Roan.

“It’s also a big sin not having taken care of troop commander well.”

Kennis and the adjutants of rose troop, followed his back.

“We will also receive the punishment.”

The soldiers of rose troop that were looking, kneeled down next to the special troop’s soldiers.

“We will also receive it.”

“We didn’t fare that much better.”



These were the 2,000 soldiers that had survived.

They struggled desperately and became more persistent and firm.

Soon, all the adjutants and soldiers kneeled down.

The only person standing in the camp was Aaron.

He looked at the soldiers of the 7th corps and slowly kneeled down.

“I also became careless and made a mistake, so I must also receive a punishment.”

Aaron bowed.

At that look, Richard and the troop commanders yelled in one voice.

“Corps commander!”

A strong heat flowed out from them.

Aaron raised his head once again and looked at everyone.

“We all made a big mistake. And because of that, many of our allies have died.”

There was a strong resonance in his voice.

“We will fight by carrying the names of the friends that left first.”

He stood up and unsheathed his sword.

A sharp sound hit their ears.

Slash!

Aaron sliced the tight rope that was tying Richard.

“This isn’t the place for us to die.”

He raised up the soldiers and yelled.

“We are dying on the battlefield! Raise some merits and be exempt from the punishment!”

His voice became louder.

“Let’s tribute the heads of the enemies to the ones that left ahead of us!”

Roan and the other soldiers stood up.

Chuk!

They saluted.

“Sir!”



They lost half of their force.

But they wouldn’t forget.

They would carry the names of their comrades and fight.

It’s not like they would be fighting alone.

The 7th corps was reborn.

No, it evolved.

******

Rarely enough, there were priests in the camp of Count Lancephil.

The injured ones of the 7th corps could receive treatment from the priests because of Io’s consideration.

The other troops of the 7th corps heard the news that they fell into the ambush of the fake storage and started to regroup one by one.

Because of that, the number increased to 6,000 again, and the morale became so high it was about to sunder the sky.

Aaron collected the troops that were annihilated or suffered losses and reorganized them.

As this was the middle of a war, they put aside the formal promotions for later on but Roan was treated as troop commander.

They gathered the Rose Troop’s infantry that originally received strategy training and some cavalrymen from other troops and created the 2nd Rose Troop.

Because Gale’s role went up to Aaron’s adjutant, the original Rose Troop and the 2nd Rose Troop practically came under Roan’s command.

“When the war ends, I will formally give you a troop.”

After that, some more good news was heard.

And one of them was that the capital of Miller dispatched the elite troops that amounted more than 50,000 to face the Byron kingdom.

On top of that, as they had joined hands with the Dies kingdom, the 40,000 soldiers that were in the south were moving towards the east to help them.

Because Roan knew the future, the army of the central and southern region could depart before they got their eastern region taken.

The situation was becoming better as time passed.

Aaron and the commanders of the 7th corps didn’t pass the day negligently.

They gathered in the tent of the corps commander everyday and reviewed the battle of the fake storage.

Richard, the troop commanders that got attacked, and the ones that weren’t with them were carefully reviewing to see what went wrong that time.

“Now that I see it, the movement of the wagons were certainly strange.”

“On top of that, even if we were in a hurry, we had to first grasp the number of the soldiers in the storage.”

“Rather than going inside, it would have been better to fire arrows and set it on fire.”

Several opinions came and went.

Now the troop commander, no, Roan was being treated as the most senior among troop commanders because of the merits he had accumulated until now, organized the contents and was filling in the lacking points.

‘I can’t make the same mistake.’

Roan’s strongest point and virtue was his endless effort.

He recognized the points he lacked in and knew how to fill them.

Then, the doors opened up and one soldier showed up.

“Corps commander. Count Lancephil is looking for you. He says that troop commander also has to assist.”

“Understood.”

Aaron wasn’t perplexed at the sudden meeting.

‘Even so, I wanted to go and find him once……..’

He had rested plentily.

And had reviewed his mistakes enough.

Now was the time to move.

Aaron and Roan went to Io’s tent.

Excluding Io, you could see Kali Owells, the leader of the mages Tairon Bess, Perry Wison who was the leader of the territory’s army, and other important people.

Their expressions were kind of flushed.

“Corps commander Tate. Come sit over here.”

Io brightly smiled and sat in the empty seat.

He also had a flustered face.

Aaron slightly tilted his head.

On the other side, Roan’s interest was in a weird place.

He looked at the youth standing alone at the other side of the table.

The youth that seemed to have three or four years over than him seemed quite familiar.

‘Who was he?’

He had a tickling feeling that he was on the tip of his tongue.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“The name of that youth is Oren. He’s someone sent from the Phillip’s family.”

At that moment, Roan opened his eyes roundly.

‘Oren Part……’

His tickling feeling was refreshed. .

The moment he heard the name, he could remember.

‘The vice director of the agency.’

One of the existences that helped Chris lead the agency was Oren.

If Chris was Ian’s right hand, then Oren was Chris’s right hand.

Oren bowed deeply and said in a composed voice.

“Hello. I’m called Oren and i’m serving Sir Ian Phillips. I’m the one responsible for the information agency Sir Phillip’s has established in his plans.”

“If it’s Ian Phillips, he’s an existence shaking the kingdom nowadays.”

Io nodded with a gratified expression.

Oren continued speaking.

“I received Sir Phillip’s order and focused on grasping the movements of Istel kingdom in the eastern region through the agents. And we finally succeeded in obtaining the information you wanted.”

Io continued saying.

He looked at Aaron and Roan and said.

“They have found the location of the supply storage of Istel kingdom.”

“Ah……”

Aaron let out a low exclamation.

And that was the same for Roan.

But the meaning of the impression was different.

Different from Aaron, who was surprised at the fact that they had found the supply storage, Roan was more impressed at the truth that Ian Phillips made an information agency and operated it more quickly than what he had thought.

‘On top of that, to have already have found Oren……..’

In his past life Chris discovered Oren while he was gathering information and chose him as his right hand man.

It was a famous thing that in that process, Chris found Oren more than 10 times enough to have convinced him.

That was the start of the agency.

‘How did Ian meet Oren and find him? Would he have convinced him more than ten times like Chris?’

He had many questions.

No, he was amazed one more time at Ian’s abilities ahead of his questions.

‘To use the information agency running in the capital of Miller and find more information in the territory and faster than us………’

A genius was a genius.

But of course, he would have to check if that information was true or not.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“Originally, it seems like he went to the eastern army first, but it seems like commander Doyle wasn’t that interested.”

He just said that he wasn’t interested, but it actually meant that he was ignorant.

If it wasn’t for the name of Count Phillips, he wouldn’t even have been able to meet him.

As Io gave the signal, Oren took out two pieces of paper from his chest and gave it to Aaron and Roan.

Quite a well drawn could be seen with a some information.

“In the case of the 7th corps, as they went through the fake storage, I wondered if you would act together with us.”

“Hhm.”

At those words, the head of the knights, Kali Owells, showed a blatantly displeased look.

And Io also knew that, but he just feigned ignorance.

He couldn’t refute his retainer in a place like this.

“Will we be able to do so?”

Aaron asked.

Io faintly smiled and shook his head.

“In the first place, it was the 7th corps that had attacked the supply lines and was cutting it off. If we see it in another way, it’s just like snatching away the merits of the 7th corps.”

At those words, Aaron looked at Roan.

Roan was still checking the contents on the paper.

‘It’s information that’s organized really well.’

He thought that it certainly was Ian.

‘However, this could also be another trap of the enemy.’

He felt Aaron’s gaze late and slightly shook his head.

Aaron realized Roan’s meaning in an instant.

They had clearly grasped their mistakes while reviewing the attack that they had suffered last time in the fake storage.

Whether this information was true or not, they couldn’t just bite it.

“For now, we will have to investigate thoroughly if this information is true or not.”

“Right. As there’s also what happened last time……..”

Io nodded.

He looked at Aaron’s eyes fixedly and said.

“Will the 7th corps take care of that?”

At those words Aaron wasn’t modest anymore.

“If you give us the opportunity, we would like to.”

The decision was set.

He grabbed the opportunity to take revenge on the Istel bastards.

He wanted the 7th corps to start that.

Io brightly smiled and nodded.

“Good. I’ll believe in you and entrust it to you.”

“Thank you.”

Aaron replied shortly afterwards and stood up.

Although he felt Kali’s hot gaze, he forcefully ignored it.

“Then. We will leave.”

Aaron and Roan bowed towards Io and then got out of the tent.

The moment they did, that stuffy feeling cleared up in a moment.

The steps returning to their camp was light.

“For now, we’ll have to gather the troop commanders.”

At Aaron’s words, Roan nodded.

“I will send the gathering order.”

“I’ll be troubling you.”

Aaron hit Roan’s back once and then returned to his own tent.

Roan moved inside the camp to gather the troop commanders.

Then, a familiar faced man approached quickly.

‘Pens?’

He was the one responsible for the information troop Roan created and was a staff member of Chris’s agency.

He ran with a really excited expression.

“You seem really bright.”

At Roan’s words, Pens nodded and took out a piece of paper in his chest.

“We finally found the location of the storage supply.”

“Ah…….”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

He received the paper Pens was giving him.

‘Chris’s agency doesn’t fall back at all.’

He had a proud and satisfied feeling.

A smile appeared on his mouth.

But the moment he checked the contents of the paper, his smile completely disappeared.

He had a stiff face.

Perplexed eyes.

Roan took in a deep breath and ground his teeth.

‘The location is different.’

Chapter 74




Aaron and Roan went to Io’s tent along with Pens.

“Mmm.”

Io looked at Pens’s report and fell into his thoughts.

Pens and Oren.

Even if the locations were different, it was just too different.

On top of that, they were sure that it was the top option and not the 2nd or 3rd in reserve.

There was a high possibility for one of these to be the enemy’s trap.

No, perhaps both of them could be it.

Then, Oren mumbled with a blunt voice.

“Our organization is made up through the support of the Phillip’s family and has steadily expanded its force. There are more than 300 active members. It’s a tolerably small squad.”

His eyes moved to Pens.

“We started gathering and analyzing information in the eastern region the moment war started. There are high possibilities for the storage we found, to be the real one.”

Pens didn’t show any reaction.

‘We gathered and analyzed information even before war started.’



He wanted to say that but he couldn’t.

It was better to hide Chris’s agency the more they could and not expose it, while thinking of the future.

But Aaron wasn’t planning to just endure it and let it pass.

“It seems like this young friend is ignoring our information squad.”

He continued saying with quite a displeased voice and expression.

“Just looking at the staff number, our side certainly has less. However, he had already found several supply lines of Istel kingdom. On top of that, we grasped their surprise attack beforehand and annihilated them by counterattacking. It’s a squad that already has its history.”

At those words, Oren shut his mouth.

Even if he was receiving the support of the Phillip’s family, he was still a commoner.

He couldn’t say anything back at Aaron yet.

Only, there was a displeasing look in his eyes and pride about his organization mixed in it.

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“Anyways, we are in a situation that we have to check the two places.”

At those words everyone nodded.

Roan looked at Oren and continued saying.

“We decided to check if the information you brought us was true or not, so how about you go check if our information is real or not?”

“We?”

Oren had a confused expression at the unexpected proposal.

Io, who was listening, hit his knees.

“That would be good.”

If the concerned parties checked it themselves, they would be convinced more easily.

Aaron and Oren, who pondered for a moment, nodded at the same time.

“Certainly, if we check it with our own eyes, there wouldn’t be useless trouble.”

There wouldn’t be saying such as stealing away the merits, or upturning the truth.

They had to block fighting between themselves in front of a big battle.

“Then. Go and check the truth with your own eyes.”

These were Io’s order.

Aaron, Roan, Oren and Pens bowed at the same time.

“Yes. We understand.”

It was a short reply, but with strength.

The four people were composed and confident, just like one person.

Roan left Io’s tent and grabbed Pens’ shoulders.

“Mister Pens.”

Pens slightly turned his head and looked at Roan.

Roan looked at Pens’ eyes fixedly and continued saying.

“I believe in the information you, Chris’s agency, and the information squad has brought me.”

“Ah……”

Pens let out a low exclamation.

Roan looked at him and smiled faintly.

“Let’s show everyone which information agency is the real one and the best.”

He was confident.

But it wasn’t because he remembered things related to the storage.

When he first came running to him bringing the paper with the location written in it.

The expression from back then.

‘An expression filled with confidence.’

Pens was overly careful and meticulous.

Because of that, his words and actions were heavy, and the expression of his face was consistent.

But that him was smiling brightly.

‘If I don’t believe in my people, who will?’

Roan trusted Pens.

The Pens that smiled more brightly than anyone.

*****

The next day, the small scaled squad left Lancephil’s territory.

As they had the role of just checking the location of the storage, the number of the soldiers was quite low.

As they picked the nimblest soldiers and the ones with the best stamina among the 12 squads, that number amounted only to 40.

And the one leading them was none other than Roan.

He was sent off by Aaron and moved towards Istel kingdom.

Roan divided the 40 people again in groups of 5 and only moved when the sun had set or at dawn.

The reason he split the already small squad.

It wasn’t only to dodge the eyes of the enemy.

‘If the location of the storage is true, we have to secure a road to approach them secretly while evading their eyes.

Roan wasn’t thinking of only checking the location and returning.

He was thinking beyond that.

Because of that, the movement speed was really slow.

However, Roan didn’t rush and that was the same for the soldiers.

They obeyed Roan’s orders.

And after nine days passed like that, they could arrive at the storage located in a deep place in the enemy territory.

It was a storage located between mountains.

‘They are located in a normal location.’

It wasn’t that far from the front lines and was a comfortable location to come and go.

On top of that, the main road was well extended from east to west.

It was the optimal place to store their supplies.

On top of that, different from the last time, there were quite a lot of guards in it.

It had an amazing number of tents, sacks, and soldiers.

‘Is this the real location?’

Roan sent the soldiers to the sides of the hill for now and ordered them to check the storage thoroughly.

At the same time, he climbed to the peak of the mountain.

‘Fortunately, there’s nothing covering my sight.’

As he climbed to the peak of the mountain, he could see the entire storage in his eyes.

If you were a normal person, you’d only be able to see its shape.

But Roan was different.

He had Kalian’s tear with him.

‘It’s quite a solid camp.’

Roan concentrated his sight on several places of the storage.

And every time he did so, the place he looked at seemed as big as if it was in front of him.

Quite some time passed by.

But he didn’t discover anything wrong.

‘The abilities of the organization are quite gre…….’

When he thought up to that point, one scene caught his eye.

A middle aged soldier, who was circling the surroundings as if he was patrolling, approached a young soldier.

At first glance, it was a really natural scene.

However, the problem was the thing the young soldier was holding.

‘Report?’

It was a pile of documents made with mixed old paper and rough leather.

It obviously was a report.

Although he couldn’t see the exact contents, what was filling the side were letters.

‘A normal soldier can read?’

When Roan revealed that he knew how to read and write, Aaron, Gale, Mendel, etc. were really surprised.

That’s how much strange it was for a normal soldier, and a normal soldier at that, that had to battle while putting their life on the line, to know how to read.

The middle aged man swept through the papers for a moment and then, made a handsign towards the soldiers.

The guys that were circling the surroundings started to gather one by one.

And then, they started to read the report in turns.

‘All the soldiers know how to read?’

At this point in time, it was almost impossible for more than tens of soldiers to know how to read.

‘Something’s not right.’

The ones that knew how to read and fight.

At this point in time, only knights knew how to do it.

‘If they really are knights……’

He had a method to check it.

Roan inserted mana into Kalian’s tear.

At that moment, the world was dyed in a golden colour.

“Ah….”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

The golden stream was filling the camp, the mana.

And the mana of that place moved really roughly compared to other places.

On top of that.

‘Mana flows in the bodies of the patrol guards.’

They certainly weren’t normal soldiers.

‘They were the knights of Istel.’

And quite skilled ones on top of that.

Their number surpassed 500.

‘It’s a force that amounts to more than two knight squads.’

Even if the storage was important, there was no reason to dispatch 500 knights at the rear like this.

On top of that, it was even weird for the knights, who had strong pride, to be wearing the armors of normal soldiers.

‘It’s a trap.’

The thought filled his head.

As there were thousands of normal soldiers protecting the outside of the camp, at first glance it seemed a real storage. But there were hidden knights at the center.

‘If it wasn’t for Kalian’s tear, it would have been dangerous.’

A sigh of relief flowed.

‘I’ll have to use Kalian’s tear more earnestly from now on.’

He wasn’t using it much because of the pain it inflicted him until now.

‘But after that day, much of that pain has disappeared.’

The moment he escaped the fake storage.

After the chill exploded out of his body, it became easy for him to handle mana.

It was a feeling that the explosive and rough mana became calm.

And maybe it was because of that, that when he inserted mana to the tear, the pain wasn’t that severe.

‘Although I couldn’t find the cause in the end, it became easier to learn the Flamdor mana technique.’

But of course, the speed of accumulating mana was still slow.

Roan wrote out the deployment of the soldiers in the storage and climbed down the mountain.

Soon, the soldiers were all gathered up.

The results of asking their opinions was that most of them couldn’t find strange points.

They just replied that the feeling it gave wasn’t good.

But Pens was certainly different.

“Looking at the location of the camp, the deployment, and the number of soldiers it seems like a real storage. But……”

He seemed to hesitate for a moment and then, continued saying.

“Looking at the armors, weapons, movements, and military discipline, they are an excessively powerful force. Although it’s true that the location of the storage is important, taking into account that the front line is in a deadlock, it doesn’t make sense that they are leaving this strong force in the rear.”

At those words Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

Although Pens couldn’t grasp the flow of mana as he didn’t have Kalian’s tear, but instead, made the same conclusion after looking at the equipment and the faces.

“Yes, I also think like that. They don’t look like soldiers protecting the storage.”

Roan replied in a low voice.

“They have an attacking posture that seems like they may be attacked at any moment.”

He took in a deep breath.

His sight moved to below the storage.

“Even so, this place…….”

He smiled bitterly towards Pens.

“Seems like a trap.”

Oren and his agency would probably also have analyzed and checked the storage thoroughly.

‘Even I was about to get tricked.’

Roan looked at Pens.

‘But Pens found weird points even without Kalian’s tear.’

He was amazed at his abilities.

‘Why wasn’t someone like this known in my past life?’

The most famous people in the agency were Chris and Oren.

He didn’t have any memories about Pens.

And Roan also didn’t know until now.

That his role was quite big in making Pens bloom an ability he hadn’t even thought about in this life.

*****

Roan, Pens, and the soldiers safely returned to the camp of Lancephil.

And Oren and the others also did.

Aaron, Roan, Pens, and Oren found Io’s tent once again.

‘It’s been decided.’

Io could know the results even without asking.

Aaron, who was smiling faintly, and the stiff expression of Oren.

But even so, he couldn’t make a decision beforehand.

“Has the truth and fake been revealed?”

At those words Aaron hid his expression and bowed.

“Unfortunately, it was shown that the location Oren’s agency found was a trap.”

He gave the information Roan gathered, analyzed, and organized to Io.

Io looked at the pile of papers and asked Oren.

“How was your side?”

At those words Oren smacked his lips for a moment and then replied with a low voice.

“The results of our agency having checked on the storage the 7th corps found……”

He let out a short sigh and continued saying.

“We speculate that it’s the real deal.”

At those words, Aaron’s expression became even brighter.

On the other hand, the expressions of Roan and Pens didn’t have any change.

Io checked the pile of paper Oren gave him thoroughly and then nodded.

“You all have done well. Because of that, we could separate the storages between fake and real.”

He looked at the knights, mages, and the captains that were seated at his side and continued saying.

“The opportunity to finally end this war has come.”

They exchanged opinions and talked about tactics and strategies about how to attack the supply storage.

“Whew.”

Io let out a long sigh with a relieved expression.

“Then, each commander is to prepare to depart.”

“Yes!”

At the order, everyone replied in one voice.

Only then could Aaron, Roan, Pens, and Oren get out of the tent.

Even before they could take some steps, Oren blocked Pens.

“Mister Pens.”

He spoke in a blunt expression and voice.

However, his eyes were shining strongly.

He extended his right hand.

“This time, we……”

Oren hesitated for a moment and then continued saying.

“No, I lost. I realized that I still lack a lot.”

Pens grabbed the hand Oren extended.

“As I paid too much attention on the number of the soldiers, the location, the formation, and the composition, we were neglectful in observing the people.”

Roan, who was listening at the sides, was slightly surprised.

‘Oren also realized his mistake.’

Certainly, someone that was born with it was born with it.

Oren looked at Pens’ eyes fixedly.

“Next time, I won’t lose.”

At those words, Pens who was absentminded, said with a casual expression.

“It’s fine if you win the next time.”

At the unexpected words, Oren frowned.

‘Is he feeling sympathy for me?’

When he thought like that.

Pens continued saying.

“I just hope for our allies to win.”

He spoke one heavy sentence.

Oren’s face stiffened.

He looked at Pens’s expression for a moment and after letting go of the hand, he started to walk away.

Aaron looked at Oren’s back, who was getting further away, and mumbled in a low voice.

“He took one, no, two blows by Pens.”

At those words, Pens just laughed.

Roan hit Pens’s shoulders and smiled.

“The location of the storage you and the information agency found with difficulty…..”

He put strength in his voice.

“I will pay you back with victory.”

At those words, Pens replied shortly.

“Yes. That’s enough for me.”

Chapter 75




Sponsored chapter

After two days, Count Lancephil and the 7th corps organized their camp and fell back to the west.

No, precisely speaking, they pretended to fall back.

Actually, the army consisting of more than 10,000 divided into small troops and moved towards the supply storage the 7th corps discovered.

In this process, the gathered and analyzed information Oren and Pens brought was of great help.

The army charged through enemy territory while using the safest and most secret route.

They didn’t only move.

Different than the main force, a troop consisting of 2,000 soldiers went to the fake storage Oren’s agency made it look like it was on purpose.

They moved to pretend like they had fallen in the trap.

Lastly Io, who remained at the rear of the camp, sent a report to Benjamin saying that they would attack Istel kingdom’s headquarters.

They were measures to raise the chances of victory even by a little bit more.

Meanwhile, the 10,000 soldiers that were divided into small troops used the night and dawn to move to the east little by little.

Their destination was the entrance of a plains located near the boundary of the east.

Because the location of Istel kingdom’s storage was between mountains, it was difficult for Rinse kingdom to grasp that location.

Rinse kingdom’s army made a turn on a mountain at the west and went into a deep part of enemy territory.

Based on the reconnaissance of the information troop and Oren’s agency, most of the enemy’s forces were gathered in the eastern part of the mountain.

Because of that, they didn’t face them head on, but aimed for their backs.

Rinse kingdom arrived at their destination after ten days had passed.

And there were also many cases where the small troops were discovered by the enemies and were killed or had fled.

The soldiers that arrived at the appointed time numbered 9,000.

They hid themselves and didn’t move until the sun had set and darkness fell.

Roan looked at the storage located at the end of the plains.

Their preparations certainly seemed solid.

‘However, the number of knights is lower than the fake storage.’

Istel kingdom had used too many resources in carving the trap.

‘The number of soldiers that have mana in their bodies are merely 30.’

It was clearly nighttime, but because of Kalian’s tear, he didn’t have any problems in checking the camp.

‘Compared to that, the knights of Count Lancephil amount to more than 50.’

On top of that, there were also ten mages.

Although Istel kingdom had more normal soldiers, in terms of soldiers quality, they were quite ahead.

‘But of course, what they show won’t be everything.’

They wouldn’t manage a place so important that may determine defeat or victory so sloppily.

But even so, Roan was confident.

‘In their position, it would be a surprise attack from an unexpected direction and one which they wouldn’t even have been able to think of.’

On top of that, the morale of Rinse kingdom was as high as the sky.

‘But even so, we have a need to check if there are other traps or not.’

Roan checked the storage thoroughly to not make the same mistakes as before.

‘Hm?’

His sight was fixed in one place.

He was looking at a wooden fence that was on the left of the entrance.

‘The flow of mana is strange.’

Precisely speaking, the air above that was weird.

‘There’s a fixed flow above the empty air of the fence.’

Normally, if it was a place filled with mana, it would move everywhere without any rules.

‘Maybe?’

What he had were suspicions of this in this situation.

‘A magic array?’

Roan frowned.

The weakest point that was related to wars and battles.

That was the things related to magic.

His sight moved once again to the air above the fence.

The mana flowed just like a whirlpool.

‘It seems like the core of the magic array……’

But he couldn’t be certain.

He didn’t know anything about that field.

Then, he saw the leader of the mages, Tairo Bess, moving busily.

Roan pretended to take care of the soldiers and followed his back.

Tairo went to find Kali Owells, who was in charge of the supreme commands.

“Commander Owells. In the process of mana scanning, we have discovered a magic array.”

It was just like Roan had thought.

Kali frowned.

“A magic array? What kind of magic?”

“It’s Grand Shield.”

Grand shield.

It was a huge scaled protection magic.

It was the specialty of a school that used magic as it’s theme.

Although they were useless existences in a 1vs1 battle or surprise attacks, but they accomplished quite an outstanding role in defending, just like right now.

“Mmm. They are more thoroughly prepared than what I thought.”

Kali exclaimed and shook his head.

‘If we can’t make the grand shield powerless, this tactic becomes a failure.’

There were two methods.

‘One is to attack the grand shield until it breaks.’

Although it was a solid shield, it wasn’t that it couldn’t break.

However, you needed quite a lot of time and effort in a situation where you didn’t have siege weapons or cavalrymen.

‘The second method……..’

Was to destroy the core of the array.

The core was the center and essence that permitted the magir array to be maintained.

“Have you found the core of the array?”

At Kali’s questions, Tairo shook his head.

“It’s impossible to scan it at this distance.”

Kali nodded.

He also knew about this truth.

‘For now, we can only approach as much as we can.’

They couldn’t just stall for time by waiting.

The moment they discovered that the other party attacked the fake storage was a bait, the tide would change once again.

They had to end the battle before that.

It was a situation where they had to hope for the mages to find the core of the array quickly.

‘Tch. If the skills of the mages were a bit better……’

He smacked his lips at the regretting feeling.

If the abilities of the mages were great, they would be able to use mana scan, dispel, and attack magic to make the grand shield powerless.

However, the level of Lancephil’s mages weren’t that high.

No, it wasn’t only them.

Right now, it was difficult to find high classed mages.

‘After all the dragons disappeared, they started to decay little by little.’

Even so, as many schools appeared and developed in their own specialties, they were able to preserve their existence.

However, it was true that the effectiveness in wars and battles declined even more.

‘Rather, the shamans are giving treatment.’

Kali sighed and shook his head.

‘If it becomes like this, we can only fire thousands of arrows without stop.’

If they were lucky, one of them may pierce through the core.

He organized his thoughts and raised his right hand.

“We are moving as close as possible to the storage.”

In the end, they could only clash.

The soldiers placed their right fist in their chest instead of replying.

Sususu.

The wind of dawn shook the grass.

Meanwhile, the Rinse kingdom army started to move stealthily.

The knights of Lancephil were at the front, behind them the region’s army, and behind them the 7th corps followed. And at the rear, there were the 10 mages taking their place.

Kali, who stood at the front, soon arrived near the storage.

“Mages.”

At the lowly calling sound, the mages who were at the rear started to come to the front.

The two arms that appeared below the robes.

They executed the mana scan in front of the huge storage.

Silence.

The nasty silence just continued.

Rinse kingdom couldn’t even breathe loudly for fear of being discovered.

However, even after quite a lot of time had passed, the mages couldn’t find the core.

Tairo’s expression stiffened even more.

In the end, Kali couldn’t endure it and asked.

“You still couldn’t find it?”

“I’m sorry.”

Tairo bowed.

The size of the storage was too immense.

For only ten mages to scan the whole place thoroughly was nearly impossible.

Kali took in a deep breath.

‘We can’t keep wasting time like this.’

If it wasn’t the best option, they had to go with the second best one.

“The mages are to keep looking for the core.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Tairo nodded and moved to the side.

Kali pulled his long sword.

“Prepare to fire. We are pouring arrows down on them.”

“Yes.”

The leader of the territory’s army, Perr Wilson, shortly replied and prepared the archers.

Chiiik!

Fire was put on the tip of the arrows.

“Fire!”

Right before he finished the order, the archers fired off their arrows.

Sweeeeee!

Thousands of arrows split the wind along with a sharp sound.

It was an intent that seemed to pierce through the tents, and sacks.

However.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

A displeasing sound of metal rang out.

The thousands of arrows hit on the empty air above the fences like a lie and fell to the ground.

The arrows that fell caught fire.

“It really was grand shield.”

Kali frowned.

Then.

Piiiiiii!

A sharp sound carved in their ears.

“They even prepared an alarm magic?”

Certainly, there was no way they would protect the storage sloppily.

At the sound of the alarm magic, the soldiers of Istel started to gather one by one.

Anyways, the surprise attack was now useless. But even so, it wasn’t a hopeless situation.

Because the grand shield didn’t differentiate between inside or outside, friend or foe.

Just like Rinse kingdom couldn’t get inside the storage, Istel kingdom also couldn’t get outside of it.

‘We have to finish this before their reinforcements come.’

If the day was bright, the enemy troop would come to assist them.

They had to break the grand shield before that.

Sweeeeeeek!

Hundreds, thousands of arrows split the night sky.

Then.

Tat!

One young soldier moved out of the ranks and ran towards the storage.

“Huh?”

“What is it?”

Kali and the knights all frowned.

“Roan!”

Aaron, who discovered the identity of the young soldier late, yelled in a loud voice.

At that moment.

Roan took a big step with his left leg and threw his spear.

Swaaaaaa!

The sound was different than the one from the arrows.

The spear shook like a fish and flew towards the grand shield.

“That stupid bastard.”

“He thinks that a spear mcan do it because an arrow can’t.”

The knights clicked their tongues and shook their heads.

However, Roan’s expression was quite calm.

He could see something others couldn’t.

‘Right. Just go like that!’

Roan’s sight moved over the core of the array.

He put an earnest desire behind the spear.

The spear split the air and precisely pierced the core of the array.

Bang!

A sound exploded.

At the same time.

Craaaak.

Just like ice was breaking.

Poong!

The grand shield, that received a dent, was completely destroyed and disappeared.

“Huh?!”

“What?”

“Uh?”

At that moment, an awkward atmosphere fell over the battlefield.

It was obvious for Rinse kingdom, but Istel kingdom was also surprised at the sudden situation.

The two sides just blinked with their mouths hanging wide open.

Then, Roan yelled towards Kali.

“Commander!!!”

Only then did Kali get a hold of himself.

“Ah, Ah!”

Still, he had a confused expression.

‘Fo, for the grand shield to break!’

He raised his long sword high.

‘I will have to check if he was lucky or if he has something else after the battle.’

As soon as he got ahold of himself, suspicions came first.

But that was something for later.

Now was the time to attack the open storage.

Kali raised his sword.

“Charge!”

The order was finally sent.

The 10,000 soldiers charged towards the storage with a fierce intent.

“Block them!”

“Fire arrows!”

The counterattack of the Istel kingdom also wasn’t light.

‘If this storage gets taken over, everything ends!’

They were desperate.

‘Damn. For the grand shield to break this quickly.’

The grand shield was to protect them in case they were attacked until reinforcements came.

But that grand shield was broken by only one spear.

What was fortunate was that they could prepare to some degree because of Grand shield and the alarm magic, even if it wasn’t perfect.

Bang!

The entrance and the fences broke and Rinse kingdom entered over them.

“Sons of bitches!”

“Die!”

Rinse kingdom ground their teeth.

Swords, axes, and spears split the air.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Sparks flew along with the sound of metal.

Sweeeee!

Arrows flew without stop from both sides.

Flaaaaame!

The inside and the outside of the storage started to transform to a sea of fire.

“Fireball!”

From here, the mages of Count Lancephil attacked.

Following the extended arms, fireballs split the wind.

‘Kuk! Dman. It was our mistake to have sent most of the knights and mages to the fake storage.’

The commanders of Istel kingdom clenched their fists.

‘We certainly, heard that the Rinse bastards were heading to the trap we had prepared, but were we the ones that took the blow?!’

Their bodies trembled.

At the sides, the voices of Rinse soldiers was heard.

“Set it on fire!”

“Let’s show an example to the Istel bastards!”

Bonfires crumbled and torches flew over.

At the same time, thousands of flaming arrows covered the sky.

Pung! Pubung!

The tents caught on fire and started to spread to the insides following the wind.

“Put the fires off!”

“Protect the supplies!”

The commanders of Istel yelled and urged the soldiers.

“Hmph! Useless sounds!”

Kali was a problem because he was narrow minded and fought desperately, but at least his skills were great.

He lead the 50 knights and massacred the soldiers of Istel kingdom.

“We are the knight guards of Lancephil’s family!”

A loud yell rang out.

It was a voice filled with pride.

Then, a serious voice was heard from the other side.

“Bastards! We are the cool breeze knights of Istel kingdom!”

30 knights came running with a fierce intent.

Bang!

Knight against knight.

Knight squad against a Knight squad.

A confrontation occurred in the middle of the fiery storage.

Leaving them in the middle, the soldiers from both sides started to fight in confusion.

Flaaaaaaame!

The fires burned more fiercely.

Finally, it gulped down the tents that had the provision sacks in it.

Tadak. Tadak.

Fire and sparks flew to the air.

A dark smoke blew with the wind.

It seemed like a rain of fire was raining inside the storage.

‘This is a battlefield.’

Roan looked at the fire laying down over his armour and took a breath.

It was because he felt full of vitality even when he hadn’t operated the Flamdor mana technique.

The red flames surging up at his sides.

The scattering fire.

This place was just like heaven for him.

A battlefield of fire.

Roan gripped his spear.

Behind him, rose troop appeared with Austin and Harrison at the front.

“Troop commander.”

Austin’s voice was only slightly trembling.

And not only him.

The adam’s apple of all the other soldiers were moving roughly up and down.

Roan slightly turned his head and looked at the nervous expressions of the troop’s soldiers.

They had eyes that were as hot as the flames.

Roan’s mouth slightly moved.

He had a smile that made you feel assured.

Soon, a low voice but with strength was heard.

“Just trust in me and follow me.”

Chapter 76




Rose troop and the 2nd rose troop were clearly different than the other troops.

They didn’t lose their ranks and formations even in the middle of the chaos.

They had a well-ordered look.

Everyone moved as if they were one.

Slash! Stab!

Every time the spear split the air, one soldier of Istel kingdom fell hopelessly.

“Where?”

The attacks of the enemies aiming for the openings were blocked by the soldiers at the sides.

“Scatter!”

At Austin’s orders, the soldiers that were gathered like a rock were scattered everywhere.

The soldiers of Istel kingdom, that were pushing stubbornly, had their feet tied at the sudden change.

That short instant.

At the moment that was created, the archers at the rear fired arrows.

Pubububuk!

“Kuk!”

“Kugh!”

The soldiers of Istel kingdom became porcupines and collapsed.

As Austin clenched his fists again, the soldiers that were scattered gathered once again to become a rock.

Their stabbed their spears at the hearts of the confused enemies.

There was no mercy in a war.

Then.

“Then!”

One young knight of Istel kingdom came charging in with a high intent.

As the performance of rose troop and the 2nd troop was too eye catching, he was planning to cut them off.

The sword had mana behind it and came stabbing towards Austin.

This was a situation of life and death.

But even so, not even one soldier of rose troop retreated or stepped back.

Rather, they glared at the young knight in front of them.

“Ridiculous things! Mere normal soldiers dares to a knight……”

When he talked up to there.

A sharp spear appeared from the sides.

Kang!

A heavy sound of metal rang out.

The spear hit the side of the sword of the young knight precisely.

“Kugh!”

The young knight frowned at the numbness felt in his palms and turned his head.

‘What kind of bastard dares!’

The man fended off the attack of his sword.

He had a childish face, but the moment he saw his face, he lost his breath.

‘Fi, fire?’

The owner of the spear resembled a red flame.

“Who, who are you?”

The young knight was asking unconsciously.

The owner of the spear swung his spear first, instead of replying.

“Kugh!”

The young knight stepped back hurriedly and swung his sword.

Sparks flew alongside the sound of metal.

The owner of the spear charged the ground like that and closed the distance.

“I’m troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop belonging to the 7th corps of the eastern army of Rinse kingdom.”

At those words, the young knight frowned.

“Tro, troop commander?! Not a knight?”

He stabbed his sword towards Roan who was already in front of him.

Roan twisted his body calmly.

The sword split the air.

At that moment.

Roan’s left hand carved into the left armpit of the young knight.

“Uhh!”

The young knight staggered because he was perplexed.

Roan flung his waist while he still had his arm at his side.

The young knight drew a line and flew to the air.

Boom!

He rolled on the ground along with a heavy sound.

“Kugh.”

His back and waist felt numb.

Roan stepped on his chest with his right foot.

The young knight struggled to stand up.

‘Kuk! Just how strong is he…….’

However, his body didn’t move as he wished.

At this point, curses of wanting to live surged up.

“I, i’m the disciple of a noble family of Istel kingdom and a knight. If you capture me, you’d be able to……”

But he couldn’t continue his words.

Stab.

Because Roan’s spear had already pierced his throat.

There was no mercy in war.

‘Especially, even more so in battles like this one.’

Roan pulled his spear out and faced the soldiers charging at him.

Every time his spear danced, three or four soldiers fell.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out of Austin’s mouth.

It kind of felt like the surrounding fire was dancing alongside Roan.

He mumbled in a half absent minded expression.

“Perhaps, perhaps.”

Keep, who was right next to him, frowned.

“DId you say something?”

Austin followed Roan’s back and said.

“We may be looking at the start of a legend.”

However Keep couldn’t hear properly because of the loud noise of the battlefield.

“What did you say?!”

But Austin didn’t mind.

He now mumbled in a voice so low it couldn’t be heard by anyone.

“No, we are together with the start of a legend.”

He felt his chest heave up.

Austin raised his spear high.

“Follow troop commander Roan!”

At that order, rose troop went into formation once again.

Roan had already opened a path.

The soldiers aimed for that and massacred the enemy.

Austin yelled in a loud voice towards Roan.

“Troop commander Roan! We will follow you until the end!”

In this battle, and even after this battle ended.

You couldn’t know if Roan knew what he truly meant or not, but he raised his thumb after he cut off the neck of an enemy.

And then, he slightly turned his head and looked at his troop.

“I told you before.”

There was a comforting smile still on his mouth.

“To follow me while trusting in me.”

The battle was coming to a close like that.

*****

The dawn could be seen from the east.

The battle had ended.

The supply storage of Istel kingdom had been swept up by red flames.

Huge flames that seemed to be there forever.

However, they didn’t have time to rest while extending their limbs.

“We will chase the bastards that escaped to the southwest of our Lancephil’s territory.”

The soldiers that were protecting the storage fled to the sides when the battle was coming to an end.

It didn’t matter for the ones that fled to the east, but they couldn’t just sit still for the ones that fled to the west.

At Kali’s words, Aaron nodded.

“My 7th corps will also chase and kill them and after that go to the headquarters of the eastern region.”

They bid their short farewells.

Kali lead his army first and departed to the southwest.

Aaron hurriedly gathered the troop commanders and reformed it.

“Our actual number is approximately 4,000. We will divide the army in two.”

The decision was fast.

Although they had burned down the supply storage, it was still too early to relax.

There was still the main army of Istel kingdom, and there still were many knights and soldiers at the fake storage.

‘If we stay here any longer, we may get left behind in enemy territory.’

They had to chase the ones that fled as quick as possible and regroup with the main army.

“I’ll be leading one, and Roan will lead the other one. I’ll go to the southwest, so Roan, you go to the west.”

Several troop commanders died in battle.

Now, even by taking merits into account, performances, trust, etc. there was no such commander like Roan.

Although there also was also Gale, he was performing the role of staff officer next to Aaron.

So Roan became the provisional vice corps commander.

“Yes. I understand.”

He didn’t dare to decline.

‘I moderately receive what needs to be received.’

That was Roan’s way of thinking.

The reforming of the group was done quickly.

“Have a good fight.”

“Let’s meet at the headquarters in the east.”

Aaron and Roan looked at each other and faintly smiled.

Each troop put the burning storage behind them and went to the south and the southwest.

*****

The 2,000 soldiers conforming the 2nd rose troop.

They received Roan’s command and annihilated the scattered Istel kingdom forces.

In this process, the abilities of Pens and the information agency shined once again.

Although it wasn’t systematized properly, they found the feeling route and traces of the enemy and their tracking ability was towering above the rest.

“It seems like we took care of most of them.”

This was Austin’s report.

Roan looked at the corpses of the Istel kingdom’s soldiers and nodded.

This was already the 13th subjugation.

Meanwhile, they had perfectly annihilated the small and large groups.

‘The side of corps commander Aaron would already have regrouped with the main army.’

Looking at the direction, Aaron’s side was closer to the headquarters.

Roan turned his head and looked at the south.

‘From here on, it would be better to leave the western region to the army of Count Lancephil.’

It was time to return to the headquarters.

‘The main force of Istel won’t be able to last much lomger either.’

They were out of supplies, and the supply line was cut off.

On top of that, excluding the main army, all the other groups were getting massacred.

Although they still had many soldiers left in the headquarters, they didn’t have the leisure or the morale to do so anymore.

On top of that, the supreme commander leading Istel kingdom’s forces was Mark Istel.

He was royalty that was quite close to the king of Istel.

They wouldn’t leave someone like Mark in the cave of a tiger.

Retreating was a clear thing.

“We’re going to the south.”

A voice said with strength.

Austin and the soldiers saluted shortly and bowed.

They put the battlefield under control and moved towards the south.

As most of the soldiers were infantry, the movement speed wasn’t as fast as he had thought.

On top of that, most of them were exhausted from the continued battles.

Roan rested moderately and moved.

‘Soon, the final battle will happen.’

He needed to save energy for that.

On the second day of travelling.

He could finally see the camp of the eastern army.

Roan, who was at the front, frowned.

Because the camp seemed kind of weird.

‘Something’s lacking.’

The camp was empty.

His footsteps became quicker at the uneasy feeling.

“Stop!”

The guards that were protecting the entrance crossed spears and yelled.

Roan stood at the front and yelled.

“It’s the 7th corps!”

The guards checked the flag and the rank badge.

“Ah! It’s troop commander Roan of the 7th corps!”

On top of that, Roan’s face was quite famous.

The guards hurriedly opened the gates.

“Sir!”

Roan lead the troop and moved inside the camp.

He ordered the soldiers to rest and moved towards the center of the camp.

A place that had tents for the corps commanders.

However, most of the tents were empty.

‘Ah!’

Then, someone caught his eye.

It was corps commander Phillip Hass of the 5th corps.

“Commander Hass!”

“Mmm?”

Phillip turned his head at the sound calling out to him and then smiled.

“It’s Roan of the 7th corps.”

“Sir.”

Roan approached even more and saluted.

“I heard the notices. You’ve raised quite a big merit.”

“Thank you.”

At Phillip’s compliment, Roan bowed and then looked at the camp.

“But the camp feels quite empty.”

At those words, the smile on Phillip’s face became even denser.

“Everyone went to chase the main army of Istel.”

“The enemy’s main army? They had already retreated?”

Although he certainly expected for a retreat, the time was just too fast.

As Roan asked back in a surprised face, Phillip’s nodded.

“Right. Although it was yesterday that we realized that they had retreated, actually it was way before that since they retreated.”

“Can you tell me in detail?”

Roan wanted to know where the situation was flowing to.

Phillip explained with a composed voice.

“Corps commander Aaron regrouped in the camp and a force also regrouped in Istel’s headquarters. They say it was the force waiting in the fake storage.”

He looked at the east.

“Not even preparing to retreat, but they had regrouped? We certainly thought that they would be preparing for the last attack. Although small troops of each side had clashed against each other, it didn’t have that big of a meaning. Because we thought that the real battle would happen later on.”

Phillip looked at Roan once more.

“But four days ago, the small scaled battles were cut off. They didn’t come out of their camp. Instead, they just hit jings and drums. We thought that it was to raise the morale for the last battle. But that was completely mistaken thinking.”

A hopeless look was in his eyes.

“They didn’t move even after four days had passed. So we sent a troop to their camp and provoked them. But even so, they didn’t show any reactions. We fired arrows and threw rocks but it was the same. In the end, we were determined to die and charged into their camp. But…….”

“It was empty.”

At Roan’s words, Phillip nodded.

“The sounds of the jing and drums were fake sounds made with a recording magic. They had retreated rather early. Just like when we retreated in the region of Bink.”

“Mmm.”

Roan gulped the exclamation.

‘It’s earlier than what I thought.’

But it meant that the situation was that bad.

‘Or they may have summoned Mark Istel a bit in a hurry.’

Although you couldn’t do anything about a defeat, you had to save the life of royalty.

If the supreme commander was a normal soldier instead of royalty like Mark, they would have continued doing war regardless of dying.

‘Anyways, even if they returned to their kingdom, there was a high possibility to be beheaded or lose territory.’

Defeat in a war was that much of a sin.

‘However, a severe punishment isn’t always a good thing. Anyways……’

Roan’s eyes slightly trembled.

‘Recording magic……’

It certainly was uncommon.

But even so, retreating more than 5,000 soldiers without getting caught was quite a difficult feat.

‘Was there a commander that outstanding in their ranks?’

He had perfectly grasped the situation of the commanders of Istel while preparing for war and while the war progressed.

However, there wasn’t that kind of dangerous existence among the commanders.

‘Now that I see it, the strategy of the fake storage wasn’t that easy……’

As he reviewed it again, he thought that there were many things he had thought of lightly.

The feeling of lightning thundered in his head.

Roan rummaged through the memories of his past life.

Several battles and wars passed through his head.

‘Among the outstanding existences in Istel kingdom………’

In the age of great wars, geniuses appeared not only in Rinse kingdom, but in each continent.

Precisely because of that, the age of great wars happened.

‘If it wasn’t for that, a kingdom or empire would have gotten annihilated.’

Roan shook his head.

‘If it’s an existence of Istel kingdom, it would be at most the fox of the battle field Count Peid Nail………’

But there wasn’t a name like that among the names of the commanders Chris’s agency and the information troop provided him.

‘On top of that, he’s merely in his twentie…..’

WHen he thought like that.

Roan’s eyes opened.

“Ah!”

An exclamation came out of his mouth.

“What happened?”

Phillip tilted his head and asked.

However Roan didn’t even have the mind to reply.

He bowed towards Phillips.

“I’m sorry. An urgent thing suddenly occurred, so I’ll have to leave.”

“Huh? Right. Then……..”

Phillip couldn’t even say goodbye.

Roan was already showing his back.

“Cheop.”

Phillip smacked his lips with an awkward expression.

‘Just what’s the urgent thing……..Hhm.’

His sight followed Roan’s back.

Roan ran towards the place the soldiers were resting without stop.

“Mister Pens!”

An urgent yell.

Pens, that was resting between the soldiers, stood up.

Roan made hand signs with an urgent expression.

“Give me the register of the Istel kingdom.”

Pens tilted his head at the sudden request.

“Register? If it’s the register, you would probably have…..”

Roan shook his head.

“Not commanders above troop commanders, but the registers of adjutants.”

“Adjutants? That was too massive so we couldn’t organize it yet.”

Pens replied with a perplexed expression.

Roan nodded as if it was fine.

“It doesn’t matter.”

“Wa, wait a moment.”

Only then did Pens realize that something wasn’t right.

He rummaged his bag and then took out a pile of papers the size of two palms.

“It’s here.”

“Thank you.”

As soon as he received the papers, Roan sat on the ground.

Flip. Flip.

The sound of flipping paper was heard clearly.

Pens and the other soldiers started to gather one by one.

However Roan didn’t mind and concentrated on the letters of the paper.

“Peid. Peid. Peid………’

For now, it was important to find that name.

The names that were written in a disorganized way.

His finger swept up the letters quickly.

How long has it passed.

Almost half of the papers were flipped.

‘Right. Please, don’t appear.’

Roan gulped dry saliva and flipped the papers once again.

Flip. Tuk.

At that moment, the finger stopped like a lie.

‘Peid.’

There it was.The name he didn’t want to see was clearly written.

The contents written were just that.

But it was enough even with that.

Roan’s face stiffened.

‘It’s that bastard. The fox of the battlefield. It’s that guy.’

He abruptly stood up.

He couldn’t think of it.

The geniuses that represented each kingdom in the age of great wars.

As he concentrated on the battles and the war, he had forgotten the truth of their existence for a moment.

‘The commanders had to ignore him and neglect him……’

However, if it was him that incentivated the retreat, it meant that his position had risen to a good place.

‘The fox of the battlefield wouldn’t simply retreat.’

Even Ian, who was one of the genius strategists and the pride of Rinse, was done in by him three times.

‘I have to chase the army of the eastern region.’

He had to stop them so they couldn’t chase them anymore.

Roan gave the papers to Pens and called Austin.

“Get ready to depart as quickly as possible.”

“Charging?”

Austin asked back with an expression as if what had happened.

Roan looked at the east.

“We are going to the east.”

At those words, some soldiers said.

“Are we chasing the enemy?”

“Are we chasing the main army of Istel?”

The expressions and voices were a bit excited.

They had finished the war and were quite excited.

However Roan was calm.

No, it rather felt like he was kind of low.

He said in a voice he seemed to be mumbling.

“We are rescuing our allies.”

Chapter 77




The fox of the battlefield, Peid Neil.

Area Britch, the venomous spider of Melland.

The black shark, Jeff.

The existences he could think for now were these three.

‘The geniuses that lead Istel kingdom into the age of great war.’

Roan shook his head while riding his horse.

‘Now, I also have to worry about the geniuses of other kingdoms.’

He didn’t know if the age of great war would come a bit quicker or slower because of his influence.

‘Although I’d like it if it didn’t happen at all……..’

Anyways, it was true that he had to put in more attention than now.

Roan looked back.

The soldiers looked exhausted.

But even so, he came out with the ones that knew how to ride a horse.

‘Right now, speed is life.’

He ran and ran without stop.

Because of that, he could catch up with them in two days.

‘They were already done.’

Roan passed by the soldiers of the main army and ground his teeth.

There were too many injured for them to be the chasing ones.

On top of that, even the morale was a mess.

‘Where’s the 7th corps?’

He thoroughly checked the rear and went to the front, but he couldn’t see the 7th corps at all.

While he was frowning, he entered the commanding headquarters that was located between the center and the rear.

He saw Benjamin and the corps commander moving between the injured soldiers while riding their horses.

They had a look of failure.

Roan passed the reins to Austin and walked towards Benjamin.

“Commander!”

Benjamin, who was slowly riding his horse, looked at Roan and frowned.

He tilted his head for a moment and then put on a sickly smile.

“You are Roan of the 7th corps.”

“Yes. I’m vice troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop.”

“I heard the notices that your merits were excellent.”

He had a kind of reproachful expression.

Roan quickly went to the main topic.

“According to the analysis of the information troop, the rearguard of the enemy………”

When he talked up to there, Benjamin shook his hand with a blunt expression.

“Again with that information agency?”

He had already heard of the performance of the information of the 7th corps through the corps commanders, staff officers, and even the soldiers themselves.

Benjamin didn’t like that the 7th corps had achieved a more remarkable merit than himself.

He said with a brusque voice.

“It’s already after we fell into their trap and ambush.”

Benjamin’s sight moved over the injured soldiers.

‘Certainly…..’

The fox of the battlefield was a fox even when he was young.

Roan bit his lower lip.

‘I have to stop him now.’

Saying his opinion to a supreme commander.

And having to speak back with his opinion was not complying to the military discipline.

On top of that, Benjamin was narrow minded and still lacking.

He wasn’t someone to receive Roan’s opinion.

‘Anyways, can’t do anything about it.’

He couldn’t let their allies suffer a big blow even while knowing that it couldn’t be done.

“We have to stop the chase immediatel……”

Roan couldn’t finish his words once again.

Benjamin put on an even sicker smile than before and interrupted him.

“Aaron Tate already went to the chase while leading the 7th and 6th corps.”

“Yes?”

Roan opened his eyes wide at the unexpected words.

‘The 7th corps went to the chase?’

He thought maybe when he didn’t see Aaron, Gale, and the several adjutants and soldiers.

‘Damn. I thought that if it was Benjamin, he wouldn’t give the chance for the 7th corps to accumulate more merits.’

He felt stifled.

Benjamin, who was looking at that Roan, had quite fierce eyes.

‘At first, I stood at the front and gave chase.’

It was to accumulate merits.

Compared to the 7th corps that had accumulated small and big merits, Benjamin and the eastern army hadn’t done much.

However, he’d be able to gain an incredible merit by slaying the supreme commander Mark at the last moment.

But of course, it wasn’t simply to accumulate merits.

‘There’s a rumour of Count Lancephil reporting the merits to the royal palace himself.’

If he made a mistake, he could get his territory taken away by Aaron.

And not only that.

‘There’s also movements of the corps commanders of the region gathering around Aaron.’

A new force could be made in the eastern region.

For Benjamin, who wanted to make his basic force more solid and climb to somewhere higher, the 7th corps became a thorn for him.

Benjamin could stand up for the chase for several reasons.

However.

‘For the Istel bastards to install traps, ambushes, and fire tactics even while fleeing.’

And it wasn’t at the level where they could block it even if they knew about it.

Their attack was that scary.

In the end, he just ended up losing soldiers instead of raising merits.

Meanwhile, some corps commanders praised the 7th corps and made him feel annoyed.

In the end, Benjamin changed his thoughts.

‘Rather than approaching the eastern boundary that becomes the plains, let’s put the 7th corps at the front of the chase.’

He was planning to pass the dangerous places like rivers, mountains, and forests to the 7th corps.

‘If in that process they get done in by the Istel bastards, the merits they accumulated until now will become foam….’

The commanders that wanted to gather around Aaron would also lose their intent.

On top of that, he could lower the retreating speed of Istel kingdom.

In Benjamin’s situation, it was three birds with one stone.

‘If we just get to the plains, they won’t be able to use tactics such as ambushes or surprise attacks.’

By then, he was planning to stand at the front and sweep them all up.

‘I’m finishing the war with my hands.’

The fantastical finishing touch was drawn in his head.

He put a sickly smile towards Roan.

“If it’s Aaron and he 7th corps, they already have what they showed until now…….”

But the cynical voice lost it’s direction and dispersed.

Tat!

Roan charged the ground and grabbed the reins.

He didn’t have time to listen to Benjamin’s nonsense.

‘I have to chase the 7th corps before it gets too late.’

They could still be safe.

‘No, they certainly are.’

He didn’t want to think about bad things.

The faces of Aaron, Gale, Keniss, Dosen, and several soldiers appeared in front of his eyes.

Roan pulled the reins and looked back.

He saw the faces of Austin and the soldiers of 2nd rose troop.

“I’m going to rescue the 7th corps.”

He spoke in a heated voice.

And eyes that were even hotter than that.

“It probably won’t be an easy thing.”

The gazes of Roan and the soldiers interlocked.

“The ones that want to stay, can do so.”

At those words, Austin and the soldiers looked at each other and then burst out in laughter.

“Troop commander. What are you talking about?”

There was no hesitation on their faces.

“You said to follow you while trusting in you.”

Austin hit his armour with his right fist.

“We’ll only follow troop commander until we die.”

At those words, Roan didn’t say anything.

He just nodded and looked towards the east.

He yelled loudly before kicking his horse.

“Well then. Let’s go and take back the 7th corps!”

Hiiiiiing!

The horse cried roughly and charged the ground.

“Yap!”

“Chase them!”

Austin and the others followed his back.

Horses and soldiers.

Although both of them seemed exhausted, the morale was excellent.

The 500 soldiers faced the sun with their backs and ran towards the east.

*****

Two middle aged men looked at the plains while riding their horses.

The man with a thick face and clear eyes and nose smiled.

“The one who came up with the rearguard tactic was an adjutant called Peid?”

At those words, the man with small eyes bowed.

“Yes. He was the senior adjutant of the fort troop Teise Martin was leading.”

“Did you say he’s merely 22?”

“Yes. He’s still a complete greenhorn.”

“Can you call someone that could think of that tactic a greenhorn?”

The clear eyed man pointed at the plain and shook his head.

It was a sea of fire.

The plain was swept up by an amazing fire to the point that you couldn’t know where it started and ended.

“Uaaaaak!”

“Sa, save me!”

Inside of that, horrible yells were heard.

However, there wasn’t any change in the expression of the two men.

“If I knew before that there was a guy like that below me…..”

The clear eyed man smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

“That isn’t your fault. It’s the fault of troop commander Teise who wanted to steal the merits.”

“Abel. It was me that made someone like Teise a troop commander.”

At those words, the small eyed man Abel Glishi, shut up.

He looked at the man fixedly.

‘Corps commander Tereise.’

The clear eyed man was a viscount named Daniel Tereise, and he was responsible for the rearguard.

Daniel, who was also the commander of the 2nd corps of the western army of Istel, was quite calm and prudent and on top of that, didn’t know fear.

“Even so, he’s gets more amazing the more I think of it.”

Daniel was astounded with a surprising expression.

“It was also like that with the mysterious retreat tactic, and the surprise tactics and ambushes that tied up their feet and the several traps. For a mere 22 year old adjutant to think of all of this by himself……”

“It was also impressive that was defeated three or four times on purpose to bait them into the plains.”

“Right. Because of that, we could put them inside the sea of fire.”

At Abe’s words, Daniel nodded with a proud expression.

“He’s a real fox. A fox.”

Then, a blue light shined inside the sea of fire.

Abel’s light slightly rose.

“It seems like the grand shield was activated.”

At those words Daniel slowly nodded.

“Prepare the soldiers at the rearguard. We are annihilating the enemies that got out of the fire.”

“Yes!”

Abel replied in a loud voice and then fell back.

Daniel, who was left alone, looked at the plains that was swept up in fire and smiled faintly.

‘Friends of Rinse. Don’t chase us anymore. If you make a mistake then……’

His smile became denser.

‘You will be possessed by the fox.’

*****

They ran and kept running.

Faster than the wind.

‘Please, don’t let anything happen.’

For Roan, the 7th corps wasn’t simply the corps which he belonged in.

‘They’re nice people.’

Corps commander Aaron at the front with the commander of rose troop Gale, the adjutants Keniss, Dosen, Johnson, etc. and the several soldiers he roamed in the battlefield while he put his life on the line.

They were all good people.

They laughed, cried, got happy and angry together.

‘Expressing it in one way, they’re like family……….’

On top of that, the 7th corps was the starting point of this life.

It had a special meaning for Roan.

‘That’s why nothing bad has to have happened!’

He stuck his chest to the horse and kicked it.

Then, Roan’s expression stiffened.

‘Damn!’

Because of Kalian’s tear, he could see the entrance of the gorge that was far away like it was right in front of him.

There were many corpses.

‘It’s not the 7th corps.’

They would probably be of the 6th corps.

It seemed like they had received a surprise attack before they entered the gorge.

Roan kicked his horse once again.

Soon, the head of the horse entered the entrance of the gorge.

‘Mmm.’

The entrance was crueler than what he had thought.

He saw the hundreds of soldiers that became porcupines.

Most of them were soldiers of Istel.

Roan didn’t move around in the gorge hurriedly and used Kalian’s tear and to check his surroundings thoroughly.

He even checked the flow of mana.

‘There’s nothing.’

What he could see were only corpses.

Certainly, most of them are corpses of soldiers of Rinse.

“We are charging through.”

“Yes! Understood.”

The soldiers didn’t talk back.

They believed in Roan.

Roan and the 500 soldiers rode towards the gorge.

There were several arrows stuck into the sides of the mountain.

‘Did they pour the remaining things without any care?’

Roan ground his teeth.

He felt uneasiness increase the more time passed.

‘Just where is commander Tate…..’

Then, a really faint war cry was heard.

‘Maybe?’

Roan looked at the exit of the gorge fixedly.

When he used Kalian’s tear again.

‘Ah……’

A low exclamation came out.

‘It’s Rinse kingdom!’

Roan ground his teeth.

They were at the scenery that spread outside the gorge.

But there was a problem.

‘What an amazing fire!’

The plains was a sea of fire.

‘Damn. Was it also the fox of the battlefield?!’

Roan consecutively hit the horse.

Hiiiiiiiiing!

The horse brought up all the strength it had and charged forward.

Behind him, the 500 soldiers followed his back.

Dudududu.

Roan left the gorge first alongside the sound of horse clops.

At that instant, the huge plain was spread out in front of him.

Flaaaaaaame!

A hot wave came surging.

He could still feel it even when he was using Brent’s ring.

“Kugh!”

“Kuk!”

Followed by him, the normal soldiers that left the gorge ground their teeth at the amazing fire.

Everything he saw was a sea of fire.

The soldiers of Istel kingdom were inside that hell of a sea.

“Evacuate the soldiers to the gorge!”

“Ye, yes! Understood!”

The 500 soldiers endured the strong heat and moved inside the path of fire.

‘Fortunately, I can’t see any enemies.’

The fire was that strong and rough.

Roan sent his horse that was suffering back to the gorge and moved towards the fire.

Then.

“Troop commander! To, to the east!”

“Corps commander got caught at the front!”

The soldiers of the 7th corps yelled with all of their strength.

Roan hurriedly moved his sight to the east.

Kalian’s tear showed its might once again.

‘That’s? Grand shield?’

It was an unexpected situation.

A huge scaled magic barrier was taking place inside the path of fire.

“Ah!”

At that moment, a yell close to astonishment was heard.

“Corps commander! Troop commander!”

Aaron, Gale, and the other commanders were inside the grand shield.

But there was a problem.

‘Fox of the battlefield. You crazy bastard!’

There was an amazing path of fire surging inside the grand shield.

It was a situation that Aaron, Gale, and etc. couldn’t even dodge it as they were trapped inside of it.

Peid had used the defensive grand shield as a way of attack.

Tat!

Roan charged the ground.

As he pulled mana, an amazing energy overflowed.

The fire in his surroundings danced.

Pat!

As he inserted mana into Kalian’s tears, the whole world was dyed in golden light.

‘That’s the core!’

As the size of the grand shield wasn’t that big, the core was located in a place could be broken with a throw of the spear.

However.

“No!”

A scream came out of Roan’s mouth.

The moment he threw the spear.

The fire inside the grand shield covered Aaron, Gale, and etc.

Swaaaaaaa!

The spear split the air along with an amazing sound.

Chung!

The spear precisely pierced the core.

Chujujujug. Pung!

The grand shield broke alongside the loud sound.

Whoooosh!

The fire that was inside the grand shield exploded to the sides.

Roan executed the Flamdor mana technique and ran while piercing through the path of fire.

‘Kugh!’

As the fire touched his skin directly, he felt a disgusting pain.

Brent’s ring was also useless at this point.

However, he never stopped or fell back.

Waaak!

He arrived at the place the grand shield was taking place.

“Ah…..”

A hopeless look.

Roan moved his feet as if he was dragging it.

There were burnt corpses in the place the grand shield was.

There was nothing alive.

The place his sigh stayed.

Several people turned over themselves and were making a round shape.

Roan moved the corpses that were outside one by one.

“Kugh.”

Emotions overflowed.

His front was cloudy and something hot surged up.

Roan unconsciously clenched his fists.

The blackly burnt corpses that you couldn’t even recognize.

Even so, the corpses that were inside were maintaining their shape to some degree.

Then.

“Uhh…”

A weak groan was heard.

Roan opened his eyes wide.

The cloudy eyes found their focus again.

He carefully moved the corpses and in the quickest possible speed.

‘Ah! Adjutant Dosen, Adjutant Keniss……’

They were familiar faces.

They died while getting half burnt.

And a familiar back was seen below them.

“Troop commander Gale!”

Roan grabbed him carefully and turned him over.

“Uhh…”

A low exclamation came out of Gale’s mouth.

He was still alive.

Still.

“Troop commander Gale!”

Roan called out Gale’s name.

His face was half melted.

Gale breathed out roughly and barely opened one eye.

“It, it’s Roan.”

“Yes. I’m Roan. I have come!”

Roan wiped out the tears that came out and nodded.

Gale forced a smile.

“I saw you coming in from the outside of the grand shield.”

He kept moving his body.

“Corp, corps commander Tate?”

The reason he tried to turn his head.

He was curious about Aaron’s state, who he was covered up.

And fortunately, Aaron’s state wasn’t that bad.

His face and skin were slightly red, but it didn’t seem like he had any wounds.

Roan hurriedly extended his hand and he measured his pulse.

‘It’s beating.’

He was alive.

It was because Mendel, Gale, Keniss, and the adjutants had covered him.

They had sacrificed themselves and saved Aaron.

“He’s alive.”

“Ah……”

At Roan’s words, Gale let out a sigh of relief.

He extended his still fine right hand and caressed Roan’s face.

“Roan. It seems like I’m done.”

“Don’t say such things.”

Roan put on an angry face on purpose.

Gale shook his head.

“It’s a life that already should have been dead. But I could come up to here because of you.”

If it wasn’t for Roan, he would have already died at Ale gorge, Pedian’s plain, and Slen region.

“I, I wanted to see you soaring to the skies……Kugh.”

“Stop speaking. I will bring some soldiers.”

Gale extended his hand and grabbed Roan’s arm.

“Just, just stay by my side like this.”

Roan just grabbed Gale’s arm instead of replying.

A temperature hotter than the fire was transmitted.

“I lived without regrets……..”

Gale’s voice lowered.

And his roughly heaving chest also seemed to have found comfort.

It was a situation where he didn’t have much time left.

“There’s no death more suitable for a commander than dying in the battlefield.”

His mouth slightly rose up.

“Roan. Take care of Rose troop…..”

Those were his last words.

The light in his eyes had disappeared.

“Kugh.”

Roan extended his hands and closed Gale’s eyes.

He was dead.

He tried to save him but he couldn’t.

The mana that was spinning in his body moved roughly.

Flaaaaaame!

The flames that were gulping down the plain already moved near him.

‘Troop commander Gale, adjutant Keniss, adjutant Dosen…….’

And the several soldiers.

Everyone was dead.

“Uaaaaaaaaa!”

A loud scream came out.

A blood boiling rage exploded.

‘Monarch my ass! I can’t even protect my own people!’

Powerlessness and rage.

Following Roan’s emotions, the mana moved more roughly.

The flames in his surroundings danced towards him.

The hot wave entered his body through his nose, mouth, and skin.

The mana that lost it’s balance once was like a storm.

His entire body trembled.

The mana sucked in the heat and became larger

A disgusting pain filled him up.

Roan stood up and clenched his fists.

At that moment, the mana that was spinning roughly inside his body stopped like a lie.

“Kugh!”

His breath was cut off.

At that moment.

Bang!

The mana inside his body exploded.

At the same time, a red light emanated in Roan’s entire body.

The fire that was dancing, fell backwards.

“Uaaaaaa!”

Roan screamed at the feeling his body was breaking up.

Then.

The red light that was being emanated from his body started to get sucked in inside of his body.

Flaaaame!

The fire that was burning the plain covered Roan following the red light.

This was a situation of life and death.

The crimson flame started to get absorbed inside Roan’s body like a lie.

And that speed and strength was overwhelming.

Roan just stood still while he had his eyes closed.

An awkward and heavy silence fell.

Then.

Paat!

A red light emanated from Roan’s entire body.

At the same time, his hair grew to his waist.

The brown hair changed to become bright red.

And it was the same for his brows.

This was a strange phenomenon.

After a while, the red light returned to his body once again.

Only then did Roan open his eyes.

Open.

Even his eyes that were brown turned to become red.

He smiled coldly and turned his head.

Istel kingdom’s army was over there.

They were hiding themselves to annihilate the soldiers of Rinse kingdom that escaped the fire.

“Wh, just what’s this!”

Viscount Daniel staggered with a perplexed expression.

‘For, for a human to absorb fire!’

He had never heard or saw something like that.

Then, Daniel and Roan looked at each other.

Roan took out Travias spear from his waist.

Click! Cheng! Swuung!

The stick shaped Travias spear became long.

It had the shape of a perfect spear.

The long spear shone with a red light.

Roan looked at Istel’s army and closed his eyes.

“Kuuuuuuu.”

An unknown sound flowed out of his mouth.

And that resembled the cry of a beast.

Tat!

Roan charged the ground.

No, the moment they thought that.

He was soon in front of Istel kingdom’s army.

“Kuaaaaa!”

A strange sound came out of Roan’s mouth once again.

Chapter 78




2,000.

The number of Istel kingdom’s army was 2,000.

And among them, there were ten knights that knew how to use mana.

Because Rinse kingdom received a loss close to annihilation, the number of the force wasn’t bad by itself.

However, Daniel fell in a kind of despair the moment he saw the youth in front of him.

‘We are not his opponents.’

He was famous as a commander who didn’t know what fear was.

But this time was different.

He lost his breath at the nasty fear of Roan.

“Grrrrrrrr.”

The youth let out a cry that resembled a beast.

He had red hair, red eyebrows, and red eyes.

He was Roan.

“Kuaaaaaa!”

A cry exploded out.

Daniel stepped back and pulled his sword out.

“The knights are to face that bastard with me.”

He spoke in a calm voice.

“The normal soldiers are to escape without even looking back.”

“Corps commander!”

The soldiers yelled with a surprised expression.

“It’s an order! Flee!”

It was an order close to despair.

Daniel charged forward and ran towards Roan.

Abel and the knights followed his back.

‘A moment, if we can tie him up for a moment………’

When he thought up to there.

Paat!

Travias spear split the air.

Swush!

At the same time, the spear became larger than before.

“Hup!”

“Impossible!”

Daniel and the knights looked at the spear that became three or four times larger and ground their teeth.

They swung their respective weapons and tried to block Roan’s attack.

Cheeng!

A heavy sound of metal clashing was heard.

At the same time.

Boom! Booboom!

Daniel and the other knights were flung to the sides.

“Kugh.”

“Cough!”

They rolled on the ground.

“Kuhuhuhu!”

Roan laughed strangely and then charged the ground.

He arrived in front of the knights that were on the ground in an instant.

As he held the spear upside down, the long spear shrunk to the size of a long sword.

Stab.

The spear pierced the chest of the knight like that.

“Grr.”

The young knight couldn’t even fight back at all and died.

“Die!”

“Get him!”

Daniel and the other knights raised their intent.

Roan crushed the head of the dead knight with his right leg and lightly jumped.

Swush!

At that moment, the spear became larger.

Roan then jumped ino the air.

Daniel and the knights just blinked while having lost their objective.

‘That spear is maybe…….’

Daniel looked at the spear that changed length as it wished and frowned.

As he remembered, there was only one spear like that in the world.

‘Travias spear?’

Then, the enlarged spear shrank quickly again.

It became the size of a normal spear in an instant.

Roan twisted his body in the air and balanced himself.

It was a soft and fluent movement.

He arrived at the back of the knights.

The backs of the knights were exposed to Roan in an instant.

Roan instinctively swung his spear and tried to cut off their heads.

Strength was put behind the wrist and palm by its own.

When Travias spear was about to split the air again.

“Kuhk!”

Roan suddenly bent his back and let out a strange sound.

Because he felt a sickening pain inside his body.

“Kuuuuuu.”

A groan was heard.

The red color of his hair, eyebrows, and eyes became even more dense.

On top of that, even his skin started to turn red.

“Cough!”

Every time he coughed, flames appeared from his body and then disappeared.

Roan wasn’t normal right now.

The cause was that he had operated the Flamdor mana technique unreasonably to save his allies.

Meanwhile, the heat in the plain entered his body and the balance of his mana collapsed.

As he saw the 7th corps and rose troop getting massacred in front of his eyes, his emotions stirred.

In that really short instance, he lost control over his mana. But that short moment was the problem.

The mana started to overflow on its own.

And the overflowing of the mana made his emotions shake even more.

Thanks to that, the overflowing became more and more severe the more time passed.

In the end, Roan lost himself to the mana.

Now, there was no way to control the mana that was jumping everywhere.

If this state continued even a little bit more, the overflowing mana wouldn’t be able to bear it and then his body would explode or split apart.

“Cough!”

Small flames appeared as he coughed.

Daniel saw that and raised his sword high.

“This is the moment! Kill him right now!”

They realized that Roan’s body wasn’t normal.

Daniel and the knights ran towards Roan.

A blue light flowed along the sword.

“Die!”

The knights yelled with all their strength.

Right before the sword was about to tear up Roan.

“Kua!”

Roan swung his spear and let out a strange noise.

At that moment, his surroundings were set on fire.

Cheng! Checheng!

A clear sound of metal clashing rang out.

The knights couldn’t pierce through the path of fire.

“Press him down!”

However Daniel didn’t fall back.

He thought that this was the last opportunity to kill Roan.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

The sound of metal was heard continuously.

Sparks and fire appeared along the path of fire.

Spat!

Finally, Daniel’s swords sliced Roan’s wrist.

However, it was a really shallow wound.

“Kuaaaaaa!”

Roan let out a cry and held his spear.

Stab.

At that moment, the thickness of the spear became that of a wrist.

Woong. Woong. Woong.

A heavy sound sounded out.

Travias spear split the air.

Puk!

The knights were bounced off along with a loud sound.

“Kugh!”

Although they had raised their swords and blocked the blow, the strength behind the spear was too amazing.

Roan swung the huge spear as if it was nothing.

And every time he did that, the knights were flung to the sides.

At that moment.

“We will also help!”

A group of people appeared alongside the loud yell.

They were the veteran soldiers that had been with Daniel the longest.

Approximately 200 soldiers raised their weapons and appeared.

“I told you to retreat!”

Daniel yelled while swinging his sword.

The soldiers pushed back Roan without giving him any rest and replied in one voice.

“We are the rearguard army! Originally, the rearguard doesn’t have a life!”

This was their resolution they wouldn’t escape even if that meant death.

Daniel clicked his tongue.

“Stupid bastards.”

But he was quite proud and gratified.

‘I didn’t teach them wrongly anyways.’

He felt that strength was put into his limbs.

He yelled with strength.

“Fight with the resolution to die!”

“Yes! Understood!”

Anyways, the role of the rearguard army was to block the chasing of the enemy.

They just had to buy enough time for their allies to safely retreat.

‘Even if he seems to be a monster, a human is a human.’

He won’t be able to face all these soldiers and knights by himself.

No, even if that was possible, he would end up exhausted or get small and big wounds.

On top of that, Roan also wasn’t normal.

‘In the first place, we didn’t even hope for victory.’

Daniel was just planning to buy time.

That much was enough.

He charged the ground and ran towards Roan.

A blue light flowed along the sword.

Although it was faint and didn’t have a good shape, the strength of it was felt clearly.

Cheng!

Roan’s spear clashed with Daniel’s sword.

Below him, the other knights swung their swords.

Roan turned his body and swung his spear.

Cheng! Chencheng! Cheng!

Sparks appeared along with with the sound of metal.

Every time he turned his body, a red light appeared in his spear.

However, it was unreasonable to look at that as mana.

The red light became even more dense and it transformed to become a path of fire in the end.

Travias spear became a line of fire from the blade to its body.

“Damn! Is it fire again?!”

Daniel yelled and flung his body backwards.

And the other knights also did the same.

In an instant, only Roan was left alone.

Above that, the arrows the rearguard army fired poured down.

“Kuaaaaa!”

Roan let out a cry and spun his spear above his head.

No, he spun the line of fire.

Pubububung!

The rain of arrows exploded the instant it touched the line of fire.

“Keep firing! Keep firing!”

Abel yelled as if he had fallen in despair.

The archers fired arrows without stop.

However, not one of the archers could pierce through Roan’s spear wall.

Then, Roan lightly rolled his foot and got in between the soldiers.

The spear that caught fire split the air and attacked.

“Monster like bastard!”

Daniel, who had fallen back, attacked while resolving himself to die again.

Cheng! Checheng!

However, their attacks were too easily blocked.

Roan fended off all of their swords with his spear and then swung it once more.

“Uaaaaak!”

“Kuk!”

The limbs of the knights were cut off cleanly.

The spear kept moving flexibly and then attacked Daniel’s neck.

At that moment.

“Cough!”

Roan coughed with a painful expression.

He wriggled for a moment and then threw his spear away.

“Kuaaa!”

A scream mixed with pain.

An amazing fire surged up from all over his body.

“Die!”

Daniel and Abel brought all their last strength and stabbed him.

The moment the swords were about to touch Roan’s body.

‘Kug!’

An amazing repulsive force was felt at the tip of his hands.

Bang!

The path of fire exploded along with a loud sound.

“Kuhuk!”

Daniel and Abel couldn’t endure it and were bounced off.

Their swords were half melted and there were flames on their elbows and shoulders.

“Damn it!”

Daniel and Abel fell back and after putting out the fire, they looked at Roan.

“Kuaaaa!”

Roan was still struggling while screaming.

The fire that emanated out of his body made a huge pillar of fire.

‘There’s nothing we can do.’

Daniel clenched his fists.

Even the sword with mana behind it was useless.

He made eye signs to Abel and started to slowly fall back.

“We are retreating.”

The short order was sent to the soldiers.

The soldiers just nodded without saying anything.

They started to step back really slowly.

And fortunately, Roan didn’t show interest in them.

No, he wasn’t able to.

“Kuaak!”

Because the mana that was overflowing in his body had started to reach the peak.

‘It seems like the mana is overflowing…….’

Daniel looked at the pillar of fire emanating out of Roan’s body.

‘It would be good if he died like this.’

Those were his honest feelings

For a monster like that to exist in Rinse kingdom was a horrible thing and a disastrous devil for Istel kingdom.

When the rearguard army was getting farther from Roan, contrary to them, the 2nd rose troop was running towards Roan.

“Troop commander Roan!”

They also saw Roan absorbing fire.

And of course, the look of his hair growing and turning red.

They felt awe at the look of battling the rearguard alone.

However, they realized that Roan’s situation wasn’t normal quite late.

‘We are saving the troop commander ourselves!’

When the 2nd rose troop moved quite close to Roan.

“Kuhok!”

Roan’s screams stopped.

At the same time, the fire pillar that was burning fiercely died off.

‘Di, did it turn fine?’

Austin looked at Roan with uneasy eyes.

Then, wind blew at his back.

But it wasn’t the west wind.

‘This?’

Austin and the soldiers opened their eyes abruptly.

Swaaaaaa!

The wind blew towards Roan.

‘Kuk! Dangerous.’

Austin realized that something wasn’t right.

He made a sign towards the 2nd rose troop.

They laid down on the ground as if they had practiced it.

At that moment.

Baaaaaang!

A huge explosion occurred with an amazing sound.

The wind that was blowing towards Roan started to spread towards the sides again.

Alongside that came the huge fire.

“Kugh!”

“Don’t raise your heads!”

The members of the 2nd rose troop buried their faces onto the ground.

And fortunately, the fire surged over the ground.

“Kuaaaaa!”

Roan cried out one more time.

He was burning his mana currently.

No, precisely speaking, he was sucking the heat scattered in the atmosphere and burning the mana above his abilities.

Because of that, the mana hole and the mana road inside his body ripped and regenerated, and repeated doing that.

If this continued, it was obvious that his entire body would explode.

But there was nothing that could be done.

Roan had lost his sanity and there was no method in which others could approach him.

At least, there was nothing a human could do.

Then.

Spat!

The fiercely burning fire was split up.

And among that split space, a beautiful woman appeared.

She had blue hair and really transparent skin.

She, who was wearing a sky dress, was barefoot but that was meaningless.

Because she was floating in the air just like a cloud.

“In the end, you became like this.”

She had a beautiful voice.

She was the woman that was looking at Roan inside Biate’s place.

“Although I don’t like you, I can’t go against Biate’s will.”

The woman approached Roan who was covered in fire and shook her hand.

At that moment, a huge orb of a blue light covered her and Roan.

The fire that was spreading out was caught inside that orb.

“The one who has my tear.”

The expression of the woman was kind of stifled.

She softly covered Roan’s cheeks with her hands.

The red flame escaped her hands and fled.

The woman whispered with a clear and pretty voice.

“I, the water elemental king Ellaim, have come to rescue you.”

Chapter 79




Sponsored chapter

Ellaim returned to the resting place again after Biate died in Poskein lake.

It was because of Biate’s will.

The one that enters my place and who fate has touched. Protect that person for me.

Ellaim waited for 50 years to fulfill her will.

And if the one that entered the resting place was someone capable to follow Biate’s back, she was planning to make a contract and lead him to the lake.

Because the last piece Biate left was over there.

But maybe it was fate playing with her, or a god teasing her, but the one that entered Biate’s place was learning Reid’s mana technique.

The mana technique of the enemy that killed Biate.

If that guy hadn’t absorbed her tear, and if it wasn’t for Biate’s last will, Ellaim would have returned to the elemental world.

‘Although it’s displeasing and uncomfortable, this may also be fate.’

Ellaim fulfilled Biate’s will.

She watched the guy from a close place.

And on top of that, she had even wanted to help when his life was in danger.

But the guy overcame the difficulties by himself.

‘But of course, being able to overcome that danger was also because of my tear.’

The overflowing of the Flamdor mana technique.

Every dangerous time, Ellaim’s tear calmed down the overflowing mana.

‘But this time it’s different.’

Even before Ellaim’s tear could show its strength, the heat in his body and the surrounding heat were mixed together and repeated exploding and overflowing.

It was a situation where you wouldn’t be able to endure it with the body of a human.

If this situation continued a little bit more, it was obvious that his entire body would explode or tear apart and die.

‘I also thought about letting him die like this……..’

But she didn’t want to end Biate’s last wish like that.

On top of that.

‘Excluding that he’s learning the Flamdor mana technique, he’s quite a fine guy.’

The results of having looked after him until now was that he was a human worth saving.

Ellaim showed her hidden body like that.

She poured the essence of water over Roan’s head.

But it wasn’t at the level of what humans absorbed and felt.

It was the best of the best.

It was the cleanest and most perfect essence of water.

Swuuuush.

The fire that was emanating from Roan’s body shook roughly.

It was resisting against Ellaim’s water.

‘The Flamdor mana technique wasn’t made by a human.’

Ellaim shook her head at the rough repulsive force she felt at the tip of her hands.

Even she didn’t know the exact identity of the Flamdor mana technique.

Only, she couldn’t think that a mana technique was so strong that it was able to oppose the strength of a spirit king was made by a human.

‘It’s a disgustingly rough and strong force.’

Ellaim’s face stiffened.

‘Even Reid was eaten up by this strength.’

The deeper the achievements in the mana technique, the deeper his temperament would become more explosive and urgent.

The reason he came to find Biate all the way in her cave, regardless of her denial, was also because of this.

Ellaim looked at Roan’s face.

‘My strength and the strength of my tear will calm down your Flamdor mana technique.’

Just looking at the growth speed of the technique, the speed could be a bit slower.

However, the heat inside his body wouldn’t overflow as it wished or made him lose his nature.

‘On top of that, if you discover the mystery Reid and Biate realized before they died, you would be able to attain an unimaginable strength.’

Even Ellaim couldn’t imagine that strength.

Because she only controlled one force, the essence of water.

‘One more reason has been added to look after him.’

Ellaim bent her fingers and brought up more essence of water.

Frrrr!

The fire that was emanating out of Roan’s body resisted roughly one more time.

However, as the understanding of the technique was still shallow, it was still too early to beat the strength of an elemental king.

The fire died down even more.

Swuuush.

The fire that was caught in the blue orb was absorbed inside of Roan’s body.

The flames that were moving around his body roughly found stability and then returned to the mana hole.

Even the red features returned to the original looks.

‘Because an overwhelming amount of mana overflowed, the mana hole and the mana road became bigger and more solid.’

From misfortune to a blessing.

Ellaim smiled bitterly and clenched her fists tightly.

As she had calmed down the fire, only her tear and the essence remained now.

After Ellaim woke up the strength of the tear, she mixed it up with the essence of water.

Paat!

Roan’s body was filled with the essence of water in an instant.

Ellaim gathered the essence around him and covered Roan’s mana hole gently.

Just as if she covered it with a thin cloth.

‘If I do this, even if the fire essence explodes, it won’t come out of the mana hole.’

Ellaim let out a long sigh and took off her hands slowly.

Roan’s face seemed much more comfortable now.

Ellaim looked at that face for a moment and then pressed on Roan’s forehead with her index finger.

She planted what had just happened inside Roan’s memories.

It still wasn’t time for them to meet and converse yet.

“I hope you don’t disappoint Biate……..”

Ellaim’s voice softly flowed out.

Swush.

The blue orb disappeared.

At the same time, Ellaim also disappeared.

Tuk.

Roan slowly fell.

Just as if he was asleep.

“Troop commander!”

The soldiers of the 2nd rose troop yelled in one voice.

Ellaim’s appearance and retreat happened in just an instant.

Because of that, in the eyes of the soldiers, it was seen as if a blue orb shined for an instant and then the fire disappeared.

“Troop commander Roan!”

The soldiers ran towards Roan with weird looks.

‘What was that just now?’

‘I feel like there was someone over there.’

As it was a really short instant, they couldn’t even see Ellaim properly.

Austin and the soldiers kneeled down around Roan.

Roan was lying down like a dead rat.

Gulp.

Everyone looked at him with nervous looks.

Then.

Blink.

Roan abruptly opened his eyes and sat up with his upper body.

“Huhuk!”

The soldiers were surprised and gulped in air.

However, they got happy at the truth that Roan was alive and yelled.

“Troop commander! Are you okay?”

“You aren’t hurt?”

They had expressions filled with worry.

And extravagant voices.

But even so, Roan still had an absent minded expression. His eyes had lost focus.

He was concentrating on the voice Ellaim had left inside his head.

‘So that silver water drop was Ellaim’s tear.’

At this moment, the identity of the coldness inside his body was revealed.

‘Although the growth speed of the mana technique slowed down, it became stable.’

On top of it all.

‘If I can awaken the mysteries…….’

He may be able to attain a strength he couldn’t even imagine.

Roan took in a deep breath.

“Troop commander!”

“Can you hear my voice?”

The soldiers yelled even louder when they saw that Roan didn’t show any reactions.

Olly then did Roan brightly smile and look at everyone’s faces.

“I’m fine.”

At that moment, a smile blossomed on the worried faces of the soldiers.

“Ah! How great! What a relief!”

They let out a long sigh.

Roan tried to stand up.

Then.

Boom.

The body rose as if it was flicking and then fell forward.

“Troop commander!”

The soldiers supported Roan with surprised looks.

Roan had a confused expression.

‘My body feels light.’

It wasn’t that he was full of vitality.

He had a feeling that his muscles and strength improved to become much better..

Roan stood up with the help of the soldiers.

“Are you really okay?”

Austin asked carefully.

Roan nodded and moved his body everywhere.

‘This feels just like I was reborn again.’

A feeling like he just took off heavy armor.

Roan realized what kind of situation he was in.

‘As the mana overflowed, the impurities in my body were removed, and the muscles and bones became stronger.’

He had vaguely heard that there were cases like that when the understanding of the technique deepened.

But of course, in Roan’s case, it wasn’t that his understanding deepened but it was because of the overflowing.

‘Is it a blessing from a misfortune.’

Roan bitterly smiled and moved.

As he got a hold of himself, what he had to do now was to care of Aaron.

And fortunately, as Aaron was lying flat on the ground, he didn’t receive any injuries from Roan’s explosion.

“Corps commander.”

Roan carefully shook Aaron and woke him up.

“Mmm.”

A shallow groan came out of his mouth.

Aaron’s eyes shook.

He frowned and then slowly opened his eyes.

Soon, the soldiers that survived gathered around him.

“Mmm. It’s Roan.”

A weak voice.

Aaron flinched his shoulders as if he was trying to raise his upper body.

Roan extended his two hands and received him.

“Thank you.”

Aaron bitterly smiled and raised his upper body.

Only then could he see the scenery.

The burnt plains and the black smoke.

The corpses that were scattered in the surroundings.

‘Right. We fell into the trap of the Istel bastards.’

Aaron frowned.

His head hurt as if it would split.

The chasing army composed by the 6th and 7th corps quickly chased down the main army of Istel.

Although Aaron actually didn’t like the idea of chasing, as it was an order of Benjamin he couldn’t do anything about it.

Only, as the war had ended in their victory, he would just pretend to chase them.

However.

‘The rearguard army that we actually faced wasn’t really that much.’

They suffered defeat and retreated consecutively.

‘I felt that something was fishy……..’

Even before that, it was the rearguard that has given a big blow to the eastern army through perfect traps, surprise attacks, and ambushes.

But for that kind of rearguard to suffer consecutive defeats without any reasons was quite a suspicious situation.

Aaron wanted to stop the chase by then.

However, the thought of the commander of the 6th corps was different.

Rather, he brought up the morale and went off to chase and annihilate them perfectly.

In the end Aaron hid his fishy feeling and could only chase his back.

‘In that situation, the 6th corps that were in front fell in an ambush………’

Aaron and the 7th corps could only charge forward to rescue them.

‘And in the end, we fell into a trap.’

Aaron clenched his fists.

‘The 6th corps commander died as soon as he fell into the trap.’

He felt bitter.

Because of a useless commander, several soldiers lost their lives.

He took in a deep breath and looked at Roan.

“Roan. What happened with the other commanders that were with me?”

He had plentifully guessed what could have happened.

But he could only ask just in case.

Roan took in a breath and then replied in a calm voice.

“They have all died.”

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out of Aaron’s mouth.

The moment they were trapped in the grand shield, Gale, Mendel, the troop commanders, and the adjutants ran towards him.

They covered him without any empty spaces from the fire.

The last words Gale left him rang in his head.

Corps commander. Be sure to stay alive and lead the other soldiers.

Aaron shook his head.

“Right. So they have all died…..”

His voice was wet.

Something hot surged in his eyes.

“I’m the only one alive. This useless piece of body survived………”

These were eords as if he was rebuking himself.

Roan and the others couldn’t say anything while they lowered their heads.

“Whew.”

Aaron let out a long sigh and started to shed hot tears.

But those weren’t tears shed by a corps commander.

They were tears shed by a fellow comrade.

“I’ve lost good allies, excellent friends.”

Aaron raised his head and looked at Roan and the soldiers.

“We are gathering the corpses of the fellow soldiers. We won’t leave this place until it’s perfectly gathered.”

The chase was meaningless now.

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan and the others replied in a hot voice.

They slowly got up and moved.

It was to gather the corpses of their comrades prudently.

Roan first supported Aaron.

As his body still wasn’t normal, he needed some rest.

The sound of a horn trumpet was heard at the side of the gorge.

Puuuuuuu!

Roan stopped his feet and looked towards the gorge.

At that moment, a displeased look appeared in his face.

‘Benjamin.’

The ones that appeared with the horn trumpet was the main army of the eastern territory.

They slowly crossed over the plains and then fell after they got on their formations.

After a while, they split to the sides and Benjamin appeared with several corps commanders.

“Commander Tate.”

Benjamín rode his horse and slowly approached.

His expression was quite stifled.

Happiness, anger, and annoyance.

There were all of those emotions in his expression.

“Just what is this look?”

A reprimanding sound.

‘They fell in the trap just like I thought.’

Benjamin yelled for delight.

‘I have to ask his responsibility.’

He was planning to cut off the accumulated merits of the 7th corps.

Aaron fixed his posture and bowed deeply.

“While we were chasing the army of Istel, the 6th corps fell in the trap set up by the enem……..”

When he talked up to there.

“Stop! Are you accusing the 6th corps right now! Who did I give the commanding rights to?”

At the rebuking sound, Aaron hesitated and then replied.

“Me.”

“Right. I gave the commanding rights to Aaron Tate of the 7th corps and not to the 6th corps. Then, whose fault is it that the 6th corps fell in a trap and your troop suffered a blow close to annihilation?”

“That…..”

Aaron couldn’t reply.

Looking at it this way, it was his fault as he was leading the chasing troop.

However.

‘The commander of the 6th corps didn’t listen to my order.’

The one that didn’t obey the orders was the commander of the 6th corps.

Because of that, even the 7th corps suffered a blow close to annihilation.

As Aaron couldn’t reply, Benjamin asked in a voice that had mockery mixed in it.

“Why can’t you speak? Whose fault is it?”

In the end, Aaron replied in a suffering voice.

“It’s mine.”

He couldn’t endure it and shook his head.

Roan, who was observing at the sides, clenched his fists tightly.

‘Benjamin!’

He knew that he was a selfish and powerless bastard.

And even knew that he didn’t like the 7th corps.

But he didn’t know that he would step out this obstinately.

His entire body trembled.

Then, Aaron grabbed Roan’s hand.

‘It’s fine.’

Eyes implying that.

Roan forcefully breathed in and calmed down his emotions.

“On top of that, what’s this situation?”

Benjamin pointed at the plains.

The soldiers gathering the corpses of the allies.

Aaron replied in a calm voice.

“We are gathering the corpses of the comrades that died in this battle.”

“Corpse gathering? Tch!”

Benjamin frowned and clicked his tongue.

He was planning to keep pushing Aaron to a corner.

“I think I certainly laid the order to chase the enemy army and annihilate them?”

“However, our losses were quite severe, and I judged as keeping the chase was meaningle…..”

“Stop!”

Benjamin shouted.

A stiff expression.

His voice lowered down coldly.

“Judge? The judging is done by me and not you. You just have to follow my orders!”

Aaron clenched his fists.

He wanted to talk back immediately, but he couldn’t do so.

They were still at war, and the place they were standing at was a battlefield.

Not obeying to the orders meant that you were committing a sin that could lead to punishments according to the situation.

‘Come on. Come with all the excuses and bark at me.’

Benjamin opened his eyes thinly and glared at Aaron.

He waited for Aaron to talk back.

‘I will confine you immediately.’

It was a tactic to make him be able in setting certain punishment perfectly.

However, Aaron endured it better than he thought.

Benjamin smacked his lips and sent another order.

“Stop the gathering of the corpses immediately and chase the enemy army.”

“Commander.”

Aaron looked at Benjamin fixedly.

Eyes implying to change the order.

However there were no changes in Benjamin’s thoughts.

“Tch. We can’t waste time for the ones that died stupidly.”

He looked at Aaron fixedly and continued saying.

“Are you maybe not able to follow my orders?”

This was a perfect threat.

But funnily, his expression and eyes was filled with a feeling for him not to follow his orders.

‘Benjamin……’

Aaron ground his teeth.

If he only wasn’t a corps commander, he would already have charged into Benjamin.

However.

‘If I do that here, I will also put my underlings in a bad situation.’

If it was Benjamin, he was someone that wouldn’t be enough with that.

In the end Aaron chose to bow.

“Yes. I will follow your…….”

When he talked up to there.

Roan, that was looking at the situation by the sides, took one step forward.

“Commander.”

They were fierce eyes and a cold voice.

Roan looked at Benjamin’s two eyes fixedly.

“We can’t follow that order.”

“What did you say just now?”

Benjamin frowned.

He put on an expression to show that he was displeased and angry.

However, there was delight in his two eyes.

‘Done. I will have to get rid of this thorn first.’

He knew that most of the merits done by the 7th corps were thanks to Roan.

‘If I can’t have him then it would be better to break him.’

He opened his two eyes abruptly and put on a threatening expression.

However, Roan was quite calm and composed.

“I can’t follow your orders in chasing the enemy’s army.”

A look without getting dispersed.

He continued saying with a calm voice.

“Our chasing troop suffered a blow close to annihilation. On top of that, we are already near enemy’s boundary. If we chase them now, it’s difficult to give them a big blow.”

It was quite a reasonable and appropriate words.

Aaron and some commanders nodded and then looked at Benjamin and cleared their throats.

“Thi, thi, this…….”

Benjamin’s face became red.

Roan stared at Benjamin for a moment and then turned to look at the 7th corps.

And naturally, the sight of everyone followed Roan’s.

“Mmm.”

Some commanders and staff officers exclaimed.

The 7th corps wasn’t in their normal state.

They were barely alive but the soldiers that suffered severe injuries, the suffering soldiers that were looking at their deceased comrades, soldiers screaming for having their limbs cut off, etc.

Roan looked at the soldiers and got a firm resolution.

‘I will at least save them.’

He turned to look at Benjamin again.

“There’s no commander that lays an order to a corps that’s close to annihilation to keep chasing. Lay down your order.”

An earnest voice.

Some soldiers started to tremble.

‘If I make a mistake, the atmosphere will change.’

Benjamin felt urgent.

He opened his eyes abruptly and yelled.

“You! You dare to disobey the orders of a superior!”

The atmosphere turned serious.

Roan clenched his fists

He felt so stifled as if there was a rock on his chest.

The fire essence in his mana hole twitched and roamed in his body.

Roan looked at Benjamin fixedly.

“Commander. It’s not disobeying.”

“Shut up!”

Benjamin yelled with a red face.

In the end, even Roan couldn’t hold it anymore.

“Commander!”

A voice that could shake the mountain.

The mana that was inside his body exploded outside his body through his voice.

An amazing spirit emanated with Roan at the center.

Hiiiiiiiing!

The war horses burbled and the commanders and soldiers had surprised expressions.

“Thi, what is…..”

Benjamin even staggered because he became really surprised.

‘This bastard even knew how to use mana?’

His face turned pale and his eyes trembled.

Roan looked at that Benjamin fixedly and slowly moved his feet.

Gulp.

Everyone gulped dry saliva and looked at that scene.

Roan stood in front of Benjamin and continued saying in a calm voice.

“Lay down a proper order. The war has ended. Commander.”

“……”

Silence fell in an instant.

It was a silence that clogged your breath.

Even when there were tens of thousands of soldiers, you couldn’t even hear a breath.

‘Da, damn it!’

Benjamin got a hold of himself late.

‘I’m the commander of the eastern region! I’m the superior in the eastern region!’

He looked at Roan fixedly.

“Impudent bastard!”

He barely managed to yell.

“All the judgements and decisions are done by me. You just have to follow my orders!”

He continued saying.

“The 7th corps will continue to chase the enemy’s army. That’s my decision and order.”

Benjamin didn’t back down.

Roan shook his head.

“Commander. Can you……”

“Shut up!”

Benjamin yelled with all his strength.

In the first place, he didn’t think of holding a normal conversation.

‘Benjamin…….’

Roan ground his teeth.

‘My past life also got messed up because of you.’

But even this life was getting messed up by him.

He wanted to kick him in the chin once.

But he couldn’t.

He was a noble with the title of Viscount and the commander representing the eastern region.

He wasn’t someone a normal person, and a mere troop commander at that, could do something.

‘If I face him, I may get imprisoned or get exiled, to say nothing of becoming a monarch.’

Because of that, he endured the nonsense orders and kept enduring.

“Hmph! If you continue not wanting to follow my orders….”

Benjamin snorted lightly and shook his right hand.

Five staff officers that were behind him came running quickly.

They were the closest people Benjamin had and they all knew how to use mana.

“Arrest Roan and detain him in the rear of the camp. When the war ends, I will clearly name your sins and lay down a punishment.”

The order has been laid down.

Benjamin planned to overthrow the thorn like Roan in this opportunity.

‘Next is Aaron.’

His forehead got carved.

“Yes. Understood.”

The officers replied in one voice and moved.

Then.

“You can’t do that!”

The soldiers of the 2nd rose troop that were behind Roan blocked them.

“Huh?”

“Uh?”

Benjamin, Aaron, and even Roan had surprised expressions.

Austin, who was at the forefront of the soldiers, looked at Benjamin fixedly.

“You can’t take away troop commander Roan!”

Followed by him, the other soldiers added.

“That’s right!”

“It’s unfair treatment!”

Roan raised up the clearest merits in the war against Istel kingdom, and more than anyone else.

On top of that, disobeying Benjamin’s order this time was because that order was just too unreasonable.

As the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop saw it, Roan didn’t make any mistakes.

‘He must be jealous of troop commander’s merits!’

‘Benjamin Doyle is originally this kind of person!’

The soldiers clenched their fists.

Their hard resolution, that they wouldn’t step back at all, was felt.

‘If troop commander Roan gets imprisoned…….’

‘Doyle commander will lay down an unreasonable punishment.’

In the first place, it was important to prevent him from incarcerating Roan.

Austin bent towards Benjamin.

“Troop commander Roan has raised outstanding merits in several battles. Take that into account.”

“Hmph!”

Benjamin immediately snorted.

“Impudent things. It’s not a problem mere soldiers can butt in!”

He looked at Roan and the soldiers alternatingly and shook his head.

“That commander and his underlings. Tch tch tch.”

The sound of clicking his tongue was heard clearly.

Roan looked at the soldiers blocking his front.

“You fall back.”

At those words, the soldiers shook their heads.

“We can’t do that. We will stay next to you until the very end.”

“We can’t send you off like this!”

The tension rose up.

Then, Benjamin’s voice was heard.

“What are you doing! Are you just going to watch?!”

At those words, the officers that were standing confused started to move again.

“No, no!”

Austin and the soldiers blocked them once again.

“Fuck off!”

The officers didn’t endure it anymore.

The officer that was standing at the front swung his fist towards Austin.

And it even had mana behind it.

“Kugh!”

Austin ground his teeth when he looked at the fist swinging at him.

Then.

Tuk!

One hand appeared abruptly and lightly blocked the flying fist.

“Ugh.”

The staff that swung the fist ground his teeth.

But the fist didn’t move an inch.

“A fist that has mana behind it for a normal soldier. Don’t you think that’s too much?”

The person that blocked the officer’s fist.

He was none other than Roan.

‘Wh, what kind of strength is this……’

The officer became perplexed.

Roan pulled up mana and put strength in his hand.

Uduk.

The tips of the fingers carved in the fist of the officer.

“Uhhhhhhhhh.”

The officer groaned with a painful expression.

“This son of a bitch!”

“Let go!”

The other officers yelled and approached.

They suddenly swung their fists.

Fists that also had mana behind it.

‘In the end it turns out like this.’

Roan let out a short sight and slightly fell back.

At the same time, the fist of the officer he was holding onto was pulled towards his chest.

“Huh?!”

The guy lost balance and was pulled forward.

The fists and kicks of the other officers fell onto his body.

Pubuk! Puk!

“Kugh!”

A heavy hitting sound was heard with the groan.

Roan let go of the fist as if he threw it and charged forward.

“Uh?!”

“Hup!

When the four officers were surprised and fell backwards.

Pabat!

Roan’s two fists split the air.

The attack was so fast you could only see the remnants of it.

Pububuk! Puk!

The fists landed on their faces and stomachs.

“Grr.”

They couldn’t even fight back once and collapsed.

Roan raised his head to look at Benjamin.

Casual eyes.

Benjamin trembled unconsciously.

‘Damn. I, I am afraid!?’

Humiliation surged up.

Then, Roan lightly kicked.

Pubuk!

The officers that were kneeling down on the ground were hit on their chins and fell like that.

They had perfectly passed out looks.

Roan let out a long sigh.

He wanted to endure it until the end.

There were plenty of methods to get out even if he was imprisoned.

In the worst of the cases, he was even thinking of leaving the army.

‘But I can’t endure looking my troop members suffering at all.’

He couldn’t stand watching his subordinates get hit because of something personal.

Roan looked at Benjamin fixedly.

“I will go to the rear of the camp as you wish. Instead, spare the fault of my troop members.”

Benjamin just blinked at the sudden situation.

“Roan!”

“Troop commander!”

Aaron and the troop members yelled with a surprised expression.

However, Roan’s expression was still calm.

‘There are plenty of methods to pull down that bastard to the bottom.’

Even if he didn’t do so, he was gathering information through Chris’s agency.

But for now, protecting his troop members came first.

Then, Aaron butted in.

“No, if it’s responsibility we are talking about, I the corps commander…..”

But he couldn’t continue speaking.

“Commander.”

Roan interrupted him and whispered in his ear with a really low voice.

“Are you going to make the deaths of the several troop commanders and adjutants to become useless? You should remain here and lead the soldiers.”

“Roan…..”

The end of Aaron’s words dimmed.

Why wouldn’t he understand Roan’s words?

“If you start chasing, don’t chase them hurriedly but only pretend to do so.”

Roan smiled faintly and then looked at Austin and the soldiers.

“You too, fall back.”

“Troop commander……”

The troop members all clenched their fists and trembled.

They had expressions that they couldn’t endure it because they were angry and felt that it was unfair.

Roan and the troop members exchanged gazes.

‘Everyone, don’t worry.’

Roan was confident.

He wanted to dig a deeper hole and lead Benjamin over there.

‘I will bury you so deep you won’t be able to get out.’

Backing down once for the future.

Roan raised his head and looked at Benjamin.

Benjamin just smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

‘It would have been good if I also got Aaron mixed up in it……’

The opportunity just now was regretful.

He looked at Roan and nodded.

“Good. I will do as you wish.”

There was no need to imprison or arrest a normal soldier.

He only needed Aaron and Roan.

Right before he finished speaking, some soldiers approached.

Roan saluted shortly towards Aaron.

“I will see you later.”

“I have no honor.”

Aaron lowered his face.

Roan forced a smile and walked.

The soldiers of the 2nd rose troop looked at him with stifled expressions.

Then, Benjamin’s voice was heard.

He looked at the surrounding battlefield and let out a sigh.

“Whew. Anyways, this is really a mess. They got charred black. Tch tch tch.”

Benjamin clicked his tongue in a big way and continued saying.

“This is what they call a dog’s death. Because you only do what you are ordered to without thinking ahead, you die in such a way. If you are a person you have to know to think by yourself and lay your own judgements. Tch.”

He spitted out and sent down an order towards the officers.

“Take care of the corpses roughly. We lack time to gather them all and….”

A fishy smile appeared on his face.

“They aren’t worth it.”

It was a voice filled with mockery.

At that moment, Aaron’s and the soldier’s expressions stiffened.

Their entire body trembled.

They wanted to cleanly pour out curses.

‘If we make a fuss over here, Roan’s look will become funny.’

‘Troop commander Roan chose to get imprisoned for us. We have to endure it.’

Aaron and the soldiers clenched their fists.

They gulped down the surging rage for of Roan.

Then.

Paat!

Something appeared in front of Benjamin.

“Huh?!”

Everyone opened their eyes roundly and put surprised expressions.

But of course, the most surprised one was Benjamin.

“Kuk!”

A feeling his breath got cut off.

He looked at the guy that was grabbing his throat.

“Ro, kugh. Ro, Roa. Just what is……….Kugh.”

It was difficult to even speak.

“Co, commander!”

“You crazy bastard!”

The surrounding officers and commanders opened their eyes abruptly and approached.

Roan grabbed Travias spear with his left hand while still grabbing on Benjamin’s throat with his right hand.

Cheng!

The hidden blade of the spear showed itself.

At the same time.

Swush.

The spear became longer and then was stuck in front of the feet of the officers and commanders that were approaching.

Puk!

The ground was dug into and rocks scattered with a loud sound.

Roan said in a cold voice while not even looking at them.

“Until there. The moment you cross that, I will take Benjamin Doyle’s life.”

“Kughhhh.”

Benjamin struggled as if the strength behind the grip was painful.

At that look, the officers and commanders couldn’t approach anymore and fell back.

Roan looked at Benjamin’s eyes properly.

“Benjamin.”

There were no honorifics anymore.

“It’s fine if you lay an unreasonable order. And it’s fine if you badmouth me. I can endure everything else. But…….” His voice lowered.

“I can’t endure you mocking the deaths of my deceased comrades at all.”

Roan ground his teeth.

He tried to endure it but in the end, he couldn’t.

‘I can’t turn back anymore.’

He took in a deep breath.

‘Now that I started it, let’s pull the roots.’

He got resolved.

‘I was wondering whether I had to stay in the 7th corps after the war ends or leave……..’

Thanks to Benjamin, he could stop doing so.

‘Let’s leave. I’m leaving after I clear things up cleanly.’

Roan inserted mana in his fists.

A look that he would send his chin flying at any moment.

Then.

Sounds of the jing, drums, and horn trumpets were heard far away from the gorge.

Roan saw through the smoke and looked towards the entrance.

He could see a huge flag with a flashy symbol.

The symbol in the flag was familiar.

He let out a long sigh.

He smacked his lips and a really low voice flowed out.

“Count Lancephil……”

Chapter 81




“Kugh. Le, let this go. Kugh.”

Benjamin smiled fishily and rolled his eyes.

‘However angry you may be, you won’t be able to do anything to me.’

He was a noble and a supreme commander at that.

On top of that, even Count Lancephil showed himself.

One slip up and this problem could become bigger.

“Kugh. Can’t you let this go!”

The tension rose even higher.

But Roan just looked at Benjamin fixedly.

“Do you think I won’t be able to hit you?”

He put more strength in his grip.

“Kugh.”

His breath got cut off.

‘Actually, it is something unreasonable.’

Roan put on a bitter smile.

This was an exhibition.

Resorting to violence to a superior, and a noble at that was something unimaginable.

It was a sin that could get you executed on the spot.

But regardless of that, Roan wasn’t planning on leaving Benjamin like that.

‘It’s been revealed that I am learning mana.’

There was no way that they would execute a soldier that knew how to use mana.

Someone at the level of a knight was quite important even at the center of the kingdom.

He may receive some punishment, but he would be safe from execution.

On top of that, if Roan only evaded the execution, he had plenty of ways to deal with the following problems.

‘And also, no use crying over spilled milk.’

Grabbing the throat of a superior was already a big thing.

And it wouldn’t change if he hit him several times right now.

‘Now that I started, I have to clearly end it.’

He did his best in what he had already started.

That was Roan’s temperament.

Because of that, he could remain as an ordinary spearman for the army for 20 years.

Udk.

Strength was put behind the fist.

Benjamin opened his eyes roundly.

‘Thi, this bastard. Really?’

When he thought up to that point.

Roan’s fist split the air.

Pagak!

“Kuk!”

Benjamin’s nose sat down with a dull sound.

“Thi, this crazy bastard!”

The surrounding corps commanders and staff officers approached with surprised expressions.

Roan didn’t even look at them and swung Travias spear.

Puk!

The spear was stuck in front of them.

“I told you. That if you get any closer, I will snap Benjamin’s neck.”

“Kugh.”

The commanders and officers couldn’t approach anymore.

They didn’t know what to do and just looked at Benjamin’s face.

A face covered with blood.

“Uhhhh.”

Benjamin gritted his teeth and trembled.

He didn’t know that Roan would actually hit him.

“So, son of a bitch. Do you think you will be safe aft…..”

But he couldn’t continue speaking.

Because Roan swung his fist once again.

Puk! Pubuk! Puk!

Roan punched Benjamin’s face with a casual expression.

His teeth broke and his nose completely broke.

His eyelids and forehead teared up.

“Uoooooo.”

Benjamin was not himself.

He tried to dodge Roan’s fists but it was useless.

But because Roan increased the Flamdor mana technique to the peak, he couldn’t move his body as he wished.

But even so, it wasn’t that Benjamin didn’t use mana.

‘Ho, how is he this strong!’

Despair appeared on his face.

“Kuhok.”

Benjamin breathed in deeply.

It was difficult to breath because of his broken nose.

‘Please, someone stop this bastard.’

An earnest look.

But there was no one that stopped him.

In the end, a regrettable sound came out of Benjamin’s mouth.

“Kugh. Ple, please sto, stop…….”

But Roan didn’t stop hitting him.

‘This isn’t simply revenge for what just happened.’

His eyes became fierce.

‘My past life. Revenge for having ruined it.’

Pubuk!

Consecutive punches landed on his face.

“Kugh! Kugh!”

Benjamin now even shed tears.

“Pl, please. Please stop…..”

He had thrown away his dignity and pride.

Fear of not knowing if he may lose if life if he kept getting hit paralyzed his rationality.

“Sob. Sob. Sob.”

The sorrowful crying sound rang in the plain.

But Roan just ignored it.

When he raised his fist once again.

“What is happening right now!”

A yell hit his ear.

Roan turned his head while still grabbing on Benjamin’s throat.

‘Count Lancephil.’

The one that had yelled was Io.

However, Io’s sight moved behind Io.

‘Pens.’

Pens, who had separated with him after the thing with the fake storage, was standing over there.

‘Maybe, already?’

Roan had a surprised expression.

Pens looked at that Roan and slightly winked.

It was a look that was smiling faintly and even nodding.

Roan let out a short sigh.

‘It seems like it was done faster than what I thought.’

A smile appeared on his face.

Only then did Roan loosen the hand that was choking Benjamin.

Tuk.

Benjamin fell as if he collapsed and buried his face on the ground.

“Huok. Huok. Huok.”

He breathed in coarsely and poured out tears.

Roan just looked at that Benjamin and wiped off the blood in his face.

Meanwhile, Io walked and stood in front of Roan.

“What happened?”

A blunt voice and expression.

Roan just bowed instead of replying.

“Si, sir count. What just happened……..”

When Roan stepped in and tried to explain the situation.

“Sob. Count Lancephil.”

Benjamin stood up.

“Mm.”

Io looked at Benjamin’s face and let out a low exclamation.

‘He’s completely broken.’

He didn’t have even a normal place on his face.

Benjamin yelled out.

“Count Lancephil! A mere commoner troop commander bastard has insulted me! On top of that, even the soldiers of the 7th corps have disobeyed my orders and rebelled!”

He wasn’t himself.

Io frowned and looked at Roan.

Then, Aaron walked to the front and bowed.

“Sir count. Actually……”

The explanation happened for a while.

He explained everything that happened slowly.

As Io was here anyways, he didn’t need to be wary of Benjamin.

“Mm.”

Io, who heard everything, glared at Benjamin.

‘Benjamin. You stupid bastard, you spilled the plate because of your greed for merits.’

He now knew why there were this many allied corpses even when they had won the war.

‘On top of that, to badmouth the fallen comrades……..Trash like bastard.’

Io clicked his tongue with a displeased expression.

As he was originally a soldier that roamed the battlefield, he thought of comrades and allies quite importantly.

Because of that, Benjamin’s doings made him really angry.

Benjamin, who didn’t know how Io was feeling, said nonsense.

“Chasing a retreating enemy army is a basic thing in strategy. The 7th corps commander didn’t have the abilities and is just putting up excuses. On top of that, it’s not that the corpses are going to disappear, so we can do it after we chase them……..”

When he talked up to there.

“Shut up!”

Io couldn’t endure it anymore and yelled.

“Ye, yes?”

Benjamin staggered with a surprised expression.

Io looked at Benjamin’s eyes fixedly.

“Because of your useless pride and your greed for merits, more than 10,000 soldiers lost their lives. It’s not enough with apologizing while bowing but you even badmouth them? You trash like bastard.”

A cold voice.

“Co, Count Lancephil. I, it’s not that I……”

Only then did Benjamin get a hold of himself.

He realized what kind of person Io was late.

But even if it was late, it was just too late.

“Benjamin Doyle.”

Io glared at Benjamin in a frightening manner.

As he made a handsign to his back, the leader of the knights Kali Owells approached.

He took out a scroll from his chest.

Swush.

Io spread the scroll towards Benjamin.

“This is a dismissal order for you.”

At that moment, Benjamin, Aaron, Roan, and the soldiers of the eastern army had surprised expression.

“Ju, just what is……”

Benjamin received the paper with trembling hands.

It was clearly a dismissal order from his seat of the eastern region commander.

“Just why…….?”

Benjamin looked at Io.

Io’s expression was fierce.

“Setting up a formation at the rear Nerf region, instead of Bink region when Istel kingdom first started attacking. Battling against the enemy army more than 20 times and not being able to win. Cutting off assistance to the commanders that were patrolling while searching the eastern region to annihilate the enemy.”

The more he talked, the more Benjamin’s face turned white.

He kind of knew that Io was reporting the merits situation of the eastern region and the 7th corps to the royal palace.

However, he didn’t know that he would have grasped all these things this accurately.

‘Count Lancephil wouldn’t have had any mid because he was defending the eastern region. How……?’

It felt like someone had organized the information and gave it to him.

‘Ah!’

At that moment, Benjamin turned his head and looked at Roan.

‘Maybe, this bastard?’

The information squad Roan set up.

If it was them, they would be able to urgently take care of the information of the eastern region.

Roan’s and Benjamin’s sights interlocked.

Roan smiled just as if he read Benjamin’s thoughts.

“Ah……”

Benjamin let out a low exclamation.

‘It was that bastard.’

The puzzle pieces fell together.

It wasn’t enough with annihilating the enemy army entering the eastern region and attacking the supply storage, but he even utilized the information troop and was perfectly grasping the situation of the eastern army.

‘Scary bastard.’

Roan was more amazing and scary than what he had initially thought.

Just like Benjamin thought, the one that reported the situation of the eastern army to Io was Roan.

With Io’s temperament, it was obvious that if he got to know Benjamin’s failures he wouldn’t sit still.

Roan judged as Io would certainly report it to the royal palace.

‘It would have been difficult if this bastard still remained as the supreme commander even after this war ended.’

Roan glared at Benjamin with calm eyes.

‘Although the order came faster than what I thought……’

The reason why he was glad to see Pens appearing with Io was precisely because of this.

Benjamin wasn’t his superior anymore.

Things were untying better than thought.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“Although the orders of the royal palace was to chase you off the army and dismiss you from your seat…..”

He ground his teeth.

“I’m not planning to end it with just that. It wasn’t enough to lay an unreasonable order to the chasing troop and suffer an amazing blow, but you even badmouthed the deceased allies.”

Io made a hand sign to his back.

Two knights approached and grabbed Benjamin’s shoulders.

I will carefully investigate and grasp your actions and behaviors and ask you your sin. Imprison him at the rear of the camp.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The knights replied in one voice and then moved away.

“Cou, Count Lancephil! I, I feel it to be unfair! I just did my best for Rinse kingdom!”

Benjamin was dragged away and was yelling.

However Io didn’t even look at him.

And that was the same for the other corps commanders and staff officers.

They didn’t need to be wary of Benjamin or flatter him.

Because Benjamin wasn’t their superior anymore.

No, from now on, it would be better to take some distance.

If they made a mistake, they could get the same punishment as Benjamin.

“Roan.”

At Io’s call, Roan bowed once again.

“Yes. Count Lancephil.”

Roan was composed even after making Benjamin’s face become a bloody one.

Io let out a long sigh with stifled eyes.

‘What to do……’

He personally wanted to applaud him for his actions.

But military laws were laws.

If he let one thing pass, the discipline could crumble.

“I know what you were thinking when you did that. However…..”

Io let out a short sigh and continued speaking.

“Resorting to violence against a noble is a sin. I will ask you your sin after this.”

What was fortunate was that the dismissal order came ahead of this, so the sin of resorting to violence against a superior wasn’t implied.

“Yes. I understand.”

Roan replied with a composed expression.

Aaron wanted to step up and tried to defend him, but Io closed his eyes and shook his head.

It meant to not step in.

‘There’s nothing good by arguing in an open place.’

Aaron understood Io’s meaning and shut his mouth.

Two knights approached and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

Then, Roan who was silent, carefully opened his mouth.

“Count Lancephil.”

Io just looked at him as if implying what happened.

Roan hesitated for a moment and then bowed.

“I want to retrieve the corpses of my comrades.”

“Mm.”

Io gulped in the silence.

‘Even if he’s different to Benjamin, he’s just too much.’

Even the size of the plate was different.

The one that suited the position of supreme commander was Roan, and not Benjamin.

Io pondered for a moment and then nodded.

“Fine. Only, I will imprison you at the rear of the camp after the retrieving ends.”

“Yes. I understand.”

Roan bowed and then moved.

He carefully retrieved the corpses of the burnt soldiers.

Io looked at that and let out a long sigh.

‘What to do……..’

He felt stifled.

The deeper he thought, the deeper the pondering also became.

*****

The retrieval of the corpses was done quickly.

And Roan was imprisoned just like the order.

“Count Lancephil. Although Roan did something wrong, that’s all because of Benjamin Doyle. Take that into account please.”

Aaron earnestly defended Roan.

Io touched his chin and fell in his thoughts.

‘The reason we could win this war was because of Roan. That’s an irrefutable truth.’

Roan made a merit bigger than anyone.

If only this didn’t happen, he could even get promoted to corps commander.

‘On top of that, Roan’s ability is too precious to kill him like this.’

Io let out a long sigh once again.

Aaron looked at that and couldn’t open his mouth as he wished.

Because he also knew how deeply Io was thinking.

Then, Kali who was looking at the situation, said with a blunt voice.

“Violence against a noble is a sin. If you let this go, they will start talking at our backs even more.”

Those were right words.

Aaron said with an urgent voice.

“But shouldn’t we have to take into account Roan’s merits?”

Those also were right words.

“These aren’t merits to just be ignorant of and cover them.”

He fell in his thoughts once again.

Kali shook his head.

“Then, how about exile him to a dangerous territory and exempt him from the capital punishment?”

“Exile?”

Io showed a reaction.

Kali shrugged his shoulders and said.

“As everyone says that his talent is too valuable, can’t we send him to a fortress as a guard or as a slave?”

Aaron was surprised and shook his hands.

“We can’t make Roan’s talent rot in a place like that.”

At those words, Kali replied with a blunt voice.

“Laws are more important than talent. Law. On top of that…….”

Kali looked at Aaron’s eyes fixedly.

“If we exempt him from his sins and he remains here, will the other commanders see this in a good way? They may probably try to harm him.”

“That……..”

Aaron couldn’t speak anymore and shut his mouth.

He didn’t have the words to refute back.

And even if he wasn’t harmed, it was obvious that he may get really handicapped in the merits awards.

Then, Io that was in his thoughts, showed a faint smile.

“I think that exile him will be good, just like commander Kali says.”

“Ah……”

Aaron let out a low exclamation.

He wanted to fight back but he couldn’t do so. However, he didn’t have a solution or a reason to do so.

Aaron bowed with a half absent minded expression.

Then Io stood up and lightly patted Aaron’s shoulders.

A faint smile appeared in his mouth.

“Corps commander Tate.”

A gentle voice spoke out.

Aaron raised his head and looked at Io.

The smile on Io’s face became even wider.

“Don’t worry too much.”

He put more strength into his hands that were grabbing his shoulders.

“I thought of something good.”

Chapter 82




With the Istel kingdom’s retreat, the Byron kingdom also started to get cornered down.

Thanks to Roan’s plan, in suffering consecutive defeats, they had entered quite a deep region into Rinse kingdom.

And the supply line also became quite long.

On top of this, the central region of Rinse kingdom also joined up.

But a bigger problem than this exploded from the rear.

The orcs that were half annihilated last spring, from the huge scaled subjugations, started to suddenly gather up and attacked the supply lines that were in the region.

And even if they hadn’t done that, it was a big blow for the Byron kingdom that was working really hard as the supply line enlarged.

They could only hurry to retreat and in the meanwhile, they suffered a big blow.

Unfortunately, there was no such existence like Peid of the Istel kingdom in the rear guard of the Byron kingdom.

Actually, the orcs gathering and attacking the supply lines was all Roan’s plan.

Roan sent Chris to the southern region of the Byron kingdom and visited the small and large orc tribes.

The orcs, who couldn’t acquire any harvests properly because of the subjugation tactic, showed interest in the information of the supply lines Chris brought.

And as they also entered a deep part of Rinse kingdom in this situation, the defenses became quite sloppy.

The orcs, who were doubtful at first, saw that the situation was turning favorable and decided to attack the Byron kingdom’s supply line just like Roan and Chris wanted them to.

So for the Byron kingdom, they couldn’t continue the war and fled as all these things happened.

The only unfortunate thing was that Rinse kingdom wasn’t aware that the attacks of the orcs were all devised by Roan and Chris.

And it was because Chris was retreating while evading the Byron kingdom that he still couldn’t send the notices about it.

For Roan, committing the sin of violence against a noble was quite an unfortunate situation.

If this merit was known, his punishment would have become a bit lighter.

“Roan.”

“Yes. Sir Count.”

Roan was kneeling while he was tied up with ropes.

He looked like a sinner.

Io looked at him with unfortunate eyes.

Io let out a short sigh and said.

“Violence against a noble is a really big sin. It’s a sin where the last resort of punishment could be applied.”

Roan didn’t show any reactions.

Io continued speaking.

“However, bringing victory in this fierce war is also another truth. We can’t kill the hero of the kingdom.”

The corps commanders that were assisting all took in a deep breath.

Their expressions were that they couldn’t guess at all how the situation would flow.

Io touched his chin with his fingers.

“I, Io Lancephil, will lay down the punishment instead of the supreme commander of the eastern region.”

His mouth raised up.

“I will demote troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop of the 7th corps to that of a normal soldier and exile him.”

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out of the mouths of the commanders.

It was a fiercer punishment than what he had thought.

As they originally knew that Io appreciated Roan, they had the suspicions that he would just let it pass.

They just thought that the punishment would be a demotion and a cut of his salary.

‘He’s certainly Count Lancephil.’

‘He’s someone that has it clearly differentiated.’

The commanders applauded at Io’s fair decision.

Like this, their shaken discipline would become firm.

On the other side, Roan’s expression was excessively calm.

‘Exile……..’

Actually, the punishment Roan thought of was getting sold as a slave.

Compared to that, exile was quite the light punishment.

‘Although I was just planning to flee in regards to whatever I became.’

Roan had many choices.

This was something possible as he knew the future.

‘The first was taking place here in the eastern region…….’

If it was possible, he wanted to stay in Lancephil’s territory.

‘Because I thought that the big thing that would happen here was a big opportunity.’

There was a suitable opportunity to raise up a force.

Six years from now on, a big disaster happens in Lancephil’s territory.

It was the day that all the territory fell into chaos.

‘Then, an opportunity would certainly come.’

To grab that opportunity, he learned the Flamdor mana technique and returned once again to the eastern region.

But now, it wasn’t a situation where he could stay here anymore.

‘The second is going to the Grain mountains.’

It was more difficult than the first one and complicated as well, but it still wasn’t something bad.

On top of that, as the Grain mountain ranges were quite steep, it was a region where patrolling was almost impossible if he dedicated to hide himself.

‘It’s the most suitable place for a castaway.’

Although the situation was certainly difficult, it wasn’t that he didn’t have holes to escape.

Roan calmly organized the thoughts in his head.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“The place you will be exiled to is……..”

He dimmed his last words.

Aaron and the other commanders looked at Io’s mouth.

Io took in a breath and said.

“It’s the region of Tale.”

At that moment, the faces of several commanders contorted.

On the other side, there was surprise on Aaron’s face.

On top of that, his mouth was slightly raised up.

Io looked at Aaron and lightly smiled.

Just like.

‘I told you not to worry.’

He had a feeling that he was saying that.

Roan, who was maintaining a calm expression, also had a surprised expression now.

‘Tale?’

Laughs kept coming out.

The countless plans in his head all crumbled.

‘If it’s Tale……’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘I won’t have to go to the Grain mountains.’

The need to become a castaway and suffer the dangers had disappeared.

The region of Tale.

It certainly was a region where monsters appeared frequently and was left behind.

But the reason a smile appeared on Roan’s and Aaron’s mouth.

That was because the region of Tale was located inside Lancephil’s territory.

*****

The region of Tale.

It was a dangerous region located in the southeast of Lancephil’s territory.

It was close to Poskein lake and was surrounded by big and small mountains.

Different from the other regions, the soil wasn’t that good and as monsters frequented there a lot, there weren’t as many people living there.

It was one of the several exiling places that even the Lancephil family didn’t want to get involved with.

Most of the commander agreed that they should send him to an exiling ground to the west or the south instead of the region of Tale.

However Io wasn’t planning to back down anymore.

He was sending Roan to a place where he could reveal his talent and accumulate merits.

Several opinions came for the next four days.

In the end, both sides took a step back.

They decided that the soldiers of the 2nd troop should also be exiled along with Roan.

‘I have to send Roan with the army he was together with. So they won’t be able to think of nothing much when they come back.’

The commanders were excessively aware against Roan.

Most of them got the position of corps commander by inheriting it.

They were petty humans that were worried that their seats would be taken away.

Roan and Aaron opposed their opinions but they couldn’t go against the majority.

In the end, everything gwas decided like this.

Roan was exiled to the region of Tale and the soldiers of 2nd rose troop would be following him.

Meanwhile, Benjamin’s powerlessness was revealed and he was taken into custody in Miller.

He tried to get some commanders by his side while expressing his unfairness.

But the commanders weren’t by his side anymore.

No, they pushed back Benjamin more fiercely just in case they would also suffer because of him.

In that situation, it was revealed that Benjamin laid down an unreasonable order to several corps of the region, including the 7th corps.

Io sent his opinion paper to the royal palace that they should take away the title of nobility from Benjamin and that they should exile him.

‘If my opinion is received, Roan using violence against a noble doesn’t become that big of a problem.’

Aaron just hoped for the royal palace to make the right decisions.

And the situation became organized like that quite quickly.

The commanders all returned to their headquarters to organize the region.

They started to leave one by one and the only ones that remained were Io and Aaron.

“Commander Tate. Don’t worry too much.”

“Yes. I will just believe in you.”

Aaron bowed.

He saw Roan, tied up in tight ropes, behind Io.

‘It’s a region located inside of the count’s territory. If he takes care of him……’

Rather, it could become an opportunity to reverse things.

Io patted Aaron’s shoulder and got up on his horse.

Hiiiing.

Lancephil’s army started to move with the cry of the horse.

Their territory was Pavor, the area that had the lord’s castle.

Aaron just looked at the march while standing at the entrance.

“Roan.”

Roan passed in front of his eyes.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

“Don’t worry too much.”

It was a farewell like it was nothing.

Aaron felt something in his chest and he ground his teeth.

“I’m sorry.”

These were words he hardly brought out.

Roan just smiled faintly at that.

The rope that was tied to the horse kept pulling him.

Roan walked and in the meanwhile, saluted Aaron.

He had a composed and calm look.

Aaron was moved for nothing and turned his head.

He didn’t have the courage to look at Roan anymore.

Then, his eyes turned round.

“You……..”

He saw a familiar group behind the march of the count.

It was Austin and the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop.

They had packed their things and were following the march.

The soldiers bowed towards Aaron before leaving the camp.

“We have decided to follow troop commander Roan.”

These were Austin’s words.

The other soldiers all nodded with resolute expressions.

“Are you saying that you will follow him to that dangerous place?”

“Yes. We were chased out of the army anyways. We don’t have anywhere to go anymore.”

Austin turned his head and looked at Roan’s back getting farther away.

“The troop commander became like that while protecting us.”

He took in a deep breath.

“As troop commander protected us, now we should be the ones protecting him.”

At those words, Aaron slowly nodded.

“You are better than me.”

Passionate gazes were exchanged.

Austin and the others bowed once again and then started to move.

Aaron looked at them and clenched his fist.

“Everyone, just wait a little bit for me.”

Flames appeared in a deep part inside of his eyes.

“I will certainly make you return to where you belong.”

*****

The march stopped earlier than what was thought.

As Io couldn’t see the camp of the region, he stopped the march and went to Roan.

“Loosen his ropes.”

At the short order, some soldiers gathered and cut off the ropes.

Behind Io, Kali shook his head with a displeased expression.

Io made a hand sign towards the soldiers of the 2nd rose troop who were looking at themselves at the back of the march.

Austin and the others hesitated for a moment and then stood in a line behind Roan.

“What’s the reason you followed us?”

At those words Austin replied with a slightly nervous expression.

“We decided to be together with troop commander Roan.”

“Are you saying you are also following him to the place of exile?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

Austin replied without hesitation.

Io smirked and shook his head.

“You can’t enter a place of exile if you aren’t a sinner.”

At those words, Austin and the soldiers hit their chests and said.

“Then make us one. Disobeying orders on the battlefield is also a sin.”

“Send us to the place of exile too.”

He replied in a voice that was as hot and earnest as his eyes.

Roan looked at the expressions of the soldiers with a stifled expression.

It was an expression that showed that he was both sorry and thankful.

He couldn’t say anything.

Then, Io’s voice was heard.

“There’s no need to do so. I don’t think of Roan as a sinner.”

He faintly smiled and said.

“Because the other commanders were watching and because of the army’s discipline, I did say that he should get exiled but I don’t think of Roan as a sinner. Rather, I think of him as an excellent commander.”

Io looked at the faces of Roan andthe soldiers alternately.

“I’m planning to send Roan to a territory of a Lancephil’s family territory. I’m going to give him a small troop and make him subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale.”

It wasn’t a simple exile.

He was planning to entrust Roan with that region.

Roan and the soldiers had surprised expressions.

Io didn’t mind and continued saying.

“Roan. Will you be able to do it?”

The region of Tale was a place that even the family of Lancephil couldn’t lay a hand on it as they wished. Making him subjugate that place was more dangerous and difficult than one could think.

However Roan didn’t hesitate.

He bowed.

“Yes. I’m confident.”

As soon as he said that, Austin and the soldiers laid down on the ground.

“Sir count. Take us into your territory. We will subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale along with troop commander Roan.”

“Take us into account.”

At those words, Io faintly smiled and looked at Roan.

“What do you want me to do?”

At the question, Roan copied the soldiers and laid down.

“I want to be together with them.”

He spoke in an earnest voice.

Silence lasted for a moment.

Io slowly nodded.

“Good. I will take in all these soldiers.”

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out of the mouths of Roan and the soldiers.

A bright smile appeared on their faces.

Contrary to that, there was displeasure on the face of Kali.

‘How can he take such good care of him?’

He couldn’t understand Io’s treatment.

But it seemed like Io didn’t mind it at all.

“I will make a completely new troop for you.”

It was the moment that the 2nd rose troop, no, the rose troop became newly reborn.

Io looked into Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“Troop commander Roan. Will you use Rose as the name of the troop?”

At those words, Roan fell into his thoughts for a moment.

His thoughts of wanting to remain with the dead Gale, the adjutants, and the soldiers rose up like smoke through a chimney.

However, the name of rose troop was still that of a troop belonging to the 7th corps.

Roan slowly shook his head.

“I want to use another name.”

“Did you think of something?”

At the question, Roan nodded.

He turned his head and looked at Austin and the soldiers.

“Amaranth, we will be the Amaranth troop.”

He spoke in a low voice but with strength.

An exclamation came out of Io’s mouth.

“A flower that doesn’t wither…….It’s a really good name.”

It meant that although he couldn’t use the name of rose troop, he would never forget his dead allies.

‘And I will never again lose my troop members.’

Now, the flower won’t be dying at all.

Because the newly born rose troop won’t wither for eternity.

Chapter 83




Roan and the Amaranth troop were directed to the region of Tale.

There was a small troop in the region of Tale which not many people chose to reside there.

The Sollum troop.

It was a troop composed of sinners that were exiled and they were the ones responsible for not letting the monsters of the Tale region trespass.

The numbers amounted to only 500 people, it was being in charge of the adjutant by the troop commander.

‘They’re guys with lots of problems.’

The soldiers that composed the Sollum troop were all sinners that made some sort of trouble.

Io wrote an order himself and assigned the Sollum troop below the Amaranth troop.

‘But there’s no way they would follow me easily.’

Roan had to first make Sollum troop follow him.

‘I have to raise a force with the Tale region as the base.’

They had to become a force that would be able to be picked in the eastern region in at least six years.

And fortunately, Roan was confident in being able to do so and he had the plans to do so.

‘That’s why I was protecting the eastern region.’

He could feel that it was unfair because of the unreasonable treatment he received and could have fled to another kingdom.

But if he did so, all the things he remembered about the future would all become useless.

‘The things I remember clearly are things that happened with Rinse kingdom as the center. On top of that……..’

There was no guarantee that he would keep getting promoted just because he fled to another kingdom.

Especially for Roan, who had already amassed big merits for Rinse kingdom, this was even more so.

‘The commanders that fled from another country receive quite the harsh treatment.’

You wouldn’t know it if you had the force or the abilities to beat that treatment, but at least it wasn’t easy for Roan as of now.

‘Even the trial that’s called to be a tyrant was thrown away after being exiled.’

The exile was a last resort.

In the end, raising a force inside Rinse kingdom was the most reasonable thing.

‘But right now, we don’t have the strength necessary to raise an independent force.’

He was still a noble and his rank was also a mere troop commander.

‘For now, I have to build my strength below the shadow of the Lancephil family.’

The Lancephil family would suffer big changes in six years anyways.

‘I have to become a person that can lead that change.

Roan clenched his fists.

He saw the entrance of Tale region from far away.

The entrance was surrounded with loose wooden fences.

There was a warning note written around it that you shouldn’t enter thoughtlessly.

‘Is it really starting?’

A smile appeared on his face.

He, who was a mere greenhorn spearman of the 13th squad of rose troop, was now a commander of a troop.

On top of that, he also became responsible for a region.

Compared to his past life, it was a commendable growth.

‘Then, shall we go meet the Sollum troop?’

His steps were light.

A faint expectation was seen in the faces of the troop members following his back.

A cool wind blew.

Soon, even autumn was coming to an end.

*****

It was a leisure afternoon.

It was a leisure he hadn’t felt in quite a while.

A man that wasn’t big but strong was humming below the shade of a tree.

“Hmm. Hm. Hmm.”

A relaxed expression was on his face.

‘I, I would like it if this went on for four more days.’

He extended his arms while yawning.

However, his hopes crumbled because of the youth that was running to him from far away.

“Troop commander Semi!”

A voice as big as his body rang out.

The man, Semi, slightly raised up his head and looked at the youth.

“What? Did monsters appear again?”

At those words, the other man shook his head.

“No. Not that……”

“Then?”

Semi frowned.

The youth continued saying.

“The people sent by the Lancephil family have come.”

“What! Lancephil family?!”

Semi stood up abruptly and had a surprised expression.

‘Ah! Am I finally getting out of this disgusting region?!’

A smile blossomed on his face.

Semi.

He was the troop commander in charge of the Sollum troop.

Semi danced and hugged the youth.

“Hamon. It was nice unti… bullshit. Anyways, thanks for what you’ve done until now.”

“Yes? Um, troop commander…..”

The youth Hamon awkwardly smiled and pushed off Semi.

“It seems like you have thought of the wrong things. The people that the Lancephil family sent……”

His voice became lower.

“Are the superior troops that will be leading us.”

At that moment, Semi, who was dancing, abruptly stopped.

“Huh? What did you say? What?”

He frowned and asked back.

Hamon let out a sigh instead of replying back and pointed to the entrance.

He had eyes that meant that he would know if he went over there.

“This fuc……..”

At that moment, curses came out of Semi’s mouth.

“They put us in here without contacting us at all but what? A superior troop? They’re really speaking bullshit.”

The pent up anger surged out.

Because of his hot temperament he made small and big accidents and was exiled to the Tale region, but his temperament didn’t change easily.

“Be it Count Lancephil or what, it’s so dirty that I will throw everything. Pth!”

Semi spat on the ground and started to walk.

‘So the guy that would lead us came, right? Good. Let’s see him once.’

His anger had already surged up into his head.

Hamon, who was looking at that, let out a short sigh.

“He’s out of himself again. He will regret it all later on. Tch.”

Meanwhile, Semi arrived at the entrance.

At that moment, his face became even rmore red.

‘This fuck. That greenhorn wouldn’t be my superior, right?’

The place Semi’s sight was staying at.

It was none other than Roan who was standing over there.

Semi moved his feet and stood in front of Roan.

“What are you guys?”

It was a rough talking to.

It was a rude and conceited attitude.

But Roan didn’t say anything.

Austin, who was at the back, walked to the front and gave him the order.

Semi spread the order roughly and started to curse.

“Damn! It’s so dirty, I won’t be able to do this!”

He shook the order and snorted.

“Hmph! So this troop that’s called Amara-what is really a superior troop than ours?”

Only then did Roan slowly open his mouth.

“It’s just like the order says.”

At those words, Semi looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“And you are the troop commander of Amaranth?”

“That’s right.”

Roan’s expression and voice was composed.

Semi had an expression that it was absurd.

‘I have to follow the orders of this greenhorn?’

The anger surged up once again.

‘I would rather go to jail.’

Jail and the region of Tale.

When they told him to choose one of the two, he chose the Tale region.

And that was already two years ago.

From the past two years, he subjugated the monsters.

‘It was dirtily exhausting, and dirtily annoying, but even so, I was the king here.’

The ones managing the Tale region were only the Sollum troop and the one leading that troop, himself.

With just that one thing, he could endure the hell-like times.

However, even that seemed to get taken away.

He couldn’t let that happen.

He couldn’t let that be taken away.

‘Here the Sollum troop is, I am the king!’

He looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“We have to take your orders? Don’t speak bullshit.”

Semi snorted.

“Even at first glance you are a greenhorn bastard that just finished his training. I don’t know how you bought Count Lancephil’s interest, but we have this region grasped tightly.”

At that moment, Austin got angry and stood up.

“Troop commander Semi! Your words are too…..”

“It’s fine.”

However Roan raised his hand and stopped him.

Roan looked at Semi’s eyes fixedly.

“So what do you want me to do?”

“What should you do? You and your Amaranth troop just have to shut their mouths and suck your fingers behind us. Why? Do you feel it unfair? If you do……”

“If I do?”

“Try to fight back with that childish and soft hand of yours. Kukuku. Instead, I don’t hold any mercy to the ones attacking me, so take that into account.”

It was a voice filled with confidence.

Roan just thought of that as funny.

‘As expected.’

When he first heard stories about the Sollum troop, he had kind of expected this situation.

They were troublemakers.

The worst of the worst.

There was no way those kind of guys would simply follow his orders.

“Can’t let you like this. Let’s hit you for now.”

“What?”

At Roan’s words, Semi frowned.

Then.

Roan’s fist split the air.

“Hup!”

Semi was surprised and fell back.

The fist barely stopped in front of Semi’s nose.

Huk.

Wind pressure was felt on the tip of his nose.

“This son of a bitch!”

Semi’s face became red.

He ran towards Roan.

You could see that his anger was already boiling over his head.

His movements were as fast as his hard body.

Whong! Woong!

His two fists and legs split the air continuously.

It was an intent that wanted to drop Roan onto the ground.

However, all of Semi’s attacks only hit the empty air.

Roan dodged all of his attacks with the minimum amount of movement possible.

“So slow.”

Roan smirked and moved.

He dodged Semi’s fist and closed in on him.

“Huh?”

When Semi had a surprised expression.

Roan’s fists split the air.

Pububuk! Pubuk!

He didn’t use mana.

But even so, his bones and muscles that were restructured after the overflowing mana were more outstanding than a normal person’s.

“Kuk!”

Semi was hit in the chest and abdomen and fell down.

“Troop commander!”

Hamon yelled.

He glared at Roan and ran towards him.

Hamon was enduring it well until now, but actually, he was as hot tempered as Semi.

Woong.

A huge fist split the air.

Roan twisted his body and lightly dodged him and then hit Hamon in his crotch.

Pagak.

“Kugk! Thi, this bastard!”

Hamon lost balance and tottered, but he still cursed out.

Roan grabbed Hamon’s throat like that.

A thread of mana surged up from the mana hole.

Uduk.

The muscles in his right arm swelled up.

“Kuk!”

Hamon struggled when he felt that his breath was getting cut off.

His two feet were separated from the ground.

‘Wha, what kind of strength……’

Hamon and even Semi who was looking from the sides had surprised expressions.

This was because a small Roan raised up Hamon with one hand.

Hamon struggled while being up in the air.

However he couldn’t free himself from Roan’s grip.

‘He, he’s a monster.’

Semi unconsciously stepped back.

The anger that surged up over his head quickly died out.

‘Did I make a mistake?’

He woke himself up too late.

‘Now that I see it, even the guys of the Amaranth troop……’

Even when a fuss was happening, there was no one among the soldiers that moved.

The intent hidden inside the solid formation.

‘They are elite soldiers. It’s a powerful army.’

Cold sweat flowed down his back.

Semi inwardly blamed his hot temperament.

Gulp.

Dry saliva passed down on its own.

Nervousness could be seen in his face.

Roan looked at Semi and put on a smile.

‘It’s just like what Count Lancephil said.’

Although the Sollum troop was composed of sinners, they weren’t vile people.

Rather, they believed in their own abilities or talents and acted as they wished.

If he could make Sollum troop come to his side, it would be of great help for his force.

‘Anyways, it’s comfortable as I don’t have to hide my mana anymore.’

Roan talked with Io about things related to mana techniques before separating.

You wouldn’t know about other places, but the Tale region was quite a secluded place and was the most suitable place to train in his mana.

In Roan’s position, there was no need to be aware of other people anymore.

“Listen well.”

His voice was quite calm.

“I’m troop commander Roan of Amaranth troop. Although it was the order of Count Lancephil, I have no thoughts of forcefully commanding you.”

Roan turned to look at Semi.

“Come find me when you want to be commanded by me. Until then, I won’t butt into your things.”

He loosened the strength in his grip after saying that.

Tuk.

“Kek. Kek.”

Hamon started to cough after he fell onto the ground.

He didn’t think of attacking him again and fell back.

Roan saw that and put on a bitter smile.

‘I didn’t want to use force like this……..’

But there was a need to show a suitable amount of strength to control the troublemaking soldiers.

And of course, he wasn’t planning to forcefully make them follow him after pressing them down with strength.

‘I will make them follow me on their own.’

He wanted to make them follow him first with their hearts, and then with their thoughts.

Now was the start.

Roan turned back.

Amaranth troop followed his back while maintaining formation.

“Whew. I thought I would die.”

Hamon let out a long sigh and touched his neck.

Semi, who saw Roan and the troop disappear into the distance, frowned.

‘What to do……’

He couldn’t make a decision.

If Roan used force and tried to forcefully command the Sollum troop, they would have all rebelled roughly.

‘Because the 500 people of Sollum troop are all like that.’

But as Roan made one step back, he felt somewhat frustrated.

Even if he wanted to rebel, the reason to do so had disappeared.

On top of that, the truth was that Roan was too strong to the point that he was able to easily toy with him and Hamon. This made him feel uneasy.

“What kind of guy could he have been? Even the soldiers that came with him seemed to be beyond normal.”

At Hamon’s words, Semi’s face contorted.

He was hit while not being able to resist properly.

As Hamon complemented Roan and the troop in that situation, Semi’s anger surged up.

“How do I know that?! Go and do what you were doing!”

At the sudden rebuking words, Hamon smacked his lips.

‘He’s taking it out on me.’

He hid his thoughts and saluted and then walked towards his headquarters.

It was best to hide himself when Semi was angry.

Today was quite an eventful day for Semi for many reasons.

‘Damn. I don’t know. Don’t know. I’ll know if I keep watching them.’

This Tale region was different from the others.

It wasn’t a place where a troop that popped up out of nowhere could get accustomed to and endure easily.

Even if Roan and the troop were strong, he had a need to check if they could adapt well to this region.

‘Even Sollum troop took three years in taking a place.’

At least in this place, Sollum troop was like the elites.

Roan and Amaranth troop.

Semi and Sollum troop.

Two completely different troops were taking place in the same region.

A flower that never withers and soil.

The relationship started like that.

*****

Although the headquarters were quite old and shabby, it still had useful buildings.

Amaranth troop checked the buildings thoroughly and made a place for themselves on the opposite side of Sollum troop.

Roan remembered the continued forced march and ordered a rest for two days.

Meanwhile some soldiers of Sollum troop approached their headquarters and made some fuss, but no big incident occurred.

Even Roan started to “rest” in his place.

He started to inspect his plans and trained in the Flamdor mana technique.

The current level of Roan’s mana level was like that of a novice knight.

And it was all thanks to the overflowing of his mana that his mana hole, mana road, bones, and muscles were reconstructed and strengthened.

As he didn’t know much about mana techniques, he was lacking comprehension about it.

‘When the troop stabilizes, I will have to buy books and accumulate them.’

There were many things he had to do.

He had to bring books and goods from the house that was in Beno castle, and he had to earnestly manage Chris’s agency and the five invested people and make them grow.

But most of all, what he had to do first.

‘I have to change the structure of the troop.’

It was a roughly made up troop.

‘Although I couldn’t touch the formation as I wished until now, but now the situation has changed.’

Amaranth troop was completely Roan’s.

He was planning to apply one of the formations developed after the era of the great wars to Amaranth troop.

‘To lead a small scaled troop effectively, it’s good to use groups of ten.’

He would group 10 soldiers to become one and give the commanding rights to one person.

‘I’m going to make hundred-man squads with the groups of ten as the base.’

Actually, the number of soldiers in Amaranth troop amounted to 400.

If he reorganized them as groups of ten, four squads of 100 and four commanders to lead the hundred-man squads.

‘I’ll use the basic strategies of the troop as the hundred man squad.’

Although the basic formation was that of ten men groups, what could become the basis of the strategy was a hundred man squad.

Roan quickly wrote down his thoughts on a piece of paper.

At first glance it felt like nothing, but it was the basics of the basics.

However what Roan was thinking about wasn’t only this.

The conditions of becoming a strong army wasn’t only composed by the soldiers.

‘I will have to slowly start some madmen of the small rooms.’

Madmen of small rooms.

People called them like that and fingered at them.

But they called themselves with other names.

A faint smile appeared in Roan’s mouth.

‘Alchemists.’

Chapter 84




Sponsored chapter



The madmen of small rooms, the alchemists.

They were scientists, engineers, or magicians that tried to convert minerals to become gold.

But the research of the alchemists that lasted tens and hundreds of years ended up in failure and their research started to take a weird turn.

They wanted to grasp the characteristics of the minerals itself and find methods to refine it, mixing minerals with other minerals, combining it to become weapons, equipments, and other things to make it more comfortable or reconstruct it to become stronger.

But of course, this was something 10 years in the future.

Actual alchemists were hidden in deep forests or empty villages to research and experiment in weird things and were judged as crazy people.

And that was because there were small and big accidents involved in it.

Because of that, people naturally moved far away from them.

‘I have to gather them starting from now.’

It would be late only after their research started to show accomplishments.

By then, the influential people of the kingdom or empire would gather them and set them up as the base.

‘When there aren’t guilds like right now is the most suitable time.’

Different from the knights or mages that had headquarters, alchemists didn’t even have a guild.

Roan was planning to make a guild for the alchemists near the Tale region.

It was one of the conditions for a strong army.

‘I also need outstanding weapons and not only outstanding soldiers.’

Roan was planning to entrust that to the alchemists.

‘On top of that, if I can gather engineers or blacksmiths…..’

But it probably wouldn’t be easy.

He was still exiled in the region of Tale.

He couldn’t come and go to other regions as he pleased.

‘In the end, I will have to resort to use mister Chris to help me out once again.’

He needed the help of Chris’s agency.

Roan was first planning to establish Chris’s agency near the region of Tale and use them as a means of contact.

‘Good. Let’s take it one step at a time.’

Roan took in a deep breath and stood up.

The plans he would face were now somewhat organized.

His heart beat.

The blood in his body circulated quickly.

‘Let’s make history.’

A blue light lit up in his eyes.

*****

“It’s somewhat amazing.”

“It’s a formation I hadn’t thought of at all.”

The troop members looked at each other and had surprised expressions.

Austin, who was pondering, raised his right hand.

“Is there a need to change formations? We’re all accustomed to the current formation actually.”

At those words, some soldiers nodded.

Their sight moved to Roan.

“That formation was filled with weak points.”

He replied in a composed voice.

Roan walked amongst the troop members and started to make a long explanation about the formation.

He also explained how roughly made the formations used in the squads, troops and corps were.

As his explanation became longer, a convinced look appeared in the faces of the soldiers.

“Ah! That’s why until now, the troop was operated in several divided sections.”

“Now that I see it, we moved in more small scaled groups than the other troops.”

“Can it be that that was like the ten men group?”

Several conversations could be heard.

‘They’re all quick to catch on.’

Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

When they still belonged to the 7th corps, the 2nd rose troop invested a lot of time in small group training and operations.

And that was all for the preparations for the establishment of the hundred men squad.

“If the entire formation changes then the positions of troop commander, adjutant, squad commander will also be changed.”

Especially, the adjutants who were crudely called commanders would be clearly differentiated from the ten-man leaders and hundred-man commanders.

If the size of the troop became larger, the thousand-man commander and ten thousand-man commander would also be implemented.

From here on, each task will get the role of staff officer.

“For now, I will name the four people that will become hundred-man commanders.”

At Roan’s words, nervousness was seen on the faces of the soldiers.

Especially on the faces of the squad commanders, a faint expectation appeared.

“I name Austin to become hundred-man commander to command and lead the entire troop instead of me.”

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out of Austin’s mouth.

The manager was a position that basically worked instead of the vice troop commander.

‘For me to become a manager…….’

Just a few months ago, he was working hard to get promoted to become a squad commander.

That Austin became a commander that would lead one hundred soldiers.

He slowly stood up and moved.

Roan lent him the declaration paper he had already prepared a few days ago.

Although there was no rank badge that suited with the new formation, Austin was deeply moved just with the declaration paper.

“I will do my best.”

His earnest voice rang out.

Roan patted Austin’s shoulders once and smiled.

‘If it’s Austin, he will work well.’

Followed by that, the naming of the second commander took place.

“I name Tane as the second hundred-man commander.”

Tane,who was a squad commander of the 13th squad of rose troop stood up with a half absent-minded expression.

“Squad commander Tane! Congratulations!”

Pete whistled and yelled while shaking his right arm.

And all the other troop members also clapped.

Because they all recognized Tane’s skills and merits that he had accumulated during the small and big battles.

“Let’s work hard from now on.”

Roan gave him the declaration paper and smiled.

Tane made a short salute.

“Sir! I will do my best!”

He spoke in a voice with strength.

‘Relationships are really fun.’

Roan smiled.

Just before a few weeks ago, he was a newcomer spearman of the 13th squad which Tane lead.

But now, he became a commander and a superior that led an entire troop and named Tane to become his second hundred man commander.

‘Who would have known that a greenhorn spearman would become a troop commander.’

Now that it turned out like this, there was no law that said that he wouldn’t be able to become a monarch.

Roan felt his emotions surging up and named the third commander.

“I name Pete as the third hundred-man commander.”

At that moment, silence fell.

Even Pete, who was whistling towards Tane, froze up like that.

Pete, who threw a fist towards Roan, couldn’t grasp the situation when he first returned to the past.

He had passed over several squad commander ranked soldiers and became a hundred-man commander.

The surrounding soldiers all looked at Pete with surprised expressions.

Pete got a hold of himself and pointed at his own face.

“Do, do you mean me?”

Roan just nodded.

At that moment.

“Waaa! Pete! You completely succeeded!”

“Amazing!”

“Pete, no. Commander! Congratulations!”

Several cheers were heard from everywhere.

Amaranth troop was at most 400 people.

They had established quite a solid relationship after the battles they faced together.

There was no one that felt displeased or was against Roan’s decision.

“Huh? Yeah. E, everyone thanks.”

Pete nodded with a shaking face and stood in front of Roan.

Roan gave him the decree and patted his shoulders.

“Let’s work hard.”

The reason he declared Pete as the third commander.

‘If Austin and Tane have the ability to command and lead, Pete is outstanding in the part of strength.’

A brave general that could face the enemies at the front.

That was Pete.

“I, I will do my best.”

Pete still had a half absent-minded expression.

He moved his feet and stood next to Tane.

Tane brightly smiled and poked Pete’s side.

“Congratulations.”

“Th, thank you.”

Pete smiled awkwardly and bowed.

He didn’t even know how to read but was staring at the decree as if his gaze would pierce through it.

‘I’m a hundred-man commander?’

Based on the original formation, he was a mere adjutant.

His emotions overflowed.

‘I can’t disappoint him.’

A resolution that he had to act according to Roan’s expectation surged up.

Meanwhile, Roan was naming the last commander.

Everyone was concentrating on Roan.

Although Pete was kind of unexpected, the hundred man commanders until now were kind of expected.

‘Now that Pete was the third, the fourth may be a really unexpected person.’

‘Who?’

Everyone gulped down their dry saliva.

Only then did Roan feel the strange gazes and slowly opened his mouth.

“I name Harrison as the fourth commander.”

Boom.

At that moment, a silence even worse fell than when Pete was declared spread out.

The gazes of the soldiers naturally fell on one place.

Their gazes were focused on a childish faced soldier.

It was Harrison.

‘M, me?’

He couldn’t even bring those words out.

Harrison was asking Roan while opening and closing his mouth.

Roan smiled faintly and nodded.

Harrison slowly stood up and carefully moved.

The surroundings were as still as a dead rat.

‘Harrison?’

‘He surpassed all the other squad commanders?’

Everyone had surprised looks.

Then.

“Harrison certainly has the proper qualifications to become a hundred-man commander!”

Pason, who was one of the basic squad commanders, yelled out.

“Right! Just looking at his skills in archery, he was the best of the 7th corps!”

“He even saved the life of troop commander several times!”

The other squad commanders added and yelled.

They knew really well what their role was.

Because of that, the heavy silence was blown away like a feather.

“Right. Just looking at his merits, he’s the best of the best.”

“Well, just looking at skills, the one who is the most suitable in the seat of a hundred-man commander is Harrison.”

The soldiers all started to nod with convinced expressions.

Cheers and applauses were heard everywhere.

‘Everyone…….’

Harrison looked at the troop members with an absent-minded expression.

Compared to the other soldiers, he wasn’t even from rose troop.

He had joined in late because of Roan.

‘For everyone to recognize me like this.’

One corner of his heart became hot.

His sight naturally turned to Roan.

‘Troop commander. I’m really thankful.’

Just a few months ago, he was a mere novice spearman.

However, because Roan recognized his talent in archery and taught him that, he became able to live a new life.

‘I won’t forget this grace even when I die.’

Harrison bowed towards Roan.

Roan lent him the decree and patted his shoulders.

“Harrison. Let’s keep working hard from now on.”

The words Roan said when he first met Harrison.

Harrison nodded with a moved face.

“Yes. I will stay with you until I die.”

His voice slightly trembled.

Roan smiled faintly.

Harrison wiped off the tears and stood next to Pete.

Like this, the naming of the four commanders ended.

Continued by that, the naming of the ten-man commanders and staff officers followed up.

The most important thing was the naming of the commander that would lead the information squad.

Pens, who originally lead the information squad, couldn’t enter the exile region of Tale and because of that, he had to name a new person responsible for that position.

Roan named Keep, who was the nimblest of them all.

And like this, the restructure of Amaranth troop concluded.

Roan dissolved the troop and opened up another meeting between commanders.

“You all should know it, but we’re no different from sinners.”

The hundred-man commanders and the information leader all nodded.

Roan kept talking.

“We have to face the monsters from the region of Tale.”

He spoke in a voice with strength.

Roan looked at Keep’s eyes fixedly.

“For now, the information squad will thoroughly investigate the region of Tale. You have to investigate the rivers, nests, mountains, and woods really carefully.”

He pointed at a wooden desk with his finger.

“I’m planning to make a map so you can grasp the region of Tale in one glance.”

“You mean a map?”

Austin asked back with a surprised expression.

Drawing up a map was quite a dangerous thing in this era.

If you slipped, you could even get the misunderstanding that you were a spy.

“This region of Tale is a really secluded place, different from other places. Because of that we are free from even the gazes of the people. There’s no need to worry that much.”

At those words, several people nodded.

However, they couldn’t do anything but they still felt a bit uneasy.

Tane asked back with a careful expression.

“But do you have a need to do that?”

As the appearance of monsters in this region was quite low, there was no need for the troop to act first.

The monsters would come attacking first if you just guarded the headquarters.

Roan clenched his fists at those words.

“I’m not planning to wait for the monsters to come to us.”

“Then…….?”

Everyone looked at Roan’s face.

A faint smile appeared on Roan’s mouth.

“We’re attacking the monsters first.”

He grabbed the table with both of his hands and then stuck out his head towards the commanders.

A voice and expression that overflowed with confidence.

However, a low voice but filled with strength followed.

“I’m planning to dry them up.”

Chapter 85




Sponsored Chapter

‘Damn.’

Curses came out on their own.

Semi glared in front of him.

The monsters amounted to 1,000.

And they were even various races mixed in as well

‘Goblin, kobold, nork……’

Although most of them were small sized monsters, you could see about ten little ogres that were exactly double the size of a human adult sprinkled around.

‘I was crazy. Fuck.’

Semi cursed out his stupidity, no, his rashness as he realized it too late.

‘I just had to guard the headquarters….’

Originally, there wouldn’t have been any problems if they just subjugated or chased away the monsters that approached the entrance.

But as they saw Roan and his troop moving out from the camp in the early morning, he couldn’t endure it.

‘Not being enough with making an information squad to investigate the region and changing the formation to a strange one, they also went out to subjugate monsters.’

It was an action he hadn’t thought of at all.

He kind of felt that he and the entire Sollum troop were cowards.

‘The owners of Tale region were us.’

It was a feeling that the ownership was passed over in an instant.

On top of that, his competitiveness where he didn’t want to lose to Roan rose up.

And fortunately, that was the same for the members of Sollum troop.

They didn’t want to see Amaranth troop, that was no different from a rock that rolled over, to just act as they pleased.

In the end, Semi left 100 men to guard the camp and charged out.

They charged over to the regions were monsters appeared quite frequently.

And the start wasn’t bad.

They annihilated the monsters that appeared at times and increased their spirit.

They arrived to their destination, it was a hill.

It was when he was resting and treating the wounded ones.

The forest below the hill started to shake.

The dense forest shook roughly and a sound shaking the ground hit their ears.

When Semi and the others were looking at the forest with a nervous look.

Pat!

An amazing number of monsters appeared from the forest.

This was an attack that they hadn’t expected.

That was what just happened right now.

“Wh, what do we do?”

Hamon had a really nervous look on his face.

Only then did Semi throw away all his useless thoughts and bit his lower lip.

“What do you want to do? Of course we have to fight.”

The monsters had already approached near the hill.

In this situation, they could only fight against the monsters.

‘Although its 400 against 1,000, they’re mostly small monsters. On top of that, we’re positioned on higher ground so it’s not that we don’t have a chance.’

Semi, who was quite hot tempered, had his head cleared up in front of a big fight.

Because he knew that if the commander lost his rationality here, the entire troop would get annihilated.

“We are getting the little ogres first.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The adjutants answered in one voice and stood in front of their respective squads.

400 soldiers raised their weapons with nervous looks.

“Kuaaa!”

“Kiek!”

The monsters cried out.

The ground shook and white dust surged up.

“Charge!”

And the order of charging also fell from Semi’s mouth.

His eye became red.

And a strange heat surged up from his entire face.

“Kill!”

Yells that were used to raise the morale poured out from the soldiers.

Bang!

Finally, the Sollum troop clashed against the monsters.

Slash! Stab!

The limbs of the monsters began to get cut off along with horrible sounds.

“Kiek!”

“Kek!”

The goblins or kobolds that were a lot smaller than an adult couldn’t properly resist and collapsed.

The personal strength of each troop member was that strong.

However, their performance was only up to there. The limit for Sollum troop was clear.

Because it was the first time they faced such a large scaled battle.

“Little ogre! Aim for the little ogres!”

“Infantry! To the right! Not there! Right! Right!”

Semi yelled with all his strength.

But the order couldn’t get properly executed. Each adjutant moved their respective squad as they wished.

No, they couldn’t even command the squad members properly.

To say that they were one troop was a tragic understatement.

The formation that had a rectangular shape was now separated at several pieces.

And monsters charged in from those spaces.

“Kok!”

“Kuk! Your side was pierced through!”

“The formation of the front crumbled!”

The formation that gwas turned aside once started to collapse even more.

Anyways, if their individual strength wasn’t good, they would already have been annihilated.

‘Damn! We endured well for two years but what is this?!’

Semi swung his blade while grinding his teeth.

‘Although monsters appeared frequently in this region, it’s the first time a troop as big as this has appeared……On top of that, this isn’t a simple attack.’

This was just like they were being chased by someone.

“Uak!”

“Kok!”

Several yells were heard from the surroundings.

Semi’s face stiffened.

‘Because of my powerlessness, my troop members……’

His eye trembled.

Although he blamed himself, it was already late.

‘Am I going to die like this…..’

A moment of life and death.

Then.

Sweeee!

A sharp sound was heard.

“Kiek!”

“Kek!”

The cries of the monsters were heard this time.

Puuuuu!

The sound of the horn trumpet was heard at the same time.

Semi and the troop members looked back.

A group of people that were attacking the monsters appeared.

A flag was waving around high above their heads.

A short word was written on the flocking flag.

<Amaranth.>

At that moment, joy appeared on everyone’s faces.

‘Amaranth troop!’

‘They’re here to rescue us!’

Their sight gathered at one point.

Bang!

Monsters were pushed back to the sides with a loud sound.

The place that was separated.

Roan was over there.

“Annihilate!”

A short order and the several signals were transmitted.

The flagman that was next to him shook two flags of different colors.

Puuuuu! Dung. Dung. Dung. Dung.

The sound of the horn trumpet and drums were heard.

Amaranth troop took a triangle formation as if they were waiting for it.

And of course, the one at the peak was Roan.

He pulled out Travias spear and emanated valor.

There was no need to hide his mana anymore.

The spear with a transparent light split the air and danced about.

Slash. Spat!

And everytime that happened, a horrible sound was heard.

“Kiek!”

Small monsters like goblins and kobolds couldn’t be Roan’s opponent.

And that was also the same for the little ogres.

They became perplexed at the mysterious movements of Roan’s spearmanship and stepped back.

The moment their formation crumbled.

The troop members of Amaranth ran to the sides.

Stab!

The weapon was stabbed into the sides of the little ogres.

“Kuang!”

A cry exploded out.

It had a look that he was at least trying to struggle.

However, followed by that, the troop members swung their spears.

Slash!

The spears, swords, axes, and daggers stabbed the head, neck, chest, and abdomen consecutively.

It was a perfect attack.

Boom!

The little ogre couldn’t endure it anymore and fell.

“Charge!”

The cry shook the battlefield.

The peak of Amaranth troop easily charged over the group of monsters.

Roan and the vanguard grouped up with the hopeless looking Sollum troop.

“Are you fine?”

These were lightly asked words.

‘I didn’t know they would copy us and go out to subjugate monsters.’

Roan sighed shortly.

After the Amaranth troop departed, the monsters were subjugated and they executed a big performance.

In that process, the small groups of monsters evaded Amaranth troop and fled to the west.

But Sollum troop just had to be over there.

Several small groups gathered and that number amounted to 1,000.

The Sollum troop was performing the role of anvil between a hammer and an anvil.

‘Anyways, I’m glad that we aren’t late.’

Roan faintly smiled and looked at Semi.

Semi also got a hold of himself late.

“Yes. I, I’m fine.”

Actually, even the members of Sollum troop were half absent-minded.

And that was because only 300 men were pushing back and massacring the monsters that amounted to 1,000 easily and were able to push them back to the sides.

‘I, is this the strength a troop has to have?’

Semi swallowed down dry saliva.

Roan looked at Semi once and shook his right hand to the back twice.

At that moment, the groups of a hundred men that were pushing back the monsters started to fall back.

The widely spread triangle shape shrank in an instant and then moved into a rectangle formation.

“Kiek!?”

“Kek?”

The monsters tilted their head when they saw the space that suddenly became empty.

Then, the flagman shook the flag to the sides.

The infantry that was at the front lowered their bodies and kneeled on one leg.

The archers who were at the back poured arrows as if they were waiting for it.

Sweee!

A sharp sound rang out.

Tens of arrows split the air consecutively.

Pubububuk!

Monsters collapsed after becoming porcupines.

And even among the archers, the one showing the most amazing skill was Harrison.

Harrison, who was leading the archer squad and some infantry, was hitting the medium sized monsters, compared to the other archers who were only hitting small monsters.

Puk!

It was a look that their forehead was precisely pierced.

“It, it’s an amazing ability.’

The members of the Sollum troop all opened their mouths.

It really was an ability close to marvelous.

“Kieeek!”

“Kuaa!”

As the monsters started to get pushed one sidedly, they let out cries and tried to rush in without any plans.

Roan took out Travias spear as if he was waiting for it and then charged forward.

Amaranth troop followed his back.

“Ah…..”

At that moment, Semin and his troop members let out low exclamations.

A shudder passed by their bodies.

This was because of the scene occurring in front of their eyes.

Amaranth troop was facing hundreds of monsters.

Their eyes became fixated at their backs.

“Kek!”

“Kugh!”

Amaranth troop clashed with the monsters.

The members of the troop moved in an orderly fashion.

If one person attacked, another put more strength into that attack, and the remaining ones filled in the flaws after the attack.

‘So this was what they trained in everyday at the training field!’

Semi became amazed and kept getting more amazed.

His sight naturally moved towards Roan.

This was the front of the front line.

It was the place you could say that was the most dangerous had Roan over there.

Pabababat!

Travias spear moved as if it danced around.

Pubuk! Puk!

The monsters that were close by were hit consecutively by fists and kicks and were bounced off.

It was a feeling that a long line of light was drawn following the spear.

Roan’s movements weren’t only destructive, but beautiful.

‘They aren’t my opponents.’

Semi realized Roan’s and the troop’s skills.

They weren’t opponents he or the Sollum troop could do anything about.

But strangely enough he didn’t feel powerless, rage, or despair.

‘I want to get in there and fight together with them.’

He wanted to display more power than what he had, just like the strength Amaranth troop had.

His face turned red at this boiling emotions.

But that wasn’t only Semi.

‘Will we also be able to move like that?’

‘How good would it be if I also had those kind of allies.’

Everyone from the Sollum troop looked at the battlefield with excited expressions.

Desire surged up in their eyes.

The opposition and antipathy they felt when they first met Amaranth troop had long since disappeared.

‘He said that he would wait until we wanted……’

Semi remembered Roan’s words clearly.

He turned to look back at his troop members and took in a deep breath.

‘It seems like that time is now.’

He laid the decision.

His sight moved over once again to the battlefield.

The fight was already coming to an end.

It was a complete victory.

It was a complete victory for Amaranth troop.

And it was also the first battle of the Amaranth troop that would one day will let the continent know of its name.

*****

‘Lost. Completely lost. Even the plate is different.’

Semi shook his head.

The place his eyes reached.

Roan was over there.

‘Just by rescuing our troop and safely returning us back is thankful enough…..’

Roan ordered Amaranth troop, that comparatively had fewer casualties to look after the injuries of Sollum troop.

In this situation, Semi became surprised at three things.

The first.

‘The troop members have absolute obedience at the orders of the troop commander.’

The second.

‘The level of treatment is higher than what I thought. Although it’s not at the professional level, they know really well how they have to treat injured people.’

It was all because of the various experiences of the battles they had faced until now, but there was no way Semi could know that.

But most of all, the reason he became more surprised than anything was because of the third cause.

‘It’s been exactly 20 days since Amaranth troop came here. But……..’

Semi’s sight moved over to Roan.

Roan was checking on the conditions of the Sollum troop members.

“If you rest for a while with a splint you’ll be fine, James.”

These were words he said calmly.

The soldier who was laying on the ground asked back with a surprised expression.

“How did you know my na……..?”

At those words, Roan just smiled instead of replying.

He stood up and checked on the condition of the next soldier.

“Darren. Check the condition of Lork. It seems like he’s lacking in bandages.”

“Bent. You lack water.”

“Kolp. You can’t move yet.”

The names came out without stopping.

Roan had memorized the names of the Sollum troop members.

And they were surprised each time their names were called.

“Troop commander. You even memorized the names of the Sollum troop soldiers?”

Austin, who was treating the injured ones next to him, was astounded.

At those words Roan shook his head.

“I still haven’t memorized everyone’s names.”

But even so, there was amazement in the faces of the surrounding soldiers.

‘There were a lot of things to do during the past twenty days……’

‘We changed the troop’s formation, repaired the camp, and even trained in the troop’s strategies.’

‘Meanwhile, he even memorized the names of the Sollum troop’s soldiers that don’t have any relationship with us?’

Roan was really moving around busily, as if he was really in need of ten extra bodies.

‘I have to do everything I can, and to the best that I can.’

For a commander to memorize the name of a soldier.

Roan thought that was the first thing a good commander had to do.

If you kept engaging in wars and battles, countless soldiers die and get hurt.

Different from the commanders, most of them couldn’t even leave behind their short name.

‘At least, I can’t let my soldiers die without a name.’

Of course, if the size of his army became the size of a corps, and then he became a supreme commander, he obviously wouldn’t be able to memorize everyone’s name.

‘By then, I will leave the names of my dead allies in words.’

This was so that people could remember and history would also remember them.

When his thoughts continued up to there.

A presence was felt at his back.

“Troop commander Roan.”

A familiar voice spoke out.

As he turned back, he saw Semi and the adjutants in a line.

And their expressions were really stern.

You could see the nervousness in their faces.

Roan immediately grasped their intentions.

‘It was faster than what I thought.’

Perhaps, cutting his morale on the first day would have been the most effective thing.

The deeply bowed head.

The armor that was covered with the blood of monsters was shining.

“Our Sollum troop…..”

His voice dimmed.

Semi raised his head and looked at Roan.

“Please command us.”

At that moment, silence fell over the entire camp.

It was obvious for Sollum troop, but even the members of Amaranth troop were looking at Roan.

Roan didn’t hesitate.

He smiled brightly and nodded.

“Fine.”

Roan looked at his surroundings and continued saying.

“From today on, Amaranth troop and Sollum troop are one.”

Chapter 86





The Amaranth troop and the Sollum troop really became just like one.

They named four more hundred-man commanders with the newly entered troop.

Meanwhile, Semi recognized Austin’s solid commanding.

And this was possible because Semi, who was a troop commander, took one step back.

There weren’t many troubles because the Sollum troop wasn’t forced to follow them, but they chose to do so themselves.

Roan mixed the troop members among themselves, even while taking into account to decrease the manpower.

And of course, after that, they continued to become stronger every day.

Now, Sollum troop existed no more.

Only one.

Amaranth troop became the only troop in the region of Tale.

Flock! Flock!

Two flags of different colors waved.

And at the same time, tens of hundred-man squads moved busily.

Infantry and archers gathered and separated.

Even when there were approximately 800 soldiers, you couldn’t hear anything noisy.

They only gave and received orders through the flags and signals.

And Roan looked at that from a high place.

‘They became accustomed to it faster than I thought.’

A faint smile appeared on his face.

Actually, he was kind of worried when he first received Sollum troop.

He was worried about them not being able to catch up with the training.

But fortunately enough, the Sollum troop members showed great skill in adaptability.

‘In this region of Tale, you get weeded out if you can’t adapt, and if you get weeded out, you die.’

Roan, who was looking down at the training ground raised his right hand.

Flock!

The flags that were waving at the sides crossed each other.

At that moment, the members of Amaranth troop took formation and organized themselves properly.

This was the end of troop training.

The movements were smooth and quick to the point you became amazed, but there were no changes in Roan’s expression.

“After finishing training, study the signals between each ten man groups.”

“Yes! Understood.”

Several hundred-man commanders replied in one voice.

Roan nodded with a satisfied expression and moved away.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

Rough breaths were heard in several places, as if they were waiting for it.

And most of them were made by the members of Sollum troop.

‘It’s really an unbelievable training.’

They had the feeling that they wanted to lay down immediately.

But they couldn’t do so.

No, they didn’t want to do so.

‘Anyways, we’re getting strong.’

‘We’re starting to coordinate.’

They had the feeling that they were getting stronger.

Although it was physically exhausting, their mentality at least was clear.

“We finished training with the hundred-man groups.”

The voices of the hundred-man commanders were heard.

The nine squads moved busily.

The troop members caught their breath and cooled down their muscles when Roan got out of the headquarters.

The place the head of the horse was heading to was the north entrance.

You could see sloppy wooden fences over there.

‘Because of Count Lancephil’s consideration, I can properly breath a little better.’

Originally, there had to be surveillance soldiers following the boundary of the territory.

However Io trusted in Roan and the Amaranth troop.

‘But even so, I can’t act as I please.’

Roan didn’t leave the Tale region as he wished.

As he approached the fences, he saw a familiar face.

“Troop commander.”

“Mister Pens.”

It was Pens of Chris’s agency.

Roan shook his hand at the welcoming feeling.

They exchanged greetings with the fence between them.

“Is the establishment going well?”

Roan was training the troop, subjugating the monsters, and at the same time, proceeding with the work of Chris’s agency.

Pens laughed awkwardly and fell to the sides.

“Talk that between you two.”

“Huh?”

When Roan tilted his head, he saw a familiar face behind Pens.

A smile appeared on Roan’s mouth.

“Mister Chris.”

“It’s really been a while. Troop commander Roan.”

A bright and clear voice.

The owner of the bright face was Chris.

*****

The torch in the walls pushed back the darkness.

A disgusting smell pinched the tip of your nose.

There were chains in the dirty wall.

Prison.

It certainly was a prison.

“What is this look.”

A regretful voice and expression rang out.

A middle aged man with luxurious clothes put his hand inside the bars.

Although there was a guard behind him, he didn’t stop him.

“Count Chase. There’s really no face.”

The dirty look of the middle aged man who was bowing.

Surprisingly enough, he was Benjamin Doyle.

Chulg.

Every time Benjamin moved, the chains on his wrists, neck, and ankles shook.

“Count Chase. Pl, please don’t throw me away. Ge, get me out of here.”

The expression and voice that couldn’t be earnest and was even mean.

The middle aged man with luxurious clothes, Jonathan Chase, patted Benjamin’s hand.

“Don’t worry. Is our relationship a normal one?”

He pretended to be aware of his surroundings and then lowered his voice.

“I’m convincing some nobles myself. In this situation what the seat of supreme commander of the eastern region, that bastard Io Lancephil, took away as he wished, will be yours.”

“Ah…….”

Benjamin bowed with a moved expression.

“Thank you. Really thank you. I will certainly pay back this grace.”

“Oho. How can you use that word in our relationship?”

Jonathan laughed.

“I prepared good food aside, so you just take care of your body.”

He spoke in a warm voice and with consideration.

Benjamin was now about to cry.

“I will only believe and follow Count Chase until I die.”

“Hahaha.”

Janathan burst out in laughter.

“Then, let’s meet outside of the prison next time.”

“Yes. I will accompany you to a good place then.”

Benjamin bowed.

Jonathan looked at that sight for a moment and then slowly moved his feet.

The guard who was at the back, followed Jonathan.

Clunk!

The entrances that were closed stiff opened up consecutively.

“Mm.”

Jonathan frowned at the bright sunshine.

He took out a small glass bottle from his chest.

The expression that was warm and that of a good person had disappeared instantly.

A fierce and scary eyes.

“Get rid of him without any mistakes.”

Jonathan handed over the bottle to the guard.

The guard just bowed without saying anything and moved inside the prison.

Clunk!

The entrance closed alongside the sound of metal.

“Benjamin you stupid bastard.”

Jonathan started to curse aloud.

Then, a long shadow appeared from the sides.

“Is there a need to kill him?”

The owner of the voice was an old man starting to age.

He was an underling serving Jonathan and the butler of the Chase family, Chandler Hoose.

“Don’t speak of what you don’t know. It’s not one or two things he’s messed up. If he says that he would keep his hereditary title, even I would be in danger.”

“Well, it’s something Count Lancephil is cautious about.”

The chandler slowly nodded.

Jonathan’s expression stiffened.

“Io Lancephil. Who was the bastard that old man got interested in?”

“He’s called Roan.”

He replied with a short answer.

Jonathan moved his feet and spit on the ground.

“Roan. Thoroughly investigate into that bastard.”

“He’s merely a commoner and a troop commander.”

At the chandler’s words, Jonathan stopped walking.

He turned to look at the chandler and said in a fierce voice.

“Benjamin Doyle was done in by that mere troop commander commoner? On top of that, his merits and rumors aren’t normal. I’m also bothered that he’s got the interest of Io Lancephil.”

By then, the chandler could only step back.

“I understand. I will thoroughly investigate like you said.”

Only then did Jonathan start to walk again.

You could feel his annoyance in each of his steps.

‘Io Lancephil.’

Ududuk.

He ground his teeth.

‘As you cut down one of my men, I’ll also do the same for you.’

The adversary was his political enemy and a rival of another family, Io Lancephil.

He didn’t think at all to let it pass.

The wind that started to blow in the eastern region of the kingdom also blew in the capital of Miller.

It was a cooler and sharper wind than the wind of winter.

*****

Roan and Chris held hands and asked how they had been for quite a while.

“I have been a bit late because I was befriending the orcs of the southern region in Byron kingdom.”

“You’ve really worked hard.”

Roan appreciated Chris’s hard work.

Because of Chris, he could finish the tedious war faster than what he thought.

“From now on, I will proceed with the work of the agency.”

At Chris’s words, Roan nodded.

They were trustable and relieving words.

“For now, I’m planning to establish a point near the region of Tale.”

At Roan’s words, Chris shook his head.

“I think it would be better to wait a bit more for that.”

It was composed, but had some expectations in his expression.

Roan saw Chris’s face and tilted his head.

Chris smiled faintly and said.

“By now, the trial of Benjamin Doyle is occurring in the capital of Miller.”

“Ah…..”

A low exclamation came out of Roan’s mouth.

Chris continued saying.

“It seems like with the help of Count Lancephil and corps commander Tate, everything Benjamin messed up is coming out. The chances of his title of nobility being deprived is high.”

At those words, Roan nodded.

He had kind of expected that part.

“On top of that, there’s a report saying that the reason Byron kingdom retreated is because of your plan.”

“Huh?”

Roan had a surprised expression.

He bitterly smiled and shook his head.

“That’s something you worked hard to do. It’s not my merits.”

“That’s not right.”

Chris hurriedly shook his hands.

“I just did as you ordered me to do so.”

He smiled brightly and continued saying.

“Anyways, if Benjamin gets his title deprived and your merits get reevaluated, the exile can become a bit lighter.”

Lighter.

It was only that.

Even if it was an unreasonable and stupid order, when he resorted to violence, Benjamin was still a noble.

Because of that, it wouldn’t happen that Roan would be completely withdrawn from the exile.

But there were high probabilities of his penalty being lowered.

Chris’s voice became low.

“With that condition, Count Lancephil has given the opinion of getting you in charge of the region of Tale.”

Right now, Io had given the punishment with the authority as a Count.

But if it proceeded as Io’s will, Roan would get his punishment decreased by the orders of the royal palace, and formally get appointed to the subjugation of the monsters of the Tale region.

Also, he would become free in deciding the entrance and the coming and going of the region of Tale.

But of course, he couldn’t do anything about him being labeled as a sinner until it was completely pardoned.

“If only that happens, won’t it be good to move your agency’s headquarters all the way to this region?”

There was no need to put it in a nearby region.

“For now it would be best to check the situation.”

“Yes. That would be good.”

At Roan’s words, Chris nodded.

Roan fell into his thoughts for a moment.

‘Establishing an alchemist guild, the head office of Chris’s office, and the offices for each branch in the region of Tale is the most beneficial thing…….’

He had already planned to establish a force in the region of Tale anyways.

On top of that.

‘The end of the southern region of Tale meets with Poskein lake.’

Although there was quite some distance with the village of Perr, where Daiv was located at, it was the most suitable place to enter Poskein lake after this.

Roan ended his thoughts and looked at Chris.

“Good. For now, let’s wait until a decision is made in the capital. But before that….”

Just because of that, he couldn’t just wait while sucking his fingers.

He calmly told Chris all the plans he had set up until now.

Chris hurriedly started to write down notes at the plans that were more complex than what he thought.

And among them, there obviously was the investment on the five merchants, the investment in Daiv and the sailors association, and the gathering of alchemists and other skilled people.

“Oh, how is mister Ford’s progress in the mining industry?”

The only one that kept failing consecutively among the five was Ford.

Chris smiled faintly and replied.

“Fortunately, he did discover a small metal mine. The size isn’t that big but as the abilities and skills are good, there’s more production than the other mines.”

“He certainly was a person with talent.”

Chris nodded at Roan’s words.

“Yes. He’s someone that will become big if he only finds a proper and a big mine.”

“Then……”

Roan said as if he was whispering and said.

“There’s a mountain called Montea in the western part of Count Lancephil’s territory. It’s a mountain that no one has put their hands on yet.”

“Montea mountain……”

Chris noted it down meticulously.

“Buy mining rights with the jewels I gave you.”

“It seems like there’s something over there?”

Chris asked with a nervous expression.

‘There’s a magic stone mine over there.’

It was a mine that would be discovered three years from now .

He clearly remembered it as it was news that could make the entire continent tremble.

‘But of course, I don’t know the exact location…..’

Finding the exact location was Ford’s job.

Roan forcefully hid his emotions and shrugged his shoulders.

“Even I don’t know that. I only heard that several miners wanted to mine in it once.”

This was the truth.

But of course, it wasn’t because they were certain or anything.

Wanting to try, thinking of maybe, that was the bigger side.

“Then, I think that quite a lot of miners should already have tried.”

These were Chris’s words.

Roan shook his head.

“No. That’s not true. Because the Lancephil family doesn’t sell mining rights.”

And it wasn’t only for Montea mountain.

Excluding three or four mountains that were in the territory of the Lancephil family, they didn’t sell mining rights at all.

Because there was no need to mine anymore and in the first place, they weren’t interested in that part.

“Ah……”

A low exclamation came out of Chris’s mouth.

Roan took out a small envelope from his chest.

“It’s a letter i’m sending to Count Lancephil. It’s a kind of recommendation letter. Take that and go find the count.”

“You’re telling me to go and convince him.”

“Yes. If it’s you, you will be able to do it.”

No, precisely speaking, the convincing finished with Roan’s letter.

If it was Roan who Io appreciated, he would send the mining rights without problems.

On top of that, there were also other contents written in it.

‘There are more reasons as to why we have to develop Montea mountain.’

Several things happen in the Lancephil family five years from now on.

And one of them is the territory battle with Count Chase, who was located at their west.

One year after this battle occurred.

A change happens in the Lancephil family.

‘If it’s Count Lancephil, he would understand the contents very well.’

Roan wrote that they should raise a fortress with Montea castle as the center.

He also included the reason why they should build a fortress and the things that would happen after that day.

Because he didn’t know how the future would change.

For now, he could only prepare for that.

‘If our side is the one to build the fortress…….’

The gathering of skilled people would lighten up.

The scale of this was getting bigger.

‘We are in a time where we slowly need more geniuses.’

The geniuses that were still hidden would start to appear.

Roan clearly remembered their existences.

‘If it gets remitted and the entrance to the region is allowed, I have to find the hidden existences.’

But that wasn’t all.

‘What’s as important as that is raising those people myself.’

He also had to slowly focus on the education of his troop members.

“Whew.”

A long sigh came out on its own.

There were just too many things he had to do.

But because of that, it wasn’t that he was annoyed.

Rather, his entire body heated up.

He had a feeling that he was accomplishing things.

‘Let’s work harder.’

Now was the time to work more earnestly.

Roan looked at Chris and extended his hand.

“Mister Chris. I will be asking of you.”

“Yes. I will do my best.”

Chris grabbed his hand and bowed.

The papers he was holding was felt heavily.

The notes written down meticulously.

Chris was really amazed.

‘If troop commander Roan’s plans all succeed…….’

He would be able to establish a more solid base than anyone.

Chris took in a deep breath.

‘He’s not someone to just end as a troop commander, or as a corps commander.’

His heart beat.

‘The best thing I did since I was born…….’

Chris raised his head and looked at Roan.

The hand he was holding felt hard and warm.

‘Was grabbing troop commander Roan’s hands.’

A smile appeared on his face.

He wanted to run to Lancephil’s territory right away.

He wanted to do anything for Roan.

“Then. I will see you later.”

Chris bid his farewell and left to the castle.

And Roan also returned to his HQ.

The two people waited for the judgement to be laid down in the capital of Miller and they did their best in their jobs.

And five days flowed by like that.

Chapter 87





The station was a distinctive spring.

Wind blew over the camp.

Flock!

The high flag fluttered with strength.

Amaranth

Amaranth troop was marching below the flag.

And the one leading at the front was Roan.

His armor was really wore down because of the continuous subjugations and battles that happened over the past five days.

But the eyes shining below the helmet were clearer and deeper than before.

“You have done well!”

“Hurray Amaranth troop!”

As they entered the camp, the troop members who were standing guard shouted cheers.

The morale was as high as if it would poke the sky.

“Troop commander.”

The centurion (hundred man commander) Semi, who was guarding the camp while the troop was away, approached.

‘Huh?’

Roan opened his eyes roundly.

Because he saw a familiar face behind Semi.

‘Baron Hape?’

A middle aged man with neat and tidy clothes.

He was a retainer of the Lancephil family, Jerom Hape.

Because he came once per two weeks to provide them with food and provisions, he was familiar with Roan.

Semil said in a low voice.

“Baron Hape has come. But it’s not because of the supplies.”

He spoke in a voice that was a little excited.

Roan slowly nodded and bowed towards Jerom.

“Baron Hape.”

He exchanged light greetings.

“Troop commander Roan. You came just now.”

Jerom brightly smiled and grabbed Roan’s hands.

Greetings came and went for a short while.

“Troop commander Roan.”

Jerom’s voice became lower.

He had a faint smile.

“Receive this.”

He took out an envelope from his chest.

A high class paper.

Roan carefully tore open the envelope and took out the letter inside of it.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation flowed out.

His eyes stopped on one sentence.

<I’m naming troop commander Roan of the 2nd rose troop who was exiled to Tale region as the vanguard of the subjugation of the monsters.>

The letter he had waited for five months.

It was a letter that informed him of his remission.

‘It seems like the situation finally concluded.’

Roan heard about the situation in the capital of Miller through the staff of Chris’s agency.

‘As Benjamin died in prison, the final judgement was suspended.’

No, it wasn’t merely a suspension.

But rather, the situation took a great turn.

The atmosphere of having to reevaluate Roan’s merits and remit him from his exile turned into a situation of inquiring about the conspiracy theory behind Benjamin’s death.

Even when Io paid attention to laying down the final judgement, the nobles showed more interest in other stories.

In the end, it took five months until he received the judgement of remission.

Roan breathed out a long breath.

‘Anyways, the results are better than what I thought.’

In Roan’s situation, there was nothing bad.

Although he still was a sinner, compared to the exile situation, he became a lot more free.

‘Is it the real start.’

His mouth slightly rose.

He bowed towards Jerom for now.

“Much thanks.”

“Hahaha. What did I do? Thanks anyways.”

“I will cleanly subjugate the monsters in the region of Tale.”

Roan said it as if he was determined and then looked towards Semi.

The troop members had already gathered behind him.

Roan looked at the members with a nervous expression and put on a faint smile.

Because he thought of another thing that was written in the letter.

“Count Lancephil has forgiven the sins of all those soldiers who received the punishment by him.”

“Re, really?”

Semi and the ex-Sollum troop members had surprised expressions and asked back.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded.

“Right. You’re not sinners anymore.”

“Ah……”

Semi and the others let out low exclamations.

Originally, they were soldiers that belonged to a troop in the Lancephil territory but were punished because they made small and large mistakes.

Originally, there were even sinners that were exiled from other places but the ones that didn’t belong to the camp had already died.

“Ah! Only now do I feel my chest clear up!”

“Damn! Am I also a common resident now?”

“Kuk! It feels good!”

Cheers poured up from everywhere.

Roan looked at that for a moment and then cleared his throat.

“Hm!”

The troop members shut their mouths like it was all a lie.

However, they couldn’t hide their happiness.

Roan smiled faintly and continued saying.

“The soldiers that want to, can return to Pavor castle.”

As soon as he finished saying that.

“Troop commander!”

“What do you mean?”

The expressions of Semi and Sollum’s troop members stiffened.

And the happy look also disappeared.

They shook their heads with an angry expression.

“Return to Pavor castle?”

“Don’t say such things.”

Their voices became bigger every time.

Semi took in a deep breath.

“Troop commander. We……”

He continued saying after he looked at the soldiers at his back once.

“Are of Amaranth troop.”

Everyone’s expressions turned red.

The soldiers yelled with all their strength.

“We aren’t going anywhere!”

“We will remain here!”

They shouted with composed voices and expressions.

But of course, there were some that stepped back and wanted to return to Pavor castle.

But they were the minority.

‘If we return, we will get treated as returnees anyways.’

‘Patrolling the castle is tedious and boring.’

‘Tch! I don’t want to return to where those helpless bastards are.’

In the first place, the members of the Sollum troop didn’t have normal temperaments.

Because of that, they could keep guarding the Tale region even after they were punished.

If they were normal people, they would have thrown down everything and become farmers.

“Mmm.”

Roan had a satisfied look at the ex-Sollum troop.

He became surprised at the reactions that weren’t expected.

It had only been five months since Sollum troop joined them.

Roan thought that they would choose the safe Pavor castle instead of one of the most dangerous places, the region of Tale.

But most of them chose to remain here.

It felt like Roan’s actions until now had proven to be correct.

A feeling that the spirit of the members were poured into his entire body.

He brightly smiled and nodded.

“I’m glad. I also didn’t want to lose outstanding soldiers.”

What Roan wanted to see was this.

Pressing down with strength and make them submit through rank, power, and honor was an easy thing.

However Roan didn’t want to increase his force through that method.

‘I’m gaining their hearts.’

He wanted to make the contents and not the shell to be at his side.

‘At least I made the feelings of Amaranth troop to be mine.’

He felt moved.

The wind blew past him.

‘Then, shall I start earnestly?’

He received the commision and the troop members also became one.

Only work remained now.

‘The first is certainly…….’

Many plans were drawn before his eyes.

And Chris’s agency was at the top of that.

‘I have to establish an agency.’

It was now time to become proper eyes and ears for Amaranth troop.

Roan clenched his fists tightly.

His eyes moved to the north, where Pavor castle was located.

*****

An earnest change started to occur in the region of Tale.

Chris’s agency, the alchemists guild, and the associations of skilled people entered the region.

As it started on a small scale, the migration ended only after one month.

“We are finally together.”

Chris sat facing Roan and tilted his tea cup.

And Chris also smiled while remembering the past.

“Many things really have happened.”

Until now, quite a few things had happened.

In the first place, he whose dream was running a travel agency, opened his eyes in gathering and analyzing information and roamed the entire kingdom.

He had also roamed the battlefield and even entered enemy territory.

His life had changed entirely after meeting Roan.

‘He’s my top benefactor.’

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“I’m thinking of moving more earnestly from now on.”

“Earnestly…..”

“I will leave your travel agency separately for international uses and establish another organization that will gather and analyze information.”

“Ah……”

Chris let out a low exclamation.

Even so, it was something he had pondered about.

He couldn’t keep running the information agency in a size this small.

“I’m planning to call the group “Agens”. What do you think?”

“Agens…….Good.”

Chris smiled faintly and nodded.

Roan kept speaking.

“You’d be the head of Agens. From now on, you will have to be the ear and eyes for our Amaranth troop.”

“Yes. I will do my best.”

Chris clenched his fists with a resolute expression.

After that, conversations about the operation of Agens continued for a while.

It was decided that the members of Agens would learn basic martial arts and stamina training and get a more organized system.

“Agens will work as an affiliate of Amaranth troop.”

“Yes. I understand.”

Chris took in a deep breath.

Magnificence kept surging up.

Roan saw that and extended his right hand.

“Let’s keep working hard.”

Chris hesitated for a moment and then said with a careful expression.

“Troop commander Roan.”

He had a kind of serious and solemn expression.

“Agens has now formally became an affiliate of Amaranth troop. From now on, please speak comfortably.”

“Ah……”

Roan nodded with a low exclamation.

Because he realized Chris’s intentions.

‘Right. We can’t maintain this relationship forever.’

Chris’s relationship was different with the other members.

As they each started in different situations, they became accustomed to speaking formally to each other.

However, now that Agens became part of Amaranth troop, there was a need to clearly differentiate the ranks.

“Fine. From now on, I will speak comfortably.”

“Yes. That’s the right thing to do.”

Chris brightly smiled and bowed.

In the first place, Chris received Roan’s help when he established his agency.

And after that, most of the inversions were provided by Roan.

Chris’s agency was just like Roan’s.

There was no displeasure or rejection about the ranks of superiority.

‘Rather, I feel more secure now that a branch was formed.’

Roan’s voice was heard.

“Then. Let’s work hard from now on.”

“I will do my best.”

The two people smiled while looking at each other.

Like this, the best information agency in the continent in his past life took its first step.

*****

Tang! Tang! Tang!

Hammering sounds were heard.

A wide plain spread out at the south of Amaranth troop’s HQ.

Tens of houses were being made in the place that didn’t have humans in it because of the frequent appearance of the monsters.

“Is there a need to go up to this point?”

Austin had an uneasy expression.

On the other side, there was a faint smile on Roan’s face who was watching the houses being built.

“The Tale region becomes more fertile the more we go to the south. We can’t just let this good soil go to waste.”

“I do know that. But compared to the north, the south has many more monsters appearing in it. Will people move to this dangerous place?”

Austin let out a short sigh.

The smile in Roan’s mouth became even denser.

“We have to make it so they do want to move.”

A composed voice and with strength replied back.

‘I have to make the residents in the north migrate to the south.’

Although the Tale region was one of the most dangerous ones and an exiled place, it wasn’t like it didn’t have residents at all.

With the permission of the Lancephil family, about 2,000 people were placed to live in a comparatively safe zone located at the north.

It was a measure to provide supplies and for the comfort of the ex-Sollum troop, who protected the region and subjugated the monsters.

‘Because there’s a limit with the supplies given by the count’s family.’

The residents of this region gave some of the harvested crops to the troop and made a living like that.

Even in that situation where life wasn’t easy and you didn’t know where monsters could appear, the residents didn’t leave the region of Tale.

‘Because the Lancephil family exempted them from taxes.’

Tang! Tang! Tang!

The sound of hammers became clearer.

The ones building the houses were the carpenters belonging to the artisans associations.

And they were also really uneasy when they first moved over to the region of Tale.

But after they realized that the surroundings were safer than what they had thought because of the subjugation of Amaranth troop, they became a bit relaxed.

On top of that, they started to build tens of houses according to Roan’s plans and gained quite the good profits.

Roan looked at the construction and fell into his thoughts.

‘I will build the houses first and make the rent to have no compensation to the ones that decide to move over. On top of that, I’m stationing two companies (hundred men squads) over here.’

These were the methods to make the residents of the north migrate to the south.

The establishment of houses was one of the main businesses of gold master Sale, in his past life.

Normal commoners made their own houses with their own hands.

But this was a difficult thing and lasted longer than what they thought.

Because of that, commoners just raised up a wall roughly so it didn’t collapse and covered it with weeds and branches to make a roof so rain didn’t leak in.

They were really sloppy shaped houses.

If a strong wind blew, the roofs would get blown up and the walls would crumble.

And everytime that happened, they had to repair it or make a new one.

In this situation, gold master Sale made tens of units to build houses and started a business that consisted of lending it instead of a certain rent.

Roan was planning to use Sale’s house business.

‘I will provide them with a house a lot better than what they are living in right now.’

It certainly was a condition they would get charmed by.

‘On top of that, if they are farmers, they won’t ignore the fertile grounds of the south.’

If only security was assured to some degree, they would come running immediately and start farming.

‘For now, I will have to meet the residents of the north.’

He was planning to meet them, reveal his plans, and convince them.

But of course, he didn’t think of forcefully making them move.

“Austin. Keep guard thoroughly and protect the carpenters.”

At those words, Austin , who was looking at the situation, made a short salute.

“Sir. Don’t worry about here.”

He had a reliable look.

Roan slightly bowed and mounted his horse.

As he pulled the reins, the horse turned to the north.

“Hiyat!”

As he kicked the horse, it started to ride with strength.

Dudududu.

Horse clops were heard along with a white dust that rose up.

Roan stuck his chest to the saddle and took in a deep breath.

Then, he saw black smoke surging up consecutively.

At that moment Roan’s face stiffened.

He knew what the identity of the smoke was.

‘Beacon?’

Chapter 88




Sponsored chapter

Although the region of Tale was one of the most dangerous places, just looking at its size, it wasn’t that big.

Even with the farthest place, that was Poskein lake that was at the south, it took a quarter of a day to reach it.

Because of that, if they could only grasp the appearance and movement of the monsters quickly, they could subjugate them perfectly without suffering that many losses.

That’s why the beacon was made.

With the HQ at the center, the beacons were lined up in a long fashion to the four cardinal points, and thanks to that, they could quickly realize that monsters had appeared.

‘Not the east, west, and south but the north?’

Roan kicked his horse and frowned.

The north was the region where people resided.

Because of that, it was the place where they had to subjugate more perfectly than other places.

And actually during the past five months, monsters appeared only three times in the north.

But even so, they were perfectly annihilated before they reached near the village.

Dudududu.

The sound of horse steps was heard clearly.

You could see the HQ from far away.

The entrance, that was closed stiff, opened up as if they were waiting for them.

The guard had discovered Roan coming closer.

“What happened?!”

Roan yelled with all of his strength as soon as he entered the camp.

One of the centurions, Ant, came running quickly.

“Looking at the order the beacons were fired off, it seems like monsters are moving from the southeast to the northwest.”

He replied with an urgent voice and expression.

‘Monsters from the south going to the north?’

Roan frowned.

There was no reason for the monsters to move to the north, that was well guarded.

‘Has it already started?’

Roan could think of a reason for it.

He put more strength in his hands that were grabbing the reins.

“And the centurions?”

“Just like we trained recently, Semi, Tane, and Pete each lead their companies and marched! Even centurion Harrison, who was patrolling in the north, would have moved after seeing the beacon.”

“Good. Then, I’m entrusting the HQ to you!”

“Yes. Don’t worry!”

Ant made a short salute.

Roan hurriedly turned the head of his horse.

And soon, the cavalry appeared.

Their numbers were merely 50.

However, they were the best among the best in Amaranth troop.

“We are moving quickly towards the village in the north! Don’t fall behind!”

“Yes! Understood!”

At Roan’s orders, the cavalrymen replied in one voice and kicked their horses.

The chest that moved closely to the saddle.

The fifty cavalrymen ran while splitting the air with Roan at the front.

Their destination was the village in the north.

It was the place that still hadn’t fired up the beacon.

*****

Hans, who was exactly 60 this year, lived a life filled with despair.

The stories tell that he was born as a vassal of a wicked and stupid noble family, lived on while being pressured, and exploited and became a vagabond at the age of 49.

He was wandering in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom and then became a vassal of the Lancephil family thanks to Io’s consideration.

He was placed in a barren land in the northern region with people with similar circumstances as him, but he couldn’t live calmly at all because the people of Byron kingdom invaded without stop.

Then, he heard the notices that the Lancephil family was selecting people to immigrate to the region of Tale.

On top of that, he even heard that they were going to exempt them from taxes and provide them some money for the settlement.

The foreigner Hans, who didn’t even know what kind of place the region of Tale was, applied for it, and got elected.

That was when he was 53 years old.

Hans migrated to the northern region of Tale along with 3,000 people.

Only then did he realize that the region of Tale was heaven for monsters, but he believed in the territory guards that were settled in together with them.

But merely after two years that they settled in, thousands of residents and most of the guards lost their lives.

The region of Tale was really heaven for monsters and hell for humans.

Most of the surviving people trembled in fear and left the region of Tale.

However, Hans stayed in place until the end.

This was because the support and the tax exemption was too sweet.

‘Even if I return to where I originally lived, it’s obvious that I will die at the hands of the Byron bastards.’

If he was going to die like this and like that, it was more profitable to stay in the region of Tale.

Fortunately, the Lancephil family provided soldiers consistently.

They even sent knights and soldiers to the north of Tale and subjugated the monsters.

Seven years has passed like that.

The number of the residents repeatedly increased and decreased and now they maintained a number of 2,000.

Although the number of the guards that first amounted to 3,000 was now 800, the north of Tale was quite the safe place.

Monsters didn’t appear that often and even if they did, they were close to the troop’s HQ so it didn’t turn into become a dangerous situation.

Thanks to that, three big and small villages set place following the boundary of the north.

And the village that was created first and had the most number of people was this place, the place was called the village of the north.

Hans was now enjoying his old and stable life as the chief of the village.

“Huh?”

Hans, who was taking some air at the high watchtower, frowned.

A middle aged man was running towards him in an urgent manner.

‘Liss the herbman?’

Liss was someone that wandered around the safe places of the village and harvested good quality herbs.

He shook his arms with an urgent expression and movements.

‘What’s happening?’

As he paid more attention, he thought that he was yelling something. However, he couldn’t hear well because of the distance.

Only after the distance was closed did Liss’s words become clearly heard.

“Monster group! Monsters have appeared!”

At that moment, Hans’s expression stiffened.

‘Monster?! Why monsters so suddenly…….’

He almost hadn’t seen any monsters recently.

He first calmed down his surprised heart and then yelled towards the guards that were at the watch tower.

“Ring the bell! There are monsters!”

“Ye, yes! Understood!”

The guards nodded with a surprised expression.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

Soon, the sounds of the bell were heard clearly.

As Liss entered the village, the gates that were open, closed quickly.

Soon, Hans got down the watchtower asked with an urgent expression.

“You said monsters? Is that true?”

“Pant. Pant. It’s true. It is.”

Liss calmed down his breath and barely started talking.

“I was harvesting some herbs near the village and then saw a dust cloud surging up.”

His voice trembled.

“I wondered what was happening and climbed to the peak of a mountain and then saw a group of monsters that were approaching with a black color.”

“Black?”

Hans asked back after he dry gulped.

Liss just nodded several times instead of replying.

Meanwhile, the villages people gathered around.

“Wh, what’s happening?”

“Chief. Did something happen?”

Everyone had expressions filled with worry.

Hans frowned.

‘Monsters are coming in a black group?’

His sight moved over to the high fences covering the village.

‘They were called Amaranth troop.’

This was the troop that was working instead of the Sollum troop to guard the region and subjugate the monsters.

Five months ago, the members of Amaranth troop sought the village and built an even higher fence and a watch tower inside of it.

‘Will we be able to hold on?’

There were about 100 guards inside the village.

‘No. It’s impossible.’

Although they had the newly build fence and the watch tower, it was impossible to handle the black group of monsters approaching them.

‘To the south, it’s better to escape to the south.’

When he thought up to there.

“Chief!”

The guards in the watchtower yelled in one voice.

A yell closer to despair.

Hans frowned and then moved up to the watchtower.

“Ah…….”

A low exclamation came out of his lips.

And that was an exclamation mixed with fear and discouragement.

“What happened?”

“What is happening!”

The villages people yelled.

Hans looked outside the village while gritting his teeth.

‘There’s at least 2,000 of them.’

Just like Liss’s words, the group was pitch black.

And moved faster than thought.

White dust surged over them.

‘It’s impossible to escape.’

Going out of the village now was tantamount to suicide.

‘A fortress!’

They could only face the monsters inside the village.

He remembered the young troop commander of Amaranth troop he had met quite some time ago.

‘Was he called Roan.’

He was a really well mannered and confident youth.

‘Did he say that the defensive system of the north was perfect…..’

Expression and attitude filled with confidence.

That look was still fresh.

‘In the end, we can only wait and believe in the Amaranth troop.’

They could only hope for that perfect defense system to be of great strength for them.

Hans yelled below the watchtower.

“Prepare for battle! Move the women and children to the inner parts of the village and the guards and men all come up to the watchtower!”

He took in a breath for a moment and then continued saying.

“Monsters are charging in.”

At that moment, a heavy silence fell onto the villagemen.

An unexpected thing came out of his mouth.

They were kind of relaxed because monsters hadn’t appeared until now.

Then.

“Kyaa!”

The yell of a young girl broke the silence.

“Ah! Hu, hurry!”

“Quickly!”

That was the start.

The residents moved quickly.

Although there was no control, they were residents of Tale.

Hans also hurriedly sent the order.

“Gather rocks and prepare hot water.”

“Yes? Ah, yes!”

The vice chief and the head of the guards, Carl, replied with an urgent expression and got down the watchtower.

Hans just stood still and watched the monsters.

The bastards were just lining up without any formations.

Kuang!

A cry was heard following the wind.

Although he tried to forcefully act calm, dry saliva was gulped down unconsciously.

Meanwhile, the guards and the men took place in the watch tower.

They raised the bows and arrows Amaranth troop provided them with and aimed at the monsters.

Gulp.

Their adam’s apples shook severely.

Although they did stand up on the watchtower to protect their families, they couldn’t do anything about feeling nervous.

As they saw the 2,000 monsters, their knees shook and became short of breath.

But even so, they couldn’t escape.

‘We protect our village ourselves.’

Everyone ground their teeth.

Then.

Wooooo!

The monsters let out cries and started to charge.

As 2,000 monsters kicked the ground at the same time, white dust rose up.

They closed the distance in an instant.

At that moment, several arrows were poured down from the watchtower.

Sweeeee!

A sharp sound rang out.

But they, who didn’t have proper training in the bow, couldn’t put strength behind it.

Pubububuk.

Most of the arrows were stuck in the ground.

Kieek!

Monsters charged to the fences along with their cries.

“Fire arrows! Throw the rocks!”

Hans yelled with all his strength.

The guards used all their strength to throw rocks and fire arrows.

However, they couldn’t stop the advance of the monsters.

They soon moved closer to the fences.

‘Ca, can’t we block them?’

‘Is it the end?’

Everyone was thinking with expressions full of despair.

“Huh?”

“Uh?”

Sweeeeee!

Sharp sounds were heard.

At the same time, a dense shadow appeared before their eyes.

It was a darkness that seemed to cover the clouds.

Hans and the villagers raised their heads to look at the sky.

“Ah!”

A low exclamation came out of everyone’s mouths.

‘Arrows!’

At that moment.

Pubububuk.

A rain of arrows poured over the monsters.

“Kieeeeek!”

“Kuek!”

The monsters, who were running towards the village with good spirit, started to fall.

They started to become porcupines one by one.

At the same time, the sound of the horn trumpet was heard beyond the monsters.

Puuuuuuu!

It was a sound that made their chests boil.

White dust rose up.

A troop flag surged up from the back of the monsters.

<Amaranth.>

Hans saw that and said with a moved expression.

“It’s Amaranth! The Amaranth troop appeared!”

Despair filled with joy.

The villagers that were half absent-minded at the sudden situation yelled only then.

“Waaaaaaa!”

“Amaranth troop! Hooray!”

An amazing shout exploded out from them.

Hans took in a deep breath and covered his face with his two hands.

As his nervousness disappeared, his two legs trembled and tears started to pour out.

‘Ho, how could they come this fast?’

The herbman Liss had discovered the monsters and came running just now.

But Amaranth troop, who should be at the HQ, had already appeared.

Hans wiped off his tears with the back of his hand and looked at the troop flag.

‘There really was the perfect defense system troop commander Roan talked about.’

He became excited for nothing.

Then, a group in the rear started charging in while pushing back the monsters.

It was a really fierce charge.

It was Roan and the 50 cavalrymen.

Behind him, the infantry company followed him.

Tung! Tudung! Tung!

“Kuek!”

“Kek!”

At the charge of the warhorses, the small sized monsters were bounced off to the sides.

The cavalrymen and infantry took that opportunity and they made their spears dance.

Slash! Spat!

Horrible sounds were heard with the heads of the monsters falling to the ground.

Paat!

Finally, Roan and the troop members perfectly pierced through the monsters and stood at the entrance of the village.

Roan was fully covered with the blood of the monsters.

He raised his head for a moment and looked at the people on the watch tower.

“Ah……”

The villagers let out a low exclamation.

They saw the faint smile on Roan’s mouth.

The uneasiness that remained in a corner of their hearts completely disappeared.

Roan turned the head of the horse again and looked at the monsters.

He had a scary look.

His lips were shut.

Behind him, the soldiers took formation and organized themselves.

Roan took in a deep breath.

The smell of the fierce battlefield entered deep into the lungs.

The lips that were tightly shut started to move.

Soon, a rather low and strong order fell out.

“Annihilate.”

Chapter 89




The ghost of the battlefield.

That was the nickname given to Roan during the subjugation in the Pedian plains.

But the nickname back then was given because he accurately found the monster nests. Not because of his overwhelming and powerful strength and abilities.

A ghost that was a fortuneteller.

However, the Roan right now, he really resembled an amazing ghost.

Spat!

The Travias spear split the air.

Because of the Flamdor mana technique, mana of white light flowed in the spear.

Slash! Stab!

“Kuek!”

“Kek!”

The cries of the monsters became mixed with the terrible noises.

Every time Travias spear moved once, several monsters fell.

It was a spear drawing a line.

Blood flowed from the traces.

Paat!

The blood boiled the air of the battlefield.

At Roan’s hand movements, the flagman moved his flags quickly.

Flutter! Flutter!

Followed by that, sounds of the horn trumpet and drums were heard.

Puuuuuu! Dun! Dun! Dun!

Four centurion squads that were spread in a rectangular shape pressed down the monsters.

Amaranth troop outclassed them by far in both spirit and force.

But the numbers of the monsters were more than double.

The battle became fiercer than what they thought.

“Injured ones to the back! Quickly fill in the collapsed formations!”

Roan yelled with all his strength at the front.

Each centurions operated some squads of ten in an organic shape.

It was a strange and weird movement.

Amaranth troop resembled a living being.

“If we fall, the village falls.”

Roan yell aloud.

He had a determined expression.

He put more strength in his hands.

And that was the same for the members of the Amaranth troop.

They had clearly grasped the nature and thoughts Roan had while roaming the battlefield with him.

‘We are protecting the villagers.’

‘They’re people we must protect.’

The troop members took in a deep breath.

The number of the monsters was still more than a thousand.

Roan and the troop members glared at them coldly.

In this situation, they couldn’t hope for luck.

Strength vs strength.

They needed a frontal victory.

“Charge!”

“Uaaaaaa!”

As Amaranth troop started the charge, the monsters also kicked the ground.

“Chwee!”

“Kek!”

The front of each side collided.

A great battle unfolded in front of the village.

Spat!

Roan’s spear danced and drew a line.

*****

“Whew.”

A long breath flowed out.

Roan was standing in the middle of the battlefield.

‘Did it end?’

It was fierce.

So much so that it could be considered the fiercest battle since he returned to the past.

The surroundings were filled with the corpses of monsters.

Blood flowed through his armor, spear, and helmet.

“There aren’t any monsters alive.”

“The monsters were exterminated.”

Semi and the several centurions approached and saluted.

They all looked terrible.

However, a faint excitement and pride was shown on their faces.

“Retrieve the corpses of the soldiers that died in battle and heal the injured ones.”

“Yes! Understood.”

At Roan’s orders, the centurions replied with strength and scattered to the sides.

Soon, the troop members started to move quickly according to their orders.

Roan looked at that for a moment and then went to the entrance of the village.

Kiiiiiik!

The closed gates started to open as if it was waiting for him.

You could see Hans and the villagers from the opened crack.

Everyone had moved expressions.

Roan roughly shook off the blood on his armor and stood in front of the villagers.

“I’m troop commander Roan of the Amaranth troop.”

He said with his head lightly bowing.

At that moment, Hans and the others also bowed.

“Oh my. Tha, thank you!”

“We were able to keep our lives thanks to you.”

“Much thanks.”

At that look, Roan had a faint smile.

It gave off a somewhat lonesome feeling.

“I’m glad everyone’s safe.”

It was true.

He was glad that the people, the village, was safe.

However.

‘More troop members died and became injured than what I had initially thought.’

This was the fate of a soldier.

They were the ones that would end up dying while protecting what they had to.

‘I mustn’t forget their deaths.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

Then, Hans stood to the front and spoke in a low voice; almost as if he was whispering.

“How did you realize so quickly and come here?”

Roan faintly smiled and explained about the patrolling system and the beacons in a simple manner.

Hans, who was listening to it, nodded with an amazed expression.

‘He really has a perfect defensive system.’

The more he saw him the more he felt reliable and trustworthy.

“Ah……”

Then he saw the soldiers retrieving the corpses of the fallen soldiers behind Roan.

At that instant, Hans’s expression turned dark.

“It seems like many soldiers died because of us………It seems like you suffered a really big loss for a village that wouldn’t matter if it even existed.”

Hans looked at the villagers closely.

Just how much strength did the Amaranth troop put in protecting the village?

They couldn’t forget their pathetic looks.

The villagers gathered both of their hands to their chests and slightly bowed.

Roan shook his head at that look.

“Our role is protecting your life and well being.”

There was strength in his voice.

“We are no different from a family.”

Roan looked at the faces of Hans and the villagers.

“I, and our Amaranth troop never forget about family.”

Even if he was powerful and rich, he wouldn’t be able to live on as a monarch throwing away his citizens.

‘That’s a real monarch.’

This was one of the principles of the monarch he thought that a monarch required and one of the most important things.

That was the loving feeling towards his citizens.

“Ah…..”

Hans and the villagers let out low exclamations.

‘I knew that he was a fine person……’

When Roan first came to the village while leading Amaranth troop.

When they built an even higher and sturdier fence and even built a watchtower.

When they subjugated the monsters one step ahead.

By then, they had already felt that Roan was different from the ordinary commanders until now.

However, they didn’t know that he was a person with such a big plate that he would even put his life on the line to protect the lives of the commoners.

Hans knew the reason as to why the troop members moved without any hesitation at Roan’s orders.

‘If it’s him, they can trust and follow him.’

Because it was to the point that even he felt like that.

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“Chief. I have something to tell you in private.”

He spoke with a careful expression and words different from before.

Hans nodded.

“Yes. Let’s go to our house.”

He was the benefactor of his life.

He was planning to listen to him in whatever he said.

Hans walked in front and Roan followed him.

As they moved inside the fence, they saw an old and shabby but clean village.

The kids were looking at him with eyes filled with curiosity.

The ladies pulled those kids into their embrace.

It was a really peaceful scenery.

‘I did well in protecting them while putting my life on the line.’

He wanted to protect this small and simple happiness.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘To keep protecting this happiness……..’

There was a need to migrate the villagers to a new place, the south.

But now, it wasn’t simply to harvest the rich soil.

‘The monsters migrating to the north was ahead of the timetable that I thought.’

Roan knew the reason why the monsters were moving to the north.

‘There’s not much left for the exodus of Poskein lake.’

The lights in his eyes sank down calmly.

The Poskein exodus.

It was a strange phenomenon that was revealed only after a really long time even in his past life.

“Whew.”

Roan took a long sigh and shook his head.

‘I’ll have to hurry up a bit more.’

It was now time to whip on the running horse.

For Roan, Poskein’s exodus was a danger and an opportunity.

‘And to turn the danger into an opportunity……..’

Several plans flowed down in his head.

A red light shined in his clear and deep eyes.

*****

The exodus of Poskein lake.

After the war between Rinse and Byron kingdom, the continent folded in a period of safety for a moment.

The kingdoms that waged war concentrated on cleaning it up, and the ones that didn’t wage war focused on their livings.

At that moment.

Monsters started to pour out from Poskein lake to the ground.

The four kingdoms surrounding Poskein lake couldn’t act properly at the sudden phenomenon and because of that, the region near the lake ended up getting destroyed.

The four kingdoms mobilized their forces late and went up to subjugate the monsters, and only after three months of war could they exterminate all of their enemies.

The four kingdoms that were each estranged with each other started to work together in this opportunity.

At first, the investigation team researched the reason why the monsters started to pour out to the ground so suddenly.

However, even after spending eight years on it, they couldn’t reveal any clear reasons.

Then Ferb, who was the librarian from the kingdom of Estia’s library, found out one interesting thing.

And it was that in a historical book that was in a romero in the library, the ‘continental movement’ was mentioned several times. Written in it, the ‘continental movement’ mentioned about the monsters from Poskein Lake pouring out into the land.

Although there wasn’t any specific reason written in it, things about the omens were recorded in detail.

And one of the omens was that the water of Poskein lake, that was supposed to provide water to the soil of the Istel kingdom’s ground, started to flow out into the sea through a passage; making the harvest decrease. Also, it mentioned that an unknown disease would spread rampantly.

The next omen was that the monsters near Poskein lake moved to the sides to get further away from the lake.

The romero was recording this phenomenon of Poskein lake as the ‘Poskin exodus’.

Only then did the research teams of the four kingdoms realize that the decrease in harvests of the Istel kingdom and the unknown movements of the monsters were all due to the Poskein exodus.

‘Even the monsters in the region of Tale started to move to the north, evading Poskein lake in the south.’

It meant that there wasn’t much time left until the exodus.

‘The disturbance of the monsters will become more severe every time.’

As a result, the northern Tale region wasn’t a safe place anymore.

If the three villages were scattered like this, there was a high probability in giving serious burdens to the defense system.

‘It’s safer to migrate them to a new village.’

The village that was being developed in the south had a proper defense and headquarters where the centurion squads could stay at.

In the position of the villagers, rather than entrusting their lives to a sloppy fence, watch tower, and inexperienced guards, it was safer to migrate to a new village.

And even if that place was closer to Poskein lake.

“Chief. What I want to tell you today is related to migration.”

Right after he finished saying that, Han’s face became solid.

“Do, do you want to kick us out?”

He had an uneasy expression.

At those words, Roan smiled faintly and shook his head.

“No. We want to migrate the residents in the north to the south.”

“To the south?”

These were words that he hadn’t thought would come out at all.

Roan slowly nodded.

“Yes. To the south.”

He explained for a long while the reasons why they should migrate to the south in great detail.

The fertile ground, houses provided with no compensation, a safe defensive system.

And at the end he emphasized that the northern region would stop being a safe zone because of the commotion of the monsters.

But of course, he didn’t talk about the Poskein exodus.

“Mmm……”

Hans fell into his thoughts while he shut his mouth.

He couldn’t decide this alone.

“For now, I will consult with the villagers.”

“Yes. Talk and debate the time you need and decide. And if perhaps……”

Roan paused the last words for a moment and continued speaking.

“It would be better to leave the region of Tale momentarily for the ones that don’t want to migrate to the south.”

“Is it because of the disturbance of the monsters?”

Hans asked carefully.

And Roan slowly nodded.

“Yes. The disturbance would probably become fiercer the more time passes. But there’s a limit in the defensive system of our troop. It’s impossible to guard all three villages set up in the northern region.”

“Right.”

Hans smiled bitterly.

He took in a deep breath and looked at Roan.

“For now, I will speak with the villages.”

“Yes. Then, I will be waiting for good news.”

Roan stood up from his seat.

The things he had to do here had ended.

‘For now, I’ll have to wait for the decision of the people and go subjugate some monsters.’

He was planning to sweep up everything he could before the Poskein lake exodus occurred.

‘For now, I’ll have to go find the alchemists and blacksmiths.’

He had many things to do.

He had to build and test the several weapons and tools being developed before the exodus.

And it was also time to move Daiv and the sailor alliance that was expanding in force in the village of Perr.

‘I need to do it one by one.’

Roan clenched his fists.

He already had some kind of a base.

And now was time to raise an axis and build a house.

And it was time to protect that house.

Establishing a base (4) End

Chapter 90




Alchemists researched while they hid themselves deep in the forest or in a secluded room.

It was a necessary branch for the production of weapons and items.

At first glance, it really was an important job.

Because of that, it seemed as if it was treated quite nicely but actually it wasn’t like that.

First, in the cases of alchemists, you had to spend quite a lot of money for the research and the results were poor and in the process of the research mishaps and small accidents happened in consection.

On top of this, alchemy was labeled as the skills of the devil and the distance between them and the magicians and priests became wider; the rank of alchemists reached the lowest levels.

The reason why blacksmiths, carpenters, and etc were treated more contemptuously was much simpler.

The kingdoms of this era didn’t hold the people that worked while doing manual labor in high regards. (E/N: Welcome to the world.)

They were considered stupid bastards that only knew how to move their hands.

This was the thoughts of the nobles and powerful people.

Thanks to that, the several branches couldn’t get treated well and were exploited with manual labor.

In that situation, Roan promised a safe lodging and constant investments while gathering skilled people. So soon after, quite the number of people gathered.

They built houses near the HQ of the Amaranth troop and settled in, but there were no quiet days.

“I wonder. It’s like that because that’s not it. We have to put twenty more steel pieces!”

“If we do that, the durability decreases and only the weight increases!”

“Just believe in me and do it once.”

“Do you think I was deceived by those words once or twice? Hmph.”

It was a hot workshop.

Two people that gave completely different impressions were raising their voices.

The middle aged man with white skin was Oden.

He was an alchemist that specialized in the combination of minerals.

The middle aged man facing Oden was another middle aged man with a red face, called Biggs.

He was considered to be one of the best blacksmiths.

The two people were following Roan’s orders to make a lighter but stronger weapon and were combining forces.

The problem was that their thoughts were too different and that the clashing of opinions was too severe.

“But you don’t know, so try it once! You just have to do what I tell you to do!”

“If you want to do it that much then do it yourself!”

Their voices became louder.

The surrounding blacksmiths clicked their tongues and shook their heads.

Then, a shadow appeared at the entrance.

“Huh?!”

The surrounding blacksmiths bowed with surprised expressions.

“Troop commander Roan!”

The person that entered through the entrance was none other than Roan.

After he returned from the village of the north, he went to find some blacksmiths.

‘They’re also hard working today.’

Roan looked at Oden and Biggs and smiled.

Although it seemed like they would hit each other at any moment, he knew that they were actually sharing their opinions.

‘I was also taken back by them at first.’

He had cold sweat trying to calm them down.

But it didn’t mean that the fierce quarrel disappeared just because he did that.

In the end, he just let them be and little by little, results started to come in.

‘After they fight like they would kill each other, they fix things up while drinking alcohol.’

The two people were a good match for each other.

“Oden. Biggs.”

Roan moved his feet and called the two of them.

“Ah! Troop commander.”

“Troop commander. Have you come?”

Although Roan was much younger than them, their ranks were clear.

The two people belonged to the alliance of alchemists and skilled people but in the first place, they were an institution belonging to a branch of the Amaranth troop.

“You’re also very fierce today.”

At those words, the two people scratched their heads as if they were embarrassed.

Roan looked around the workshop and continued saying.

“It’s close to the time where we have to start preparing. What happened with what I asked of you last time?”

He spoke in a soft voice but filled with strength.

Biggs opened his two eyes roundly.

“Ah! The new product is out.”

They hurriedly moved to the inner part of the workshop and then took out a shapeless armor and a round shield.

The armor was quite ordinary and the shield had a size to barely be able to cover your upper body; it was even thin.

The two of them were of a black color and had a smooth texture.

“We did make it as you told us for now, but will the size of this shield be of any use?”

It meant that it was too small.

If you covered your head, it revealed all of your body, and if you curled up to protect your body, it revealed your abdomen and the lower parts.

Roan made an eye sign as if it was fine.

“Ahem.”

Biggs put on the armor and shield while clearing his throat.

The shield was well fixed on his left wrist.

“Now, look.”

Biggs moved his body everywhere with a nervous expression.

He showed movements of swinging the shield and blocking and then moved his arm behind his back.

Then.

Click.

The shield took place on his back with the sound of a metal click.

Behind him, a hanger on his back interlocked firmly with a hanger on the insides of the shield.

Biggs turned back and showed his back.

“Just like you said, we made the shield so it could be attachable. Although it’s gonna be quite difficult before becoming proficient. Even I’m failing six out of ten times.”

He extended his arm again and moved the shield sideways.

Click.

The hangers loosened up with the sound of a metal click and the shield separated.

Biggs took posture once more and lowered his stance.

“And lastly……..”

His right hand hid behind the shield.

Srung!

A nice feeling sound of metal rang out.

At the same time, a small sword the size of a forearm appeared.

“We hid one small sword.”

The demonstrations ended.

Roan nodded and clapped.

“Amazing.”

His mouth rose up.

‘It’s a bit different to what Ian Phillips designed but if it’s this much, it’s still amazing.’

The use of a small shield and the small sword.

It was one of the parts the genius strategist Ian focused on experimenting with.

‘When others were developing a longer spear, a heavier sword, an arrow that could be fired farther, Ian focused on developing a short weapon that was light yet strong.’

Thanks to that, the Rinse kingdom could show an overwhelming strength in close combat.

‘If on top of this I can also combine the weapons of the other continents and kingdoms……..’

The strongest troop in history could be born.

But there was one unfortunate thing.

‘I just vaguely know the shape. I don’t know with what principles, ingredients, or methods those things were made with.’

Those things were parts that the alchemists and blacksmiths had to fill in.

And because of that, he had gathered them faster than anyone and wasn’t petty on the budget.

“First, you will have to mass produce that shield.”

“Yes. I understand.”

Biggs hit his shield with his right hand as if it was no problem at all.

Roan smiled satisfactorily and nodded.

“Thank you everyone for following such an unreasonable order.”

Right before he finished saying that, Owen shook both of his hands.

“We are rather thankful for letting us research as much as we want.”

“Yes. It’s the first time we were treated like this since we were born.”

Biggs followed up.

Roan slightly bowed towards those people.

He wasn’t simply investing on them.

Roan and the Amaranth troop members treated and respected them in a human way.

“Let’s keep working hard.”

At Roan’s words, Oden and Biggs clenched their fists.

“Believe in us!”

They spoke with confident expressions and voices.

Roan of the Amaranth troop, Oden of the alchemists guilds, and Biggs of the skilled people association.

The three people looked at each other and smiled.

*****

“That’s not it. The angle that you’re stepping in is wrong.”

Roan’s voice rang out in the training ground.

Amaranth troop members were quite nervous.

They swung their spear while they stood in a firm line.

Pat!

Every time the spear split the air, a sharp sound was heard.

‘They certainly are have a difficult time.’

Roan was teaching Roan’s spearmanship to the spearmen.

And he even taught the infantry, cavalry men, and archers some separate things he knew.

Although the level of it was low compared to his spearmanship, even so it was a must to teach to the normal soldiers.

‘I’m selecting new squad commanders based on the merits until now and their progress in training.’

Still water becomes foul. (E/N: I think he’s saying something about stagnation leads to demise.)

Roan wanted to make a system that could promote anyone to a higher rank if they only had the abilities and capabilities to do so.

‘A reasonable and fair competition develops everyone.’

But even so, he didn’t think of throwing away the soldiers that fell behind.

He was planning to teach them separately while putting in a little bit more of effort.

He was using the carrot and stick method at the same time. (E/N: Or in our case at kobato, carrot and whip ahahahaha.)

“Your spear fell! Put more strength in your arms!”

Roan yelled one more time with all his strength.

He could kind of see that the entire troop was becoming stronger.

Then, one man appeared at the entrance of the training ground.

It was a really familiar face.

‘Pens.’

He was Chris’s right hand and the vice president of the agency.

Roan entrusted Austin with the training and moved over to him.

“Pens.”

“Troop commander.”

Pens lightly saluted and put on a smile.

Roan patted his shoulders and went towards his office.

“Is Chris well?”

“Yes. He’s really busy right now.”

Pens brightly smiled and replied.

Roan had an awkward smile.

“I feel sorry for him.”

It was Roan that asked him things that took too much effort.

But Pens shook his head.

“No. He’s having a lot of fun right now.”

“I’m glad then.”

Roan let out a short sigh and then moved inside his office.

Pens took out a thick pile of papers as if he was waiting for it.

It was the gathered and analyzed information centered in the eastern region of Rinse kingdom.

Roan lightly looked at it and then looked at Pens.

“Anything in particular?”

“That…..”

Pens hesitated for a moment and then continued saying.

“I’m talking about Montea mountain.”

If it’s Montea mountain, it was the mountain they bought the mining rights through the orders of Roan.

“Even so, we think it was in vain.”

They had roamed several places in the mountain for five months but they didn’t discover any mines or minerals.

Roan asked back with a composed expression.

“What are the thoughts of the others?”

“For now chief Chris and the staff of our agency all judge that it was in vain. But….”

Pens paused for a moment and then said in a low voice.

“The responsible one, Mister Ford, seems to think in another way. He says he’s getting a feeling. He says that there certainly is something in Montea mountain……..”

“Something?”

Roan copied his words.

Pens smiled bitterly.

“He’s asking to increase the budget. To dig deeper…..”

Just by looking at the situation, it was no different than a helpless proposal.

But Roan, who knew that there was an incredible sized magic stone mine, had a proud smile.

‘Ford. He’s a friend with quite good senses.’

Roan hit the end of the table with his fingers.

“Good. Tell Chris to increase the budget.”

“Yes?”

Pens asked back with a surprised expression.

He said in an urgent voice.

“With the current situation, we can’t have that much leisure. The jewels you have given us have already been invested in the agency of Amaranth troop, the Fishermen Association, the Alchemist Guild, the Blacksmith Guild, and the five businesses. The income of our side is the income coming in from the four businesses excluding the mining one…….”

Just maintaining the current situation was tight.

And Roan also knew about that situation quite well.

“It’s fine. We will be lessening the income to Amaranth troop momentarily.”

Still, he spoke with a composed voice and expression.

But his eyes were filled with certainty.

“Invest in Mister Ford. He will soon show some accomplishments.”

The decision had been made.

Pens took in a deep breath and bowed.

“Yes. I understand.”

“And tell Mr. Daiv of the Fishermen Association to prepare to move out.”

“Prepare to move?”

At Roan’s words, Pens tilted his head.

“Yeah. I’m planning to make a port in the lake after subjugating the monsters of the south.”

His eyes shined.

“Ah…”

Pens let out a low exclamation.

He knew from way before that Roan showed big interest in Poskein lake.

“I will tell him that.”

Pens wrote down the contents thoroughly.

Roan stood up from his seat.

Although he wanted to have a meal with Pens, he didn’t have the leisure right now.

“Next time, let’s have a drink together.”

“Yes. I will be waiting for you.”

Roan and Pens grabbed their hands.

A strong heat was felt between them.

Then.

Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!

The sound of the bell was heard from the HQ.

Jiing! Jiing! Jiing!

Followed by that, the heavy sound of the jing was heard.

Bell and jing.

It was a sign alarming about the appearance of monsters.

“I, is it monsters?”

Pens asked back with a slightly nervous expression.

Roan just nodded and then opened the door.

At that moment, the wind came in.

That was the wind of the boiling spirit.

“Sir! We have finished preparations to charge out!”

Austin saluted and bowed.

“Ah……”

Pens opened his eyes roundly.

He let out an exclamation after seeing the firm and solid formation in front of his eyes.

‘I heard the sound of the bell just now but they have already finished preparations……’

He had never seen a troop moving this well until now.

But the expressions of Roan and the Amaranth troop were composed and calm.

Roan hurriedly mounted his horse and grabbed Travias spear.

Cheng!

The metal stick transformed into a long spear along with the sound of metal.

“Monsters from the southeast are moving to the northwest!”

This was Austin’s report.

Roan nodded shortly afterwards and looked at the troop members.

The tightly shut lips and eyes could be seen on his face.

They were already the strong among the strong.

“Amaranth troop!”

Roan raised the Travias spear he was holding in his right hand highly.

“March!”

Chapter 91




Kiiiig.

The tightly closed gates opened up.

Amaranth troop entered the HQ with Roan at the front.

‘The battle is a victory.’

Roan raised his head and looked at the sky.

The sky was filled with black clouds and was dark.

“Whew.”

He let out a long sigh.

Roan’s feelings right now was just like that dark and black sky.

He turned his head to look at his Amaranth troop.

The battle was certainly a victory.

However.

‘The more the battle continues, the more injured soldiers appear and some even die.’

The soldiers were completely exhausted at the continued battles.

‘The size of the troop is too small.’

In the first place, Amaranth troop absorbed Sollum troop and started with 800 people.

Thinking about the scale of the monsters in the region of Tale, it was at a level where it was lacking too much.

He wanted to massively increase the numbers of the troop members.

However.

‘The number of residents in Tale is too small.’

It wasn’t a situation where he could increase the number of soldiers himself.

‘Although I can dispatch the soldiers of the Lancephil family….’

But in that case, another troop would be placed in the region.

It was a situation where a stifling problem could occur.

‘I have to find other methods.’

Roan looked at the faces of the centurions.

“The centurions are to grasp the number of injured ones and dead ones and gather to the conference room.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Austin, Semi, and the other centurions replied in one voice and then they each moved to their own squads and disappeared.

Roan just looked at that.

‘Mm.’

He saw the looks of the injured soldiers.

A bitter feeling rose up.

‘If we just had a shaman, it could have been of help in healing them.’

But there was no way a shaman would be dispatched into this barren land.

‘I have to at least set the weight of healing clearly.’

It was a problem concerning the lives of the soldiers.

Roan thought of several stifling things and then moved.

The place he was moving to was the office of the agency.

There was something he had to check before the conference.

‘It would be nice if we had a bit more time before the Poskein exodus.’

His steps became faster.

An earnest flame appeared in his two eyes.

*****

“There aren’t as many fallen soldiers as we had thought.”

“And the injuries ones are mostly ordinary.”

The reports of the centurions followed.

The battles were certainly complete victories and there was a small number of dead soldiers.

But the expressions of Roan and the centurions were dark.

Austin hesitated a moment and then opened his mouth.

“We are certainly winning several battles and the number of dead soldiers and injured soldiers is low. But at most there are two or three battles occurring in a day. The injuries are accumulating while not knowing that they are getting wet by the drizzle.”

Semi followed.

“And the exhaustion of the soldiers is at a dangerous level. If we keep this up, the morale will dive down.”

Roan just nodded.

He also had the same thoughts as them.

“Isn’t there a good method?”

At Roan’s question, everyone closed their mouths.

However it wasn’t because they didn’t have any methods to propose.

It was because they were all difficult methods so they couldn’t say it.

Roan looked at the faces of the centurions and said.

“What about bringing residents of the other regions?”

With no need of going far, there were quite a lot of residents wandering about in the territory of Count Chase.

On top of that, most of the wandering people moved in families.

If they were provided with land to farm and a house, they would be able to bring at least one adult son into the troop.

‘After the Poskein exodus concludes, we will have to increase the number of residents anyways.’

Taking that into account, bringing in residents of the other territories was the most effective.

But.

“We don’t know if it’s a small scaled one, but a huge scaled one won’t be even worth talking about.”

“The nobles and lords won’t just watch them leave.”

Several skeptical voices were heard.

Even so, as Roan started by saying his thoughts, the other centurions also started to say their own thoughts.

Semi scratched the tip of the table and said.

“How about buying slaves? If we tell them that they can become normal residents they will fight quite valiantly.”

Tane, who was listening to it, shook his head.

“We don’t have the leisure to do that right now.”

Most of the troop’s income was being invested in Ford’s mining business.

Then, Pete said with a rough voice.

“How about making a deal with mercenaries? After war ends, they won’t have a lot of jobs so we would be able to use them with quite the small amount of money.”

At those words several centurions nodded.

But Austin had his doubts.

“Anyways, we still need quite the sum of money for the mercenaries. On top of that, if we bring them to our troop, the morale will drop and there’s a high chance that the balance would become a mess.”

It was the truth.

It was frequent for the rough and free mercenaries to make everything messy.

‘Mercenaries are just like double edged blades.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘If you used them well they become a big weapon, but if you make a mistake then they can cut your hand.’

And really deeply at that.

The conference continued but a clear method couldn’t be thought up.

And the pondering deepened like that.

Then.

“Um……..”

The one that barely talked was Harrison.

He was the youngest centurion and the one with the least amount of experience.

He looked at his surroundings and carefully said.

“How about asking for a favor from the Lancephil family?”

At those words, Semi shook his head with a stiff face.

“If the soldiers of Count Lancephil come, then the weight of commanding is shifted to him and it rather becomes more comp……”

“No, what I mean……”

Harrison shook his hands and interrupted him.

He looked at Roan and said.

“How about bringing in residents of Count Lancephil’s territory?”

“Ah……”

The centurions let out low exclamations.

And that was the same for Roan.

‘As it’s a migration inside his territory, there wouldn’t be any problems.’

In the territory of Lancephil, there weren’t as many wandering people compared to other places.

Because of that, they had to migrate residents from several regions.

But even so, it was a much easier method than bringing in wandering people of other territories.

Only, they needed Io’s permission.

‘For now, I will have to send him a letter.’

If there was even a little bit of successful possibilities, they had to try it.

‘I’m also trying the other methods.’

Buying slaves, migrating people from the other territories, contracting with mercenaries.

Although you didn’t know if it would succeed or not, it was better to try many things.

His head was spinning from this.

“The centurions are to combine all the opinions and proceed to do it.”

Roan looked at the faces of the centurions.

“Centurions, take care of the health and the morale of your members.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Austin, Semi, and the others all bowed.

Roan clenched his fists.

“It will be a difficult time. But our Amaranth troop…….”

Strength was put into his voice.

“Never gives up.”

The centurions swallowed dry saliva and bowed.

There was a resolute look in their faces.

‘Let’s trust in troop commander.’

Their loyalty and the loyalty of the troop members was absolute.

‘Whatever trial comes, if we have troop commander Roan we would be able to overcome it all.’

A strange heat roamed in the conference room.

And that was the hot military discipline.

*****

First, Roan wrote a letter for Io.

Contents about the migration of residents and the increase in the number of his troop members were written in it.

At the same time he ordered the staff of the agency, working in the eastern region, to buy slaves, form a contract with mercenaries and push forward the migration of other regions as secretly as possible.

As they still didn’t have financial leisure, the speed of it wasn’t that fast.

But Roan was still satisfied with just that.

Because the situation was improving and getting better even if it was by a little bit.

Puk!

Roan’s fist crushed the trunk of a tree.

“Whew.”

A long sigh came out.

The surrounding was a real mess.

The trees composing the woods that couldn’t stand the hits and kicks, collapsed.

Roan focused on training in Reid’s battle techniques in a forest near the troop.

‘Troop training is important, but I can’t slack in my own personal training.’

He was taking care of many things at once, so he didn’t have time for personal training.

Although he still was training in the Flamdor mana technique, Roan’s spearmanship and the several techniques he remembered in his head, he had kind of neglected in the technique that made Reid the strongest person on earth.

It was partly because he had never encountered the technique itself, but also because the level of the technique was just too high and with Roan’s current level, there were several parts that were difficult to understand.

‘Although it’s still impossible to execute a perfect technique……..’

Even when he had just learned the basics of the movements, flow, operation of the mana technique, he became much stronger than before.

The movements transformed to have no unnecessary movements, the mana in his body became smoother, and he was able to operate it much faster.

‘The level of the operation is at the level of a knight?’

The level of Roan’s mana grew exponentially after the past overflowing of his mana.

He passed the level of an apprentice or a basic knight and arrived at the level of an intermediate knight.

But the strength of his actual mana was at the level of a superior knight.

The Flamdor mana technique was that amazing.

‘If I can train a bit more in it, I could emanate an aura.’

It wouldn’t just be covering his spear in mana, but he would be able to condense his mana to emanate an aura.

If he could only do that, there wouldn’t be anyone able to match Roan in terms of the level of mana excluding the knights of the royal palace.

Only.

‘There’s no spear technique able to bring out the strength of this aura properly.’

Roan’s original spear technique was Pierce’s spearmanship used by normal soldiers who didn’t have mana.

Because of that, he felt regret that it couldn’t maximize the strength of an aura.

‘This is the reason why I have to focus on training in Reid’s battle techniques.’

It was the only martial arts that could let him display the real strength of his mana.

Roan took in a deep breath and clenched his fists.

Pubububuk!

Five fists followed.

Boom!

The tree that was holding on finally collapsed.

As he shook his hands, pieces of wood fell.

Then, something entered Roan’s sight.

‘Mm?’

As he focused on his sight, he saw the scenery that was far away as if it was in front of his eyes.

‘Troop?’

A troop was approaching the HQ.

He could see the symbol on the flag that was at the front.

It was a really familiar symbol.

‘Lancephil family?’

It was an unexpected entrance.

‘It should be before the letter reached him.’

Roan tilted his head and moved.

The HQ was right in front of him.

The guard, who confirmed the flag of the Lancephil family, rang the bell.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

Right before he entered the HQ, Austin and Semi came running.

Austin made a short salute and opened his mouth.

“It’s the flag of the Lancephil family.”

Roan nodded slowly instead of replying back.

“What will it be so suddenly?”

Semi asked back with an expression full of curiosity.

But even Roan had nothing to say.

He took in a deep breath and then gave the order.

“Let’s prepare to welcome the guests.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Austin and Semi answered in one voice.

The two people moved busily with the soldiers.

Thanks to that, the preparations finished faster than what they thought.

The centurions and troop members arrived behind Roan.

It was an overwhelming sight.

He saw the flag of the Lancephil family through the open gates.

‘Ah………’

At that moment, Roan let out a low exclamation.

Below the flag.

The person at the front leading the group.

He was really familiar.

Roan let out a short sigh.

‘Count Lancephil.’

A smile appeared on his face.

The person appearing with the flag of the Lancephil family.

It was none other than Io Lancephil.

*****

“The setting sun in the region of Tale has a different feeling.”

Io looked at the western sky while holding his luggage on his back.

A red sunset was spread out following the mountains.

He became amazed while looking at the high and solid fences and the watchtower surrounding the HQ.

“It’s a really solid and well made camp.”

At those words, Roan who was one step behind him, bowed.

“It’s an excessive complement.”

“It’s not. It’s really, really amazing.”

Io put strength in his eyes as if it was true.

Roan just smiled faintly instead of replying.

‘To have reached this point in only seven months………’

Io looked at Roan and was amazed.

‘I did well in sending him here.’

He had brought the knights and soldiers because he was touring the eastern region.

It was because the movements of the monsters in the region that was close to the lake became even more fierce.

They had visited the region of Tale after thinking of subjugating the monsters.

‘I thought that the situation would be worse……..’

Monster heaven.

Because of that, he judged that the movement of the monsters would be severe.

And even if that didn’t happen, he thought that the impoverished and shallow land would be a mess.

But Io’s thoughts completely slipped off the mark.

The region of Tale was much safer and peaceful than any other region of the east.

When Io entered with his group, he hadn’t seen even one monster in the region of Tale.

‘I wondered if it was really the region of Tale.’

Io smiled.

He looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

‘This is all thanks to Roan. Roan did something that couldn’t be done for several years in only seven months.’

Io grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“Roan.”

“Yes. Sir count.”

“Truly, thank you.”

At the sudden words, Roan became a bit perplexed.

“Wha, what are you thankful fo……”

At the staggering words, Io put on a bright smile.

“For confirming me that my eyes of looking at people weren’t wrong.”

“Ah……..”

Roan let out a low exclamation.

Io hit Roan’s shoulders and continued saying.

“While I was coming here, I received a letter.”

He took out an envelope from his chest.

It was the letter Roan had sent him through the agency.

‘Ah, they met in the middle.’

Roan had a nervous expression.

He was worried about the reaction Io would show.

But contrary to his belief, Io’s expression was really bright.

He smiled brightly without thinking much and nodded.

“I will migrate a group of residents to the region of Tale just like you wanted.”

Io looked at his surroundings and said.

“There won’t be a safer place than this, even inside my territory.”

On top of that, the exemption of taxes and providing of houses.

In the place of the residents, it was a condition that could pull them in.

“Much thanks.”

Roan bowed at the clear decision of Io.

It was a moment that a big problem was solved.

Io looked at that Roan and had a faint smile.

‘Migrate people to the region of Tale……..?’

His smile became even denser.

‘That was just what I wanted. And if perhaps Roan perfectly subjugates the monster of this region…………’

His eyes shined.

‘I will take Roan to the royal palace.’

Roan wasn’t an existence that could be left as a troop commander anymore.

Although he did commit violence against a noble and it was considered a big sin, perfectly subjugating the monsters in the region of Tale was a big enough merit to completely pardon his sins and still have some left over.

‘Roan.’

Io’s eyes became soft.

His eyes stayed on Roan’s face.

‘I will show you a completely new world. No…………’

I can show you the world, shiny shimmering splendid~

A whole new wooorld, a new fantastic point of view~ coughs

He had a feeling that his chest pounded and his blood circulated faster.

‘I will open a completely new world in front of you.’

Chapter 92

Actually Io had half given up on the Tale region.

You had to deploy quite a lot of soldiers for a long time in order to subjugate the monsters.

But in the situation where they shared borders with Byron kingdom and Istel kingdom, it wasn’t easy to deploy soldiers on a large scale.

Just blocking them so they didn’t cross into another territory was the best that they could do.

‘Even the money invested in this region was a lot.’

Operational fees for the Sollum troop, settling fees for the residents, compensation for losses, and etc. made it so that a lot of money was put into it.

But even so, there wasn’t anything that had changed for the better.

It was like pouring water into a poisonous swamp.

‘However Roan stabilized the region of Tale in only seven months.’

Actually, he did feel a bit strange.

How could he change this region of Tale, that didn’t show any changes even after years of effort, in a mere seven months?

Io didn’t know, but it was all because of Roan’s strategies and tactics.

They made the defenses of the villages more solid and set up a beacon system in the region and after that they moved faster than the monsters and exterminated them.

On top of this, he used the agency earnestly to find the nests of the monsters and attacked them.

It was completely different to the passive and defensive Sollum troop.

“Let’s keep working hard from now on.”

At the lightly spewing words, Roan saluted.

“Leave it to me.”

He had a confident voice and expression.

And in actuality, Roan was indeed confident.

If people migrated and the number of residents increased, he would be able to subjugate the monsters more quickly.

‘I have to end it before the exodus starts.’

When the Poskein exodus started, he would have to concentrate all of his strength over there.

Roan clenched his fists.

‘I can do it.’

It was a feeling that all of his stifling situations were solved quickly.

Then.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!

The sound of drums and the jing was heard.

“What’s this sound?”

Io asked back with a strange look.

And Roan lightly bowed.

“It seems like a beacon has been triggered. It means that monsters have appeared.”

“Ah……..”

Io let out a low exclamation.

Roan saluted like that.

“I will prepare to march out.”

“Ah, right. Go quickly.”

Io nodded late.

Roan moved away after that.

Quick movements.

Io looked at his back and had a proud expression.

‘He’s reliable.’

He felt really secure.

Io raised his head and looked at the sky.

The sky that was black even until the afternoon, it was now bright and clear.

It gave off the feeling that it cleared up your chest.

“The sky is really nice.”

Io’s voice flowed with the wind.

*****

“So he’s looking for mercenaries, right?”

“Not only that. Although it’s small scaled, it seems like he’s also buying slaves.”

The person that was talking as if he was whispering was the chandler of the Chase family, Hoose.

“Hmph!”

He had a displeased look.

The man that snorted was Count Jonathan chase.

“He was subjugating the monsters in the region of Tale successfully?”

“Yes. According to the reports coming up every day, it seems like he has made up some remarkable accomplishments.”

“He really is a pain in the ass kind of bastard.”

Jonathan chewed his lower lip.

Bang!

He smacked down on the table and then made a gesture to the chandler.

The chandler approached with a nervous expression.

“If we leave him be like this, he will become the main underling of that bastard Io.”

At Jonathan’s words, the chandler just nodded.

“On top of that, looking at how the situation is turning there’s a high possibility that his sin gets completely pardoned.”

Jonathan’s voice became a bit low.

A fierce light appeared in his eyes.

“It’s good to thoroughly step on a leaf that has the possibilities.”

The chandler still kept on nodding.

Jonathan said in a whispering voice.

“Make a fake mercenary group with bright guys and send them to that bastard. I will have to plant some spies.”

“Ah……..”

The chandler let out a low exclamation.

Jonathan touched his chin with one hand and put on a fishy smile.

“Make them perform great and to grab his attention. Make them obtain his trust and get important roles and become the underlings for that bastard. And Roan, if that bastard gets to enter below Io then…… Kuku.”

A strange laugh came out.

Several plans were formed in his head.

The chandler looked at that look for a moment and then shook his head.

“Then, I will go to prepare as you ordered me to.”

He moved his feet and left the room.

Jonathan, who was left alone, crossed his arms and had a weird smile.

‘Io. I will make the roots slowly rot.’

His chest kept heaving up.

This was an excitement that he couldn’t control.

Bang!

Jonathan smacked the table once again as if it was a habit.

His entire palm became numb.

And the smile in his face became even more dense.

*****

The subjugation of the monsters was proceeding as planned.

Roan and the Amaranth troop started to push back the monsters of the southeast as if they were hunting them.

Although the monsters fled from the lake to the north, they were hopelessly exterminated by the troop that was already waiting for them.

Because of that, Amaranth troop could face the monsters more easily than before.

“I can see Poskein lake.”

Austin pointed at the front and yelled.

Roan’s mouth slightly rose.

‘We finally came up to here.’

They still hadn’t completely secured the southern region.

However, there was a need to take over the lake sooner rather than later.

‘We have to move over the Sailor Association.’

Roan wasn’t thinking of simply waiting for the monsters until the Poskein exodus occurred.

‘On the contrary, we will charge over to the lake.’

Poskein lake had several islands in it, deserving of it’s huge size.

Roan was glaring at Exos island among them, located at the center of the lake.

‘I’m going to use Exos island as the port and control the whole central part.’

If it happened just like his plans, he would be able to secure a safe port and use it as the base.

“Austin.”

“Yes, commander.”

At Roan’s call, Austin approached and bowed.

“We are going to set up a camp. I’m going to build a village here.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Austin hadn’t showed a weird look or questioned him, he just replied back.

For him, Roan’s orders were absolute.

Soon, Austin and the centurions started to set up a camp near the lake.

Roan looked at that for a moment and then turned the head of his horse.

‘I’m entrusting this place to Austin.’

Roan and the remaining troop members had something separate to do.

‘I have to check the villages built south of the HQ.’

Fortunately, Hans and the villagers all moved to the south at Roan’s offer.

But of course, it wasn’t that all the villagers had migrated.

‘Originally, I wanted to evacuate the remaining people outside of the Tale region…….’

But now, there was no need to.

Because thousands of new people migrated at Io’s order.

Roan settled them in a village to the north and established a new troop with the adult men as the selected ones.

But there was absolutely no coercion.

If the situation turned difficult he would have to resort to force, but there was no need to do that right now.

Because he offered quite an exceptional deal, quite a lot of men volunteered to get into the troop.

Roan put on a minimum condition of checking them thoroughly through a test and that only the ones that qualified could enter the troop.

And that number was close to 1000.

It was a number that was enough to create a new troop.

‘But even so, I can’t deploy them into battle.’

Roan made a new training ground near the HQ and trained the newcomers.

And surprisingly enough, the one in charge of the training was Glenn.

‘If it’s Glenn with his meticulous personality, I thought that he was going to be able to teach the newcomers well………’

And Roan’s judgement hit right on the mark.

Glenn performed more outstandingly than what he had predicted.

It was seen as if he had talent in teaching others.

‘When the size of the troop becomes bigger than now, I will have to entrust him with the training grounds altogether.’

Roan’s mouth rose up.

The migration of people and reinforcements for his troop.

The establishing of new villages.

Everything was getting solved to help with his plan.

‘On top of that, I now have some leisure………’

It was thanks to Io migrating the residents and providing him with funds.

In the position of Io, all the money he was pouring went all to Roan and the troop, so he didn’t have any burdens at all.

‘Now……’

Roan looked at the ground.

The bulky ground that was spread out as it wanted.

‘Is it time to set up a main road?’

Building a road in all of the Tale region was impossible.

‘I’m making a highway with the HQ as the center to all the four cardinal points. We will be able to move quicker only by connecting the villages.’

If only that happened, even if the Poskein exodus occurred, he would be able to respond to it more actively.

Roan took in a deep breath.

‘I have to increase the number of alchemists and skilled people.’

As construction were being done in several places, they lacked in workers.

And the more time passed, the more difficult it became.

But it wasn’t hard at all.

Rather, he felt more of happiness.

‘And end spearman ended up becoming the chief of a territory.’

Although his rank was merely troop commander and on top of that a sinner because of committing violence against a noble, if he just blocked this exodus well enough, he could aim for an even higher place.

‘I can do it.’

Roan clenched his two fists.

A red light shone in his eyes.

The sky was still clear without any clouds.

It just seemed like it was predicting Roan’s upcoming days.

*****

“One! Two! Three!”

“Hap! Hap!”

Loud noises rumbled out.

Hundreds of soldiers were training in the training ground.

“Again! You’re doing it again!”

The one yelling in front of them was Glenn.

His usual look of being soft and gentle had completely disappeared.

His eyes were fierce and his attitude was confident.

‘He’s a completely different person when teaching newcomers.’

Roan, who was looking at him from the back, had a faint smile.

Roan had free time for the first time in a long while and came to the training grounds where the newcomers were at.

They all had shields on their backs.

‘Thanks to the blacksmiths working hard, we could fit the numbers.’

The Amaranth troop could now charge forward with just using the shield with a small sword.

At first, everyone was awkward with it, but they quickly became accustomed to it thanks to troop training and personal training.

‘As soon as this training ends, I will dispatch the newcomers to the villages.’

He couldn’t bring them into a real battle right from the start.

Right now, even one troop member was precious.

Roan checked on the training of the newcomers for a while and then slowly moved.

As he was just looking, his body felt all itchy so he couldn’t endure it anymore.

‘Do I also have to……. huh?’

His feet that were moving towards the HQ, stopped.

‘Pens?’

A welcoming expression was seen on his face.

Pens, who was at Pavor castle along with Chris, was walking from far away.

His expression was really bright.

After a while.

“Troop commander Roan.”

Pens approached and bowed.

“Pens. Why did you come all the way here?”

There were still ten days remaining to submit the regular report.

Pens brightly smiled and answered.

“Mister Ford has finally done it.”

He had an excited voice and expression.

“He has discovered a magic stone mine in the Montea mountain!”

His voice became louder.

‘Ah, he finally discovered it.’

Roan was proud, but didn’t show it.

He nodded with a calm and composed attitude.

“Good. Mister Ford will be able to put down a bit of his burden.”

“Yes? Is that all?”

Pens rather asked back with a surprised expression.

His usual calm expression had completely disappeared.

“It’s not steel or gold, but magic stones. Magic stones! Do you know how amazing of a discovery is this?”

Pens even had saliva coming out of his mouth and explained things earnestly.

Roan looked at that and smiled.

As he always saw his calm side and now saw a really excited look, he felt good.

Then.

“Troop commander!”

A familiar voice was heard from far away.

Keep was running from the direction of the HQ.

Keep was in charge of the Amaranth troop’s information squad separate from the agency.

Different from the agency that checked on the entire territory, Keep’s information squad only checked on one place.

Poskein lake.

“Pant. Pant. Pant.”

Keep caught his breath while he was grabbing his knees.

Roan didn’t hurry him and just waited.

“Tr, troop commander.”

Keep said and looked at Roan.

Roan slowly nodded meaning to speak.

Keep’s expression stiffened.

“Po, poskein lake……..”

His voice was slightly trembling.

“Poskein lake is boiling up. No……”

He swallowed down dry saliva.

“It seems like it’s boiling.”

Roan, who was listening to Keep’s words, slowly closed his eyes.

His eyes slightly trembled.

He had an expression that was kind of nervous.

‘Finally……..’

Roan clenched his fists.

‘The Poskein exodus is occurring.’

Chapter 93




Dudududu!

The sound of horse steps rang out while the ground shook.

A luxurious carriage with tens of escorting knights were charging through a long road.

“Ugh!”

“Do, dodge!”

The people walking on the road moved their bodies sideways and dodged the carriage.

Their sight naturally followed the back of the carriage moving further away.

“That’s the carriage of Duke Webster, right?”

“It is. There’s the flag on it.”

The people murmured with serious expressions.

They perfectly remembered things like the flag and symbol of a noble, just like citizens of the capital of Miller.

“Just what happened?”

“Yeah. Already more than ten carriages have entered the palace.”

“And really urgently at that.”

Their eyes, following the carriages, moved to the high palace.

There was a fear they couldn’t hide in their eyes.

The capital of Miller was covered over in a cloud of tension.

Because tens of nobles’ carriages entered the royal palace for exactly two days.

But this kind of thing had only happened once.

The invasion from the Istel and Byron kingdom.

At that time, the big noble families gathered at the palace to have a meeting.

“Is there going to be another war?”

Words you didn’t want to hear came out from someone’s mouth.

“Ei, that can’t be……”

And a denying sound was heard afterwards.

But the nervousness and fear in their eyes became even denser.

Gulp.

Their adam’s apples trembled.

The citizens looked at the palace in dead silence.

*****

Bang!

The thick door opened up abruptly.

The person that appeared was an old man wearing luxurious clothes.

He was one of the four dukes of Rinse kingdom and the person with the biggest force in the western region of Rinse kingdom, Bradley Webster.

“I was late because I was subjugating the monsters in the Grain mountain range.”

He had an urgent voice and expression.

He moved his feet and sat in an empty seat.

There were already tens of nobles seated in the huge conference room.

Bradley and the other dukes were positioned in the upper seats.

“Let’s proceed with the meeting.”

He spoke with a voice and expression that wasn’t satisfactory.

The center of the upper seats was for the representing nobles and at the top of the ranks, and in that place Duke Edwin Voisa was seated.

Edwin and Bradley didn’t seem to be on good terms.

No, precisely speaking, among the four dukes Edwin Voisa, Bradley Webster, and Liss Kowan had a relationship of being political enemies.

Only Francis Wilson maintained a good relationship with the other dukes.

And that was because of the stifling situation in the royal palace of Rinse kingdom.

The current king, Deni Von Rinse, had seven wives and he obtained one son from three of them.

Three princes.

Their grandfathers were Edwin, Bradley, and Liss.

The actual king Deni III wasn’t interested in politics and power.

On top of that, he was an improviser and fickle.

Although he wasn’t that bad of a mess, he still wasn’t an excellent king.

Compared to him, the three princes had outstanding abilities and their ambitions were also great.

As they were all born at the same time, based on the situation, anyone could become the king.

Because of that, the nobles of Rinse kingdom were currently in a battle of strength with Edwin, Bradley, and Liss at the center of it.

“Just like I told you, monsters moved onto the land from Poskein lake. It’s known that they are all strange and odd monsters and their battle strength is a bit stronger than the ground monsters.”

This was the report of a noble.

Followed by that, another noble said.

“The monsters on the ground are moving to the inner parts of the country evading the lake. Because of that, the damage caused by the monsters isn’t only occurring in the lake, but in the entire kingdom.”

Several reports followed.

Edwin, who was listening to it still, asked back with a serious expression.

“Was the cause revealed?”

The answer was quick.

“Based on the opinions of the residents near the lake, they said that the lake boiled for four days before the monsters poured out. Aside from that, there’s nothing else revealed.”

This meant that in the end, they couldn’t find the cause.

Then, Bradley who was silent, turned his head and looked at a noble near the upper seats.

“I heard that the damage in that region is insignificant…….”

An existence even a duke of the palace couldn’t speak freely.

“Yes. Fortunately, we could react quickly.”

The noble replying modestly.

He was none other than Io Lancephil.

‘This is all because of Roan.’

His mouth slightly rose up.

Actually, it was also a perplexing thing for him that monsters poured out from the lake.

But Roan, who was patrolling the region of Tale, moved quickly to set up a defensive line and block their advance.

Thanks to that, contrary to the other regions that became a wasteland, Lancephil’s territory didn’t suffer much damage.

“You said that the one that raised this clear merit was called Roan?”

Bradley continued to show interest.

Io nodded and answered.

“Yes. He’s the troop commander that was remitted to some conditions and is now in charge of the region of Tale.”

“Mmm.”

Several nobles let out low exclamations.

They also very knew clearly about the actions.

The performance of Roan and the Amaranth troop.

‘He’s defending one region without damages with only thousands of soldiers?’

‘From the subjugation of the Pedian plain, the war with the Istel and Byron kingdom, and the movement of the monsters from Poskein lake. He’s someone who I hear his name mentioned a lot recently.’

‘If only he didn’t strike a noble, by now he would be a noble himself?’

‘He was someone that had clear abilities.’

‘He is following Count Io Lancephil.’

‘If he crosses over to another side…..He would have to be removed by then.’

They all thought about similar but slightly different things.

Bradley’s expression brightened up.

“I heard that he is achieving victory alone when all of the other territories are suffering damages. Actually, now that we started talking about him, aren’t the merits he had achieved until now, amazing? By now, we will be able to completely pardon his sins and entrust him with leading an army at Poskein lake.”

This was an exception proposal.

Bradley was the one with the most affection for Io among the four dukes.

Bradley was thinking of being the strength to Io and Roan with this time’s merit.

Io bowed.

“As he has plenty of abilities, if you believe and entrust him, I……..”

When he spoke up to then.

“I don’t think it’s something to decide that urgently.”

A cold voice spoke out.

The one that interrupted him was Edwin.

‘You thought I would let you do as you pleased.’

A fierce light roamed inside his eyes.

“For now, let’s decide on how to suppress the monsters and subjugate them.”

The change of the topic.

“That would be good.”

Liss added on as if he was waiting for it.

Bradley was about to say one more thing but he decided to shut up.

If he made a mistake he could get pincer attacked and get driven to a corner.

“Now, if you have any good ideas, say it without hesitating.”

At Edwin’s words, the nobles that were aware, started to state their opinions one by one.

But when one side said an opinion, another side butted in.

A battle of force had started with the dukes as the center.

Io, who was looking at the situation, let out a short sigh.

‘Whew. It’s like this again.’

Now, the conference would become a mess because of the battle of force among the dukes.

This was the reason why they couldn’t come to a quick conclusion when the Istel and Byron kingdom invaded last time.

“We can’t do that!”

“The opinion you said right now is nonsense!”

The voices became louder.

Then.

The stiffly closed doors opened up.

“The sun of the kingdom, he’s the representative of the god Crea, His Majesty Deni III is entering. The vassals loyal to the kingdom are to show your manners.”

The Grand Chamberlain Logan Deil hit the floor three times with a huge staff.

“Your Majesty.”

“Your Majesty.”

The nobles who were arguing just now all stood up and bowed.

And that was the same for Edwin, Bradley, Liss, and Francas.

An old man moved his feet with a smiling face.

He stood at the highest seat that could control all of the conference room.

It was a seat that was adorned with gold and only the king could sit in.

“Hohoho. You’re all working hard.”

Deni III laughed.

“Is the conference proceeding well?”

It was a light asking question.

“Yes. Your majesty.”

Duke Edwin replied after stepping up and kissing the ring of Deni III.

The luxurious ring was the seal of the king and a symbol of power.

“Hohoho.”

He once again laughed.

But the laughter didn’t last long.

The expression of Deni III turned stiff just like the laugh from just now was fake.

“When I was listening outside you were all quacking like fucking geese, and a proper plan didn’t come out but it’s proceeding well?”

At the rebuke of Deni III, all of the nobles quieted down.

However, this cold rage didn’t last long.

Deni III was this type of person.

“Hohoho, that may also be politics. I understand all of your burdens.”

“We are ashamed, your majesty.”

The nobles replied in one voice.

They all had cold sweat.

Then, Deni III closed his eyes and had a funny expression.”

“That’s why I was saying, I have a good method.”

He looked at three young men that were standing at his back.

The heads of the nobles moved following Deni III’s head.

“And that method is these three princes.”

Three young people.

They were the three princes of Rinse kingdom.

Their eyes were deep and clear and they all looked really beautiful.

They were all born in the same year, but the months were different.

The one at the right of Deni III was the first, Simon Rinse. The second was the one left of Deni, Tommy Rinse, and the one next to him was Kallum Rinse, the third prince.

Simon’s grandfather was Bradley, Edwin for Tommy, and Liss for Kallum.

Deni III brightly smiled and said.

“I’m entrusting the subjugation of Poskein lake to these three princes.”

“Yes?!”

The nobles that were listening silently had surprised expressions.

Deni III continued speaking.

“The north to Simon, the central region to Tommy, and the south to Kallum.”

“Yo…, your majesty. The movements of the monsters are too fierce. At the smallest slip up, the three princes can become greatly in……”

When Edwin stood up and expressed his thoughts.

“It seems like Duke Voisa doesn’t find us to be trustworthy.”

Simon interrupted him with a comical face.

“No, I didn’t mean it that way……..”

Edwin awkwardly laughed and dimmed his last words.

Simon brightly smiled and hit his chest.

“Trust us. We are confident in doing well.”

“Yes? Ah, yes……”

Edwin had a confused expression.

Deni III, who was looking at that funnily, stood up.

“I know that the nobles split up based on following the three princes and fighting among yourselves. Let’s now stop this enmity and go to the battlefield yourselves. I will be giving a big reward to the prince that has the best merits.”

“Mmm.”

Several nobles let out exclamations.

A faint smile appeared on the mouth of Deni III.

“The seat of Grand Duke in Grain is still empty. You don’t know but what kind of influence this subjugation will have is based on the results……..”

“Ah!”

At that moment, the nobles looked at Deni III with surprised expressions.

Grand Duke of Grain.

It was the land of the god Crea and had the best mountain ranges in the kingdom.

It was the land that the successor for the throne was going to get.

Until now, Deni III has never named the takeover of the throne.

Because of that, the nobles were more than shocked.

They were all absentminded.

On the other hand, Deni III had an expression that he was somewhat enjoying this.

He looked at the faces of the nobles and then yelled towards the escorting knights.

“Let’s go! Today, we are hunting hawks!”

His walk was smooth and confident.

Deni III and the knights disappeared outside the conference room.

It really happened in an instant.

“Your majesty.”

“Your majesty.”

The nobles started to bow late and showed their manners.

A heavy silence fell over the conference room for a moment.

It was just as if a storm had passed by.

The three princes that remained in the conference room had stifled and strange expressions and looked at their faces.

‘My brothers. Let’s battle as much as we please.’

‘I have to raise a merit that’s eye catching enough.’

‘If I make a mistake, I may drop out of the competition.’

Stifling thoughts passed in their heads.

Edwin, who was looking at the situation, cleared his throat.

“Hm!”

Things have already been spilled anyways.

“Then. Just like his majesty had said, the three princes will be participating in this subjugation.”

His eyes trembled.

And that wasn’t only for Edwin.

Bradley’s and Liss’s head became complicated.

‘I have to make the situation to become the most favorable.’

‘I’m pouring in all the strength of my family.’

‘I will even have to gather the nobles that crossed a line with me.’

The atmosphere in the conference room changed.

The outward appearance was as calm as a still lake.

But below that, a fierce battle was happening.

The conference continued night after night like that.

******

‘He’s someone I can’t grasp.’

Io looked sideways to his left.

He was looking at a good looking youth riding a good war horse.

It was Simon Rinse.

‘For the prince that was advised by the king to be prince Simon among the three.’

After the conference ended, the nobles had a separate meeting with the princes they were supporting.

As Io usually followed the inheritance rule, he went to find Simon.

And of course, it was also because of his thick friendship with Bradley.

Simon revealed that it was himself that made the subjugation plan.

But of course, he had never expected that Deni III would also be providing the Grain mountain range.

‘This subjugation became the most important moment for Prince Simon.’

Even if he didn’t do so, Simon was the person that was the most supported by nobles following the inheritance rule.

If he only raised a big merit in this battle, he would have a greater advantage.

By then, no one would be able to stop Simon.

‘Fortunately……..’

Io’s expression faintly changed.

‘Prince Simon has great interest in Roan.’

Roan was a big of subject of interest even in the royal palace.

Their interest and curiosity was activated from the consecutive victories.

‘It’s also a big opportunity for Roan.’

If Roan could enter Simon’s eyes, even if Io didn’t use his hands, he would be able to get pardoned for his sins and climb to an even higher position.

“Compared to the other regions, the region of Tale is really peaceful.”

This was Simon’s voice.

He had an amazed expression.

They had passed several regions while moving from the capital of Miller to the region of Tale.

Tranquility. Silence.

Several regions were suffering severe damages because of the movement of the monsters that appeared out of Poskein lake.

But only the region of Tale was clean.

Traces of burnt monster corpses were everywhere and big and small camps sprinkled about.

On top of that, the road made of gravel and sand made it more comfortable for the soldiers to move much faster.

He had a feeling that he was getting more impressed the more he saw.

“What kind of person is this guy called Roan?”

Simon asked as if he was really curious.

“Roan……”

Io smiled faintly and started to speak stories about Roan.

“Ha! It seems like all the reports that were submitted were lacking.”

Simon was greatly amazed after listening to the stories.

He had read the reports about Roan and the region of Tale.

‘I thought that the merits and the situation of the region were exaggerated.’

But after actually looking at the region of Tale, he realized that the reports were really humble.

“I want to meet that Roan quickly.”

Io just smiled instead of replying.

Then.

“I can hear some yells.”

One of the escorting knights frowned.

The really faint sound was heard from the surroundings.

Simon tilted his ear for a moment and then nodded.

“It seems like a battle is occurring.”

A smile bloomed on his face.

He made a gesture with his head towards Io and then pulled the reins.

“Roan, I think he’s somewhere close.”

He spoke with a humorous tone.

At the same time, he kicked the horse.

Dudududu!

Soon, horse steps were heard clearly.

The escorting knights quickly followed his back.

And Io also moved his chest towards the horse.

How long had they ridden for?

As they moved up a hill, a wide plain was spread out below them.

Puuuuu!

The sound of a horn trumpet was heard.

“Ah….!”

Simon and the several knights let out low exclamations.

A battle was occurring in the plain.

No, the battle was now coming to an end.

“The entire troop is moving like one.”

Amazement.

Simon looked at the soldiers pushing back the monsters fiercely and had a surprised expression.

Io, who arrived late, looked down the hill and put on a smile.

“They are the Amaranth troop.”

Chapter 94




A sponsored chapter to make your day

“Mmm.”

Simon and the knights nodded with in exclamation.

‘It’s a more outstanding troop than what I had thought and heard.’

Even so, Simon and the several people had never seen a small scaled troop like the Amaranth troop utilize strategies actively.

They had a look of scattering, gathering, splitting up, and gathering again.

Amaranth troop resembled a huge stream of water.

It was a complete victory.

The battle ended with victory for the Amaranth troop.

Gulp.

Simon dry swallowed.

“Count Lancephil. the Amaranth troop is really amazing.”

His thoughts came out like that.

Io just smiled instead of replying back.

Then.

Dudududu.

One warhorse ran towards Simon with the sound of the horse clops.

He had a confident expression and spirit.

The troop flag that was on his side, instead of the spear, fluttered with strength.

Io, who was looking at that, said in a small voice.

“That’s the troop commander of Amaranth troop, Roan.”

“He looks truly majestic.”

Simon nodded with a satisfied expression.

Meanwhile, Roan finally reached the front of the group.

Hiiiiiing!

As he pulled the reins, the war horse softly stopped.

Roan dismounted from the horse and quickly stuck the flag into the ground.

Puk!

The flag of the troop was finely extended and emanated a confident spirit.

Roan rose from his kneeling position and saluted.

He had a mannered look and at the same time, roughless.

“Troop commander Roan of the Amaranth troop greets Prince Simon Rinse.”

He spoke in a voice with strength.

Roan bowed and caught his breath.

His expression was kind of stifled.

‘To be able to meet him this quickly.’

A strange light appeared in his eyes.

‘Simon Rinse. The first prince of the kingdom and…..’

His heart pounded.

‘The person that someday becomes the mad monarch.’

*****

After Roan returned to the past, one of the things he had to do was to stop the mad monarch.

‘Originally, the one that should have became the next king was him.’

But in the end, his seat was taken by his brother.

‘And he became crazy.’

After that, he killed his supporter and grandfather, Bradley Webster, and caused a commotion in the northwestern region of the kingdom.

As he lead a force and caused a commotion himself, he was called the mad monarch.

And as his original abilities were outstanding, the commotion couldn’t be easily suppressed.

With that reasoning, even after the geniuses Pierce and Ian appeared, Rinse Kingdom was unable to rise up in the empire ranking list of the continent due to the internal disturbances that it suffered.

‘If we only didn’t have the mad monarch, we could have combined the northeastern region of the continent.’

Because of that, Roan was planning to stop Simon from going crazy.

But he was a prince of the kingdom.

He wasn’t someone a mere troop commander, and a sinner on top of that, could easily meet.

But of course, he knew that he would get dispatched to the northern region because of the Poskein exodus.

But in his past life, he had gone to Pavor castle instead of this place.

‘Certainly, the future has changed a bit because of me.’

He hadn’t expected today’s encounter at all.

“The defenses are really outstanding.”

Simon, who was checking out the village’s fences, watchtower, and etc. nodded with an amazed expression.

“That’s an excessive complement.”

Roan hurriedly gathered his thoughts and bowed.

“No. It’s really outstanding.”

Simon looked at the fences and watchtower once again and had a satisfied expression.

The two people inspected the village that had the HQ of the troop located in it for quite a while.

‘It’s a mere countryside but the road, houses, and etc. are being built really well.’

The defenses weren’t the only things that were good.

The road crossing over the village was both smooth and hard, and the houses built with wood were clean and well built.

Most of all, the expressions of the people were really bright, even when it was a dangerous situation where monsters were going wild.

Simon nodded with a satisfied expression.

“You are maintaining the region of Tale really well. The expressions of the people are good.”

“I just did as much as i could as it is my job.”

Roan humbly replied and bowed.

Simon kept checking the houses and the camp after that.

“You said the village still doesn’t have a name?”

He lightly asked a question.

“Yes. As it was created just recently, everyone is calling it the central village.”

At Roan’s question, Simon pondered for a moment and then had a bright expression.

“How about Mediasis?”

It meant that it was the center and the base.

Roan didn’t have a choice anyways.

“It’s an excellent name.”

He faintly smiled and bowed.

Simon looked at that Roan and then asked.

“Roan. This subjugation is a really important thing for the nobles and for me. It’s something we must raise a big merit in.”

He had a really serious expression.

It was obvious. Because this could be a war that would decide the next king of the kingdom.

For Simon, it was something that he had to pour everything that he had into.

“The northern region of Tale is no different than the front line. If we completely block this part, the organization of the rear doesn’t become that difficult. Followed by that, our army is planning to subjugate the monsters with this point as the base. But we don’t know much about this region.”

Some kind of expectation was behind his voice.

“Compared to that, you’ve raised up really incredible achievements as the one responsible for this region. So I…….”

A moment’s silence.

Simon caught his breath and continued saying.

“Do you have any good thoughts or plans regarding the subjugation?”

It was a question he just threw out, but it was a really impressive thing.

The first prince of the kingdom asked the opinion of a mere troop commander.

Truly, this was an unprecedented thing.

If they were escorting knights or nobles, it was a thing that would cause a commotion.

But Simon was really calm.

‘If have the abilities, you don’t differentiate between slaves or sinners.’

This was Simon’s thoughts.

He needed an influential person to win in the competition for the throne.

Roan organized his thoughts for a moment and then raised his head to look at Simon.

“I don’t know if it’s good but I have something prepared.”

He spoke with a calm voice and expression.

Roan took out two scrolls of papers from his chest.

He spread out one of them and placed it on a wide table.

“This?”

At that moment, Simon had a surprised expression.

He eyes widely opened as if it was something he hadn’t expected at all.

On the other hand, Roan nodded with a calm expression.

“Yes. That’s right. It’s a map of the region of Tale.”

The identity of the map was a map made by the agency.

‘A map…..’

Silence fell between the two people.

The designing of a map was labeled as being a really dangerous thing.

Because you could suffer great damages if it was leaked to another kingdom.

Roan looked at the stiff expression of Simon and said in a low voice.

“The value of a map in battle is really big.”

He spread out the second scroll.

Likewise, it was a map of Tale, but the thing that was different with this map was that it had several dots and arrows on it.

“The dots are the places where the subjugations occurred and the arrows are the records of the movements of the monsters.”

His finger moved around busily.

“Based on the results of the analysis, the monsters are moving to the north through the mountain ranges spread from the west to east. Aside from that, they tend to move through the road between Mediasis Village and the plains of the west.”

Simon nodded unconsciously.

The scenery of a battlefield he imagined was done only through senses, and it was felt as if it was spread in front of his eyes.

The dots and arrows were of big help in grasping the entire flow of the battle.

Roan spread the first map again.

“We set up several traps, obstacles, and camps with the gathered and analyzed information as the background.”

“Ah…….!”

At that moment, a low exclamation came out of Simon’s mouth.

It was just like Roan said.

On the first map, there were records of camps, traps, and bases for the troop, and those places were on the moving routes of the monsters.

‘He wasn’t just fighting blindly!’

Simon unconsciously swallowed down dry saliva.

He was once again amazed at Roan’s abilities.

‘It’s a waste to just leave him as the commander of a single troop.’

He became certain of this.

Roan looked at the stifled expression of Simon and bowed.

“I know what the prince is worried of. And because of that, we are managing it so that this map isn’t taken outside.”

“Mm.”

Simon nodded with a low exclamation.

“If we have this map, it will certainly be of great help.”

It was a positive reaction.

Roan nodded.

“Yes. It will be of great help in the dispatching of troops and grasping movements.”

At those words, the eyes of Simon softly loosened up.

“Good. Making a map as you please is a punishable action, but as the situation is like this I will forgive you. No……..”

His mouth slightly rose.

“Actually, I think that it is really amazing. Because if we only have this map, we can perfectly control the region of Tale.”

Simon patted Roan’s shoulders with a proud expression.

‘Whew. Did it turn out well?’

Roan let out a short sigh.

Actually, showing him the map was one of the risks for him.

The making of a map was that much of a problem.

But he thought that when the Mad Monarch Simon saw this in this situation, it would be of help for him.

‘He was a really reasonable person and someone that valued personal strength before he became the mad monarch.’

Because of that, commoners with great ability could get an important job without the courting of the nobles.

“Roan. Shall we return now?”

He had finished observing.

“Yes. I will take the lead.”

Roan quickly took back the maps and after he put it near his chest, he started to walk.

Simon had a faint smile and followed his back.

The two people arrived in the conference room of the HQ where several nobles were gathered.

“Did you finish observing?”

Io smiled brightly and asked.

Simon glanced at Roan once more and then nodded.

“He was really amazing.”

At those words, several nobles nodded.

Just like Simon’s words, they were also greatly surprised at the power of the troop and the defenses of the central village, no, Mediasis Village.

Simon sat on a seat that Io had prepared.

And Roan humbly stood behind the nobles.

“Just like everyone of you knows, I decided to subjugate the monsters of the north with this point as the base.”

“Yes.”

At Simon’s words, several nobles nodded.

“Because of that, this region of Tale became more important than anywhere else. I can’t give the commanding right of this kind of place to anyone.”

He paused for a moment and then a faint smile appeared on his face.

Then, Simon’s sight moved to Roan.

“Roan. I’m planning to give the commanding right and strategy right to you.”

“Ah……..”

Roan and the several nobles let out low exclamations.

Because they knew the weight Simon’s words had.

‘Prince Simon entrusted Roan with the key of an army!’

Io bowed with a grateful expression.

But the protests of several nobles was too fierce.

“Prince. Roan is a sinner. To entrust the key of an army to someone like that. That can never happen.”

“Although it’s only limited to the region of Tale, but to give that to a mere commoner…… Some nobles may have to follow his orders.”

They had expressions where they were almost in tears.

Simon had a humorous look on his face.

‘If it wasn’t only for the competition of the throne, I would have already thrown them away.’

They were insect-like bastards that lived by sticking themselves onto the families without having any abilities.

But now was a situation that he had to lead even those nobles.

‘If you are saying that he’s a sinner……..’

Simon shook his hand and made the nobles shut up and then looked at Roan.

“In this moment I, Simon Rinse, act instead of his majesty Deni III to completely pardon Roan’s sins.”

“Prince!”

The nobles yelled with surprised expressions.

“Prince. You can’t decide to pardon the sin that easi…….”

“Stop.”

Simon shook his head and stopped them.

Strength was shown in his eyes.

“Speak. Is there someone that has raised some clear merits from the Pedian monster subjugation until the subjugation of Poskein lake?”

“But the sin of violence against a noble…..”

“Noble? Are you speaking about that rotten guy? After several investigations, his sins were clearly revealed. But you are defending that kind of guy?”

He had a presence like a column.

The nobles wavered and in the end, they shut their mouths.

In the first place, they were the ones that decided to follow Simon.

There was no need to be seen badly here.

“Everyone listen closely.”

Simon said with a strong voice.

“I like people with abilities. If he just has that, I wouldn’t care if that person was a sinner or a slave.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The nobles bowed and replied in one voice.

The importance of ability.

This was Simon’s philosophy.

‘Because of that, he couldn’t stand getting his throne taken away by someone that had less abilities than him.’

But of course, the decisive case that drove him crazy was another thing.

As he thought about that cruel case, his chest became heavy.

Roan let out a short sigh.

Then.

“Roan.”

Simon’s voice was heard.

“Come here.”

At those words, Roan carefully moved his feet and stood in front of Simon.

A heavy silence fell over the conference room.

Simon slowly stood up and loosened up the dagger he had on his waist.

It was a really luxurious dagger that didn’t look all that useful.

He gave the dagger to Roan.

“This dagger was something given by his majesty when I became an adult. It’s something made by famous blacksmiths and lapidaries of the capital of Miller. It’s my symbol I call Regate dagger and it’s an object proving the status of the 1st prince.”

Simon’s sight moved to the nobles.

“I’m going to give this dagger to Roan. You are to follow Roan’s orders as if they were mine, at least in the region of Tale, and follow him loyally.”

At that moment, a breath taking atmosphere was felt.

Several nobles were conflicted with stifled expressions but in the end, they bowed their heads.

“Yes. We will.”

Only after that did Simon nod with a satisfied expression on his face and gaze at Roan.

“Roan. I’m giving this Regate dagger to you.”

“Ah…..”

Roan let out a low cry and hurriedly kneeled down.

He slightly bowed as he delicately extended both of his hands.

Tuk.

The dagger was placed above his palms.

“Roan. This Regate dagger…..”

He spoke in a low voice as if he was whispering.

“You have to return it to me along with the victory.”

A humorous expression was seen on his face.

Roan replied while he was still in the posture to receive the dagger.

“Yes. I will certainly win.”

His voice slightly trembled.

Roan was moved.

‘I, a mere commoner troop commander, got the commanding rights and strategic rights, that are the core for an army.’

He was recognized by the first prince, Simon, and obtained some nobles under his command.

Compared to his past life, this life was a really the perfect foil in comparison.

Roan placed the dagger on his waist with careful movements.

The luxurious shape received light and shined.

The sights of the nobles poured onto Roan.

Envy, displeasement, jealousy.

Their eyes were mixed with several emotions.

‘Now whether they can act as limbs or not……’

He ground his teeth.

‘It’s all on me.’

His heart beat accelerated.

It wasn’t going to be easy, but he was confident.

He was planning to show his capabilities to these several nobles.

‘Not only because of the orders of the prince…….’

Flames appeared in his eyes.

‘I will make them want to follow me on their own.’

Soon, his quick beating heart returned to normal.

And even the excitement calmed down.

Roan looked at the faces of the nobles with a calm expression.

Several plans were set up in his head.

Now, Roan wasn’t just a normal troop commander anymore.

Chapter 95




Another to make your day better

The atmosphere of the conference room was complicated.

A calm and excited feeling pervaded the area.

It was the place to set up plans for the subjugation, but most of the nobles were thinking about other things.

‘I have to go to another region that’s not the region of Tale.’

‘If I remain here, I will be commanded by a commoner.’

Originally, they tried to be next to Simon.

They wanted to at least flatter him in someplace that he could see.

But now, the situation had changed.

Nobles above the rank of Count had a strong arrogance.

They thought that it to be difficult to receive Roan’s orders.

“I will be in charge of the west of Pavor castle.”

“I will take responsibility for the Peltin region.”

The nobles started to say that they would be in charge of the rear regions.

Because of that, five nobles with the rank of Viscount and Baron, who didn’t have any forces or strength, remained in the region of Tale.

But of course, there was one that proposed to remain in the region of Tale.

‘Viscount Delph Blick.’

He was a noble that was now 40 years old, was the size of a bear, and had a fierce temperament.

‘He was the one that followed the mad monarch until the end.’

Thanks to that, Roan could clearly remember him.

‘He excels in strength, but his problem is his hurried temperament and hot-bloodedness.

So to say it clearly, he was similar to Semi.

‘If I can control him well enough, he will become a commander that would be of great strength.’

While Roan was thinking and pondering of several things, the conference was soon reaching it’s end.

“Fine. Then, let’s end the conference now.”

Simon nodded with a satisfied expression.

There was no way that he didn’t know about the plots and displeasures of the nobles.

But he was still satisfied even while taking that into account.

‘It’s because of Roan.’

This was because there was already a solid defensive line set up in the entire region of Tale.

Simon said while looking at the nobles.

“Each of you will perform your roles as the day brightens.”

“Yes. Understood.”

All the nobles stood up and bowed.

Their expressions were pathetic.

They were also very familiar with the meaning that this subjugation had.

‘I certainly have to raise a large merit.’

This was the method where everyone could stay alive.

Roan felt the heat of the nobles and bitterly smiled.

‘I thought that I just had to stop the exodus well-enough to take the upper seat in the competition for the throne.’

But the future didn’t flow that easily.

Roan took a deep breath.

‘The really fierce and cruel competition still hasn’t start.’

He had to prepare for that moment.

He had met Simon faster than what he had thought.

Because of that, he had to hurry in his remaining preparations.

‘I am confident.’

He had already polished some of his base.

Now was the time to stand up on that base.

*****

The morning of the next day.

As soon as the day brightened up, most of the nobles led their troops and left Mediasis Village.

The ones that remained were the five viscounts and barons.

Along with Simon’s army and Io’s soldiers.

Roan sent the leaving nobles off as the one responsible for the region of Tale and the HQs.

“Whew.”

Roan let out a short sigh when the nobles left with their troops.

“It’s not easy, right?”

Then, a familiar voice was heard from the back.

It was Io.

He approached with a proud expression and grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

“They are all nobles filled with useless pride.”

Io bitterly smiled and shook his head.

He looked at the nobles that were moving farther away and continued saying.

“Congratulations in getting the commanding and strategic rights for Tale. Now, you will be able to properly do your thing.”

Although many nobles had left, just by combining the number of Simon’s army and the soldiers of the other nobles, that number amounted to more than 20,000.

For Roan who had faced the monsters with only the 1,000 soldiers of Amaranth troop, it was a force just like a thousand war horses.

The opportunity to execute the several strategies and tactics he couldn’t utilize because he lacked the numbers were now possible.

But of course, it wouldn’t be easy.

Io looked at Roan and asked in a low voice.

“Although the nobles that remained are only viscounts and barons, a noble is still a noble. They won’t be easy to handle. Are you confident?”

At those words, Roan had a faint smile on his face.

It was a look that was full of confidence and leisure.

“Now that I became the one responsible…….”

A red light shined in his eyes.

“There’s no differentiation between nobles and commoners. They are all soldiers.”

He spoke in a voice filled with strength.

Io slowly nodded.

‘I can already see the look of a commander.’

A proud expression could be seen on his face.

Roan and Io both faintly smiled and faced each other.

Their sights became interlocked with a strong heat that flowed between them.

*****

After Roan returned to the HQ’s, he ordered Austin to gather all of the nobles that remained in the Tale region.

The gathering place was a secluded building outside the HQ.

It was because Simon was using it as an office and a conference room.

“Tch. Already pretending to be a commander.”

Among the nobles that remained in Tale and had the strongest force, Baron George Ant complained with an expression of displeasure.

This was because he had received Roan’s order to gather while he was setting up a camp and placing down his stuff.

“Hmph. Even if he’s outstanding, how outstanding could he be…….”

George had also read several of the reports and knew how outstanding Roan’s merits were.

But it hurt his pride to recognize him.

‘Tch. I dare you to make a mistake. I will kick you out from the seat as the one responsible for this region.’

He spat on the floor and kept moving.

He saw the gathering building from far away.

“You came.”

The guards that were in front of the building saluted once and then opened up the closed doors.

The soldiers that belonged to the Amaranth troop had manners and dignity in their actions.

‘Hhm.’

George smacked his lips for no reason and entered the building.

As he looked at the respectful posture of the guards, he felt his mood loosen up.

He moved up a few more steps and opened up the door of the conference room.

At that moment.

‘Damn it.’

His relaxed expression became rigid again.

No, instead, it became flustered.

His line of sight moved towards the upper seat of the conference room.

‘So you’re the commander, huh?’

Roan was seated at the head of the long table.

Next to him, the nobles and knights of Simon’s army and the nobles that remained with George were seated.

They also had scowling expressions like George.

He knew that he had to take orders from Roan because of Simon’s orders and he agreed to it because he had no other options. But as he was facing the situation itself, it didn’t feel that good.

‘Damn.’

George cursed inwardly and then moved.

He sat down in an empty seat with a heavy thud.

He had a feeling that his situation with Roan was being changing on a moment’s notice.

‘Damn.’

Curses came out once again.

Then.

“We are all gathered here.”

He spoke in a low but composed voice.

Roan stood up and had a faint smile on his face.

He looked at the faces of the nobles and then bowed.

“I am Roan that was put in charge of the region of Tale with the orders of the 1st Prince.”

There was no applause.

There weren’t even any friendly gazes.

But Roan didn’t mind.

“I know that you are all displeased with this situation. But it’s time to concentrate on making the subjugation become a victory rather than focusing ranks.”

It was a completely true statement.

But the expressions of the nobles still hadn’t changed.

‘It’s just like I had expected.’

Roan bitterly smiled and sat down.

He took out a thick roll of paper and grabbed a pen.

“Shall we grasp the number of the soldiers first? Exactly how many soldiers are in the army of the 1st Prince?”

Right before he finished his sentence, the leader of the knights that was sitting at his side spoke with a blunt voice.

“15,000. 2,000 are knights and 500 mages.”

It was more solid and amazing of a force than what he was expecting.

Roan kept asking about the forces of the nobles seated at his side.

“3,000.”

“2,000.”

“3,000.”

They spoke in short replies.

The number of the forces was generally similar.

In the case of the nobles that had a territory, they didn’t bring as many soldiers as they still needed some to protect their territory.

‘Adding up the soldiers of Count Lancephil, I have about 28,000?’

It was an army nearly 30,000.

Roan’s mouth slightly rose up.

‘This much is enough.’

Several strategies and tactics he couldn’t use until now sprang forth from his head.

He took out a scroll from his chest.

It was the map of the region of Tale.

Chwaruuk.

The map was spread out on the table.

“Mm.”

The nobles let out low cries.

They had heard from the conference that Roan had made a map.

But as they actually saw it with their own eyes, it was kind of perplexing.

‘He really made one.’

‘For a map to be this detailed.’

Everyone had surprised expressions.

But Roan didn’t care.

He spread out the map and raised up a pointing stick.

Tak!

The tip of the stick pointed at the troop’s HQ.

“This is Mediasis Village.”

The nobles unconsciously nodded.

Roan smiled faintly and moved his stick.

“This is Poskein Lake.”

An outline appeared even when he only pointed at places.

Roan continued to speak.

“We are going to set up a defensive line in the south with Mediasis Village as the base.”

The stick kept moving sideways on the map.

“I’m planning to set up a perfect defensive line that goes from the east to the west to block the path of the monsters.”

Roan pointed at the several dots drawn in the map.

“These are camps that are already set up. If you use this camps actively, it will be of big help in setting up your own camps.”

“Mm.”

The nobles unconsciously nodded.

This was because the camps, traps, and obstacles that Roan had prepared were more solid than what they had expected.

Roan smiled faintly and continued to speak.

“Then, I will speak about the dispatchment of the troops.”

The stick moved quickly.

“First, as the army of the 1st prince is the strongest……..”

Roan calmly laid down the plans that he had thought up.

It was a solid plan.

‘He’s just as amazing as the prince had said.’

Viscount Tío Ruin, who was ranked amongst the heads of the nobles, was greatly amazed.

But the expressions of the other nobles weren’t as excited.

“Lastly, I hope Sir Baron George Ant sets up a formation at the back of the eastern region of Tale.”

This was his last order.

“Hmph!”

George snorted with an expression of displeasure.

He could endure everything else because it was Simon’s orders.

But he couldn’t do so for this one.

“How come I get to set up a formation at the rear?”

He spoke with an upset voice.

He stood up from his seat and pointed at a certain part of the map with his finger.

“I will also be placed near Mediasis Village.”

Now that he had the chance to remain in the Tale Region, he wanted to stay near Simon.

He had to raise up merits where he could be seen.

Roan shook his head with a composed expression.

“That’s impossible.”

At that moment, George’s face became red.

‘This bastard!’

To ignore the words of a noble.

His anger was building up.

“Amongst the nobles that have remained in the region of Tale, I have the greatest number of soldiers. So isn’t it obvious for me to defend the center, that is Mediasis Village?”

This was the truth.

George had done the unreasonable by bringing soldiers from his territory to raise enough merits at this opportunity.

Thanks to that, he had greater numbers than the other nobles.

But Roan shook his head once again.

“Baron Ant has to guard the eastern region.”

He spoke with a composed voice.

“This is the moving route of the monsters.”

That’s why he had dispatched George, who had the greatest numbers, over there.

Bang!

George smacked the table with a red face.

“It seems like you became unable to see things properly because you became the commander through the prince’s orders! I am a noble of the kingdom……”

When he talked up to that point.

Srung!

Roan pulled the dagger out from his waist.

It was the Regate dagger.

The fierce and sharp dagger showed itself.

“Huh?”

“Um?”

The nobles were surprised and stood up from their seats.

Roan didn’t mind and stabbed the dagger down onto the table.

“Pant!”

George looked at the dagger stabbing towards the back of his hand and gulped down some air.

Puk!

It was like a heavy sound that resounded in your ears.

The dagger was precisely stuck at the tip of George’s fingers.

“Uhhhhhhh.”

George trembled and looked at Roan.

“You bastard, what are you doing right now?!”

Even his voice was trembling.

Roan properly looked at George and spoke with a fierce voice.

“This dagger is the Regate dagger that the 1st prince granted to me.”

The dagger moved to the sides while being stuck into the table.

“The prince had certainly said to follow my orders like it was his own.”

His fierce voice became stuck in the ear of the nobles.

“Mmm.”

George had a displeased and stiff expression on his face.

But now that Roan had taken out the Regate dagger, he had no way to rebuke him anymore.

Roan was staring down at George.

“Will you disobey my orders?”

“Grr.”

George stepped back.

He wanted to grab his throat and raise him up, but he couldn’t do so because of the Regate dagger.

“Damn it.”

George cursed aloud and sat down with a thud.

And the expressions of the other nobles weren’t good.

There were also some nobles that had complaints in their dispatch locations but Roan’s actions just now was ignoring the title of nobility.

Roan read the looks on their faces but he didn’t care.

“Then. I believe you will all follow my orders.”

There were no reactions.

“With this, I will end the meet……..”

When he talked up to that point, some nobles stood up and left the room.

“The world is spinning backwards!”

“Damn it!”

“Does this make sense?!”

Some nobles complained loudly on purpose.

At the sudden situation, Roan smiled bitterly and finished speaking.

“I will end the meeting here.”

The conference ended like that.

Even the other nobles that had remained, they slowly stood up and left the room.

Roan stayed in the room and sent them off.

The conference room became empty in an instant.

Then.

“Did the meeting end up going well?”

Austin appeared with a familiar voice.

He had a somewhat worried face.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“Better than I thought.”

A short and thick reply came out.

Austin bitterly smiled and shook his head.

“Will those high-nosed nobles follow your orders?”

He had a really skeptical reaction.

Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“They have to. My orders are the prince’s orders. But……”

He stared right at Austin.

“It wouldn’t be bad having one or two nobles not following my orders.”

At those words, Austin tilted his head.

“Why……..?”

Roan just smiled instead of replying back.

His mouth rose up and his eyes dropped.

He had a soft look on his face.

But there was a red flame in his eyes.

That was the revelation of a strong determination.

Chapter 96




Mediasis village became noisy once again.

Because the nobles that received Roan’s orders started to move out while they led their troops.

Roan ordered one centurion to go with each of the troops and led them to the exact location.

‘A force of 30,000….. I really became a general.’

Roan looked at the troops scattering out while he was on top of a watchtower and put on a smile.

With this amount of soldiers, he would be able to stop the Poskein Exodus with troops to spare.

‘It will be different than my past life.’

They suffered great losses because they couldn’t properly stop the monsters.

But this time, at least on the northern region, they could at least prepare to some degree because of Roan’s performances.

Then.

“A beacon.”

A beacon surged up from the south.

After the Poskein Exodus started, the beacons surged up a few times a day.

The drums and jings started to ring even before Roan gave the order.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!

The Amaranth troop took formations and prepared themselves as if they had been waiting for it.

It gave off a really nimble and quick look.

Roan also hurried down from the watchtower and prepared to charge out.

“A beacon surged up from the south!”

A loud yell rang out.

Roan looked at the faces of the troop members.

“Amaranth troop! Charge!”

The order was given out.

The Amaranth troop charged out of the HQ with Roan at the front.

They truly looked majestic.

“This troop is certainly well-trained.”

Simon, who was looking at the troop march out, became amazed and spoke in a low voice.

Io, who was at his side, had a bright smile at the proud this made him feel.

“Yes. It’s a strong army that’s quite rare to see nowadays.”

At Io’s words, Simon nodded.

‘Roan. The Amaranth troop. Perhaps they may be of great strength to me in the future.’

His chest became hot.

The subjugation was to be one step ahead in the competition for the throne.

He thought that perhaps he would be receiving a grand treasure when he hadn’t thought he would.

‘If Roan decides to follow me…….’

He couldn’t just leave him as a troop commander in this kind of region.

‘He will have use his power for me.’

A strange expression appeared on his face.

Simon wasn’t looking at today or tomorrow, but at the distant future.

*****

The subjugation of the Tale Region was easier than they had initially thought.

This was because the Amaranth troop and Simon’s troop left to actively subjugate the monsters after setting up a defensive line that went from the east to the west.

It certainly was a really positive situation, but Roan didn’t get careless.

“Even if it’s easy, it’s just too easy.”

He looked at the map spread out on the table and frowned.

Austin and the other centurions were next to him.

“What do you mean?”

These words were asked carefully.

Roan pointed the southern part of Tale with his stick.

“It feels like the number of monsters has decreased.”

It wasn’t just his feeling.

Actually, after Simon and the nobles had come to Tale, the number of beacons surging up had decreased.

At those words Austin smiled brightly and said.

“Isn’t it time for the exodus to slowly end?”

Several centurions nodded as if they had agreed to the statement.

But Roan’s expression was still stiff and didn’t seem like it would loosen up.

‘No, that’s not it. The Poskein Exodus occurs for twenty more days.’

He clearly remembered how long the exodus had lasted.

And this was because it was a big case that made memorize it.

‘In the last three days, about five times the normal amount of monsters poured out.’

This was what you would call the final exodus.

In his past life, the Rinse Kingdom judged that the exodus was coming to an end because the number of monsters was slowly decreasing.

And in the end, because of this carelessness, they suffered great damages during the last three days of the exodus.

‘It’s not time for the exodus to end yet.’

There may be another reason in why the monsters had decreased.

‘I told the information squad and the agency to search for the cause of this so there will soon be an answer.’

He couldn’t continue with the strategies while he felt like this.

Then.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

A knocking sound was heard in the conference room.

“Come in.”

Right before he said that, a familiar face appeared from the open door.

It was Keep and the staff of the agency.

“I finished the thing that you ordered us to do.”

He spoke in an urgent voice and the same emotion could be seen on his face.

Keep approached and stood next to Roan.

He looked at the map spread out on the table and had an expression as if saying that it was nice that it was spread out.

“Just as you had told us, the movements of the monsters aren’t normal.”

The tip of his finger moved to a mountainous area ranging from the east to west of Tale.

“The monsters that were moving to the north until now are now moving towards the mountain range.”

“Are they planning to cross the mountains?”

“Yes. We think so.”

Keep nodded with a serious expression.

The same went for Roan.

‘To think of crossing the mountains.’

The region of Tale was a perfect valley.

The mountains blocking the west and the east weren’t that high, but they were harsh.

Because of that, there wasn’t a route in the mountains.

To go to the other regions, you could only use the plains in the north or the lake that was at the south.

“What’s the mountain they plan to cross over?”

At the question that was asked shortly after the report, Keep pointed at two mountains.

It was a place far from the current defensive lines.

‘I can’t let them cross over.’

They had to exterminate the monsters from the region of Tale inside of the region of Tale.

That was Roan’s plans.

‘I will have to lower the defensive line to the south.’

He was planning to completely suppress the monsters so that they couldn’t even ride up the mountain.

“I will have to change my plans.”

Roan looked at the centurions and opened his mouth.

“Lower the actual defensive line to the south and then exterminate the monsters that get close.”

Roan’s orders continued to come out.

“Notify the nobles about the situation and make them move the camps to the south.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The centurions all nodded and replied in one voice.

Roan grabbed the table with his hands and peeked his head towards them.

The eyes of Roan and the centurions were fiercely interlocked.

“A large battle may occur in these few coming days. Everybody, be prepared for it.”

“Yes. We will take that into account.”

The centurions ground their teeth and nodded.

Heat could be felt in the conference room.

*****

Bang!

George Ant threw the apple that he was holding.

“This fuc……..”

Curses came up to the tip of his tongue.

He glared at the soldier that made the report while he was inside a wooden tub filled with water.

“Say that once again.”

“Th, tha……”

The soldier stuttered with a really nervous expression on his face.

“The soldiers of the Amaranth troop came from Mediasis Village. Troop Commander Roan said to move the defensive line to the south…….”

When he talked up to that point.

Bang!

An apple flew once again.

George rose up from the tub.

His swollen stomach and stretched leg fat was seen.

The maidens that were serving him next to the tub approached and after they wiped off the water, they dressed him in a gown.

George grabbed another apple.

“Roan. This bastard sure is having his fun. Real fun.”

There was a real displeased expression on his face.

George cursed for a while with an annoyed expression.

“How long has it been since we set up the camp and now he tells us to lower it down again?”

The straight house had also been recently built.

He was planning to melt his body in warm water and have a hot night with the young maidens that he had brought with him.

‘Son of a bitch. If I tell him I won’t follow his orders, he will pull out the dagger again.’

A fishy smile appeared on his face.

George shook his hand towards the soldier.

“Tell the members of the Amaranth troop that brought the notices that I listened to it well.”

“Yes? Ah, yes. I understand.”

The soldier nodded with a surprised expression and then left the house.

George saw that and snorted.

“Hmph.”

As the order was given, he was indeed planning to move the camp.

But even so, he wasn’t planning to do it immediately.

‘The soldiers are also really exhausted after setting up the camp. It’s impossible to make them move the camp right now.’

It was obviously a good excuse.

‘What will happen if only I get out of the defense line?’

A terrible mistake.

George took a bite of the apple and had a strange smile.

“Huhuhu. For a commoner to make a noble move here and there. Take a hit at this.”

His eyes became chilly.

It was a really stupid decision and thought.

Thanks to that, the situation began to flow in an unexpected direction.

*****

“They’re all a mess, was it?”

Roan checked out the several documents and bitterly smiled.

Austin let out a short sigh.

“Yes. Excluding Viscount Delph Blick and the nobles under his command, they are all the worst.”

At those words, Roan moved the documents to the side and looked at Austin.

“They bring women and clowns to a battlefield and they open up a party everyday?”

“Yes. It’s all true.”

Austin smiled awkwardly and nodded.

Roan clicked his tongue with a taut expression on his face.

“They’re all out of their minds.”

He wanted to clearly curse out once.

“What about the reactions of my orders?”

“They were all displeased, but they said they would follow it.”

“I’m glad at least.”

Roan stood up and shook his head.

“The monsters will come out more fiercely when they realize that the roads to the mountains are blocked. Make sure everyone gets a hold of themselves.”

“Yes. I will certainly tell them that.”

Austin bowed and then left the conference room.

Roan smacked his lips once again and let out a sigh when he was left alone.

He felt his mouth turn bitter because of the nobles.

‘If I someday become a monarch, I will use people based on their abilities rather than ranks.’

He was a commoner from birth.

And from a really poor mountainside village at that.

Because of that, Roan had realized the big disadvantage the titles of nobility had.

‘I will give everyone a fair opportunity, regardless of ranks and titles.’

It would be a world where everyone could realize their dreams.

That was the world Roan thought of.

*****

“kirr.”

A nork fell while making that sound.

Roan looked at his surroundings while he put away his spear.

It was a complete victory.

The monsters were exterminated without even leaving one behind.

“Retrieve the corpses of the fallen soldiers and treat the injured ones!”

A loud yell rang out.

The troop members of the Amaranth Troop began to organize the battlefield.

Roan looked at the southern sky and let out a long sigh.

‘Because I lowered the defensive line to the south, the monsters lost their direction and are wandering about.’

Because the road to enter the mountains was completely blocked off.

‘If it’s like this, we will be able to perfectly cut them of……..’

When he thought up to that moment.

Roan frowned.

‘A beacon?’

A beacon surged up from the rear of the north.

But it wasn’t a normal one.

‘Two, three?’

There wasn’t black smoke, and three surged up consecutively.

It meant that it was that urgent of a situation.

He chased with Kalian’s Tear and saw that the entire western region was a world of beacons.

“Troop commander! A beacon has surged up! And three at the same time at that!”

Austin discovered the beacon late and came running over.

Roan aimed at the direction of the beacon and ground his teeth.

‘It’s the west. It’s a beacon surging from the end of the west. Then……..’

At that moment, the face of a person appeared in his head.

‘Baron George Ant!’

George was the one in charge of the defensive line to the west.

Roan hurriedly mounted his horse.

“It seems like something happened to the defensive line in the west. Amaranth troop get ready to move!”

“Yes! Understood!”

Austin replied and then sent a sign to the troop members.

Flutter! Flutter!

As the flagman shook a small flag, the troop members that were organizing the battlefield took formations and lined up.

Roan looked at the beacon burning up black and tightly gripped the reins.

‘George Ant. Just what the hell did you do?’

Flames appeared in his eyes.

Chapter 97





“That crazy bastard!”

Dass, a soldier of the information squad, cursed when he looked at the troop settling down in the mountain ranges.

“A beacon has surged up!”

It was a sound that hit your ears.

As he turned his head, he saw a beacon surging up from the west.

“Tch!”

Dass spat out on the ground and then walked towards the camp.

‘Damn. I have no face to see troop commander Roan. No face at all.’

He was a soldier of the information squad in charge of surveilling the front lines of the east.

He had the role of quickly informing Roan in case the nobles didn’t follow his orders.

And especially Baron George Ant who had a lot of complaints against Roan.

Because of that, he was putting in more effort and checked on him thoroughly.

‘I was a bit relieved when they moved the camp to the south as troop commander’s orders but……’

He was a bit slower than the other nobles, but George had also moved the camp to the south.

It was a settling look in the defensive lines.

But after two days of having settled down, they started to show weird movements.

‘They started to suddenly withdraw the camp.’

For now, he sent the soldiers of the information squad to Mediasis village.

But as George’s troop kept moving towards the north, he couldn’t stand watching anymore.

In the end, he sent an information squad to a close beacon.

Meanwhile, George who kept moving towards the north, started to settle down in a mountain range.

‘Crazy bastard.’

It was a shape that he couldn’t understand at all.

Dass moved his feet towards George’s camp.

“Stop!”

The guards, that were at the entrance, raised their spears.

Dass took out a piece of cloth that had the symbol of Amaranth troop drawn in it.

“I’m a member of the Amaranth troop.”

They were already familiar with each other.

The guarded entrance opened up.

Dass hurriedly crossed the camp that was starting to take shape.

‘He’s there.’

As he approached the center of the camp, he saw George standing below a big shadow.

“Sir Baron Ant.”

“Huh?”

George, who was lightly casually up a grape, frowned at Dass’s entrance.

‘He was from Amaranth, right?’

It was obvious that he came because he pulled back the camp.

George shrugged his shoulders while feigning ignorance.

“What’s the matter”

“What’s the reason you broke the formation and fell back?”

Dass asked as politely and humbly as possible.

“Aha. You are talking about that.”

George brightly smiled and scratched his belly.

“I was looking at the position of the camp. I think that rather than the plains of the south, this mountain range would be much better. The back is blocked by the rough mountains and at the front it’s mere plains, so there was nowhere better than this place.”

He grabbed one more grape and put on a fishy smile.

“Even so, it seems like troop commander Roan made a mistake because he lacked in experience. For a general at my level, this is the most suitable place to set up the camp.”

Dass took in a breath and then carefully spoke.

“But if Baron Ant falls back alone, then all the other defenses will be put in danger.”

At that moment, George burst out of laughter.

“Hahaha. You worry too much. If that does happen, I will lead my troop myself and rescue them. Even if I look like this, i’m a renowned general. Hahaha.”

George was speaking nonsense as if it was nothing.

Dass was about to say something else but he didn’t.

Because he realized that he wasn’t someone he could hold a conversation with.

“I understand. Then, I will go back now.”

Dass bowed and then turned around to keep walking.

‘Damn. Stupid bastard.’

Curses roamed around in his mouth.

‘Because of you, the entire defensive line has become fragile! For even a villagers like me had realized it and a bastard that calls himself a noble doesn’t!’

He had an urgent expression on his face.

‘If monsters appear……..’

His face became red.

His annoyance and rage surged up.

Dass left the camp and went towards the close by mountain with the information squad.

It was to monitor the plains in the south.

“Ah……”

At that moment, a low exclamation came out of Dass’s voice and the other members.

Their faces became pale.

“Monsters!”

A white dust cloud surged up from beyond the plains.

It would have been good if it was the Amaranth troop or another allied troop, but unfortunately, what appeared was an amazing number of monsters.

The monsters were charging through the south because the defensive line was opened up because of George’s troop falling back.

‘If I leave it like this, the northeastern region of Tale becomes a wasteland!’

Urgency appeared in Dass’s expression.

He made someone blow the horn trumpet through a handsign.

Puuuuuu!

A sound that made your heart beat beat faster while flowing through the wind.

But George’s camp didn’t show any movements.

‘Why! Just what are you doing?! Stupid bastard!’

Dass ground his teeth.

Rage.

A chilly murdering intent appeared in his eyes.

“Go to the beacons! Tell them to light the beacons!”

An urgent voice flowed through the wind.

*****

“Kuak!”

“Kek!”

The cries filled up the entire battlefield.

Red flames surged up and black smoke covered your field of vision.

It was a cruel sight.

There were countless corpses that didn’t have their heads on the battlefield.

“Whew.”

Roan stood in the middle of the battlefield and let out a long sigh.

He had a stiff expression on his face.

He held the Travias Spear upside down and looked towards the north.

“Son of a bitch.”

Curses came out on it’s own.

Then.

“For now, we have cut down the tails of the monsters!”

Austin’s voice was heard.

He was completely covered in blood.

Although they had obtained victory after the fierce battle, his expression wasn’t good.

“The troop of Baron Rael Piad was annihilated.”

Rael was right next to the west of George’s camp.

As George pulled back the camp on his own, the camp that was next to it suffered the attack of the monsters.

Because of that, they suffered damages close to annihilation and the strong defensive line crumbled down like a sand castle.

“And Baron Piad?”

“Fortunately safe. He has fled towards the camp of Viscount Blick.”

At those words, Roan slowly nodded.

Then, a group of people appeared at their north.

It was Dass and the information squad.

“Troop commander!”

They kneeled down as soon as they approached Roan.

“We are sorry!”

An earnest voice apologized.

Their shoulders trembled.

But Roan’s expression was composed.

“It’s not your fault.”

It gave a short response.

At those words, Dass and the others that were about to shed tears, forcefully help them back.

Roan looked at them and ground his teeth.

‘In a battlefield, the role of magicians diminishes……’

After facing today’s scandal, he felt regret at the absence of magicians.

‘Even if we could use communication magic, we would have been able to move quicker.’

The magicians in Tale were the ones in Simon’s troop, and those amounted to a mere 500.

‘They are all attack purposed magicians, so they don’t even know communication magic…….’

In the current situation, they weren’t of much help at all.

“Everyone, stand up.”

He spoke in a soft voice.

Dass and the others hesitated and then carefully stood up.

Tear marks were seen on their faces.

“George Ant. That bastard?”

He didn’t even add the title.

Dass pointed to the north.

“He’s not even moving from the mountains.”

Roan slowly nodded and then moved.

His feet led his forces and went towards Viscount Tio Luin.

“Viscount Luin.”

“What happened?”

There was complete annoyance in the face of Tio, who was cleaning up the battlefield.

Because he realized that this battle occurred because of George.

“Lead your troop and chase the monsters that went to the north please.”

“And you?”

“I…….”

Roan glared at the north and said.

“I will have to go and find Baron Ant.”

“Mmm.”

Tio let out a low cry of exclamation and nodded.

He didn’t have any words to say anymore.

The two people looked at each other for a moment and separated.

Roan got on his horse and raised his spear high.

“Amaranth troop, we are going to the mountains where George’s troop is at!”

“Yes! Understood!”

A loud voice rang out .

It was a voice that kind of had a chilly murderous intent inside of it.

Roan called to Austin with a handsign.

“Austin. When we arrive the camp……”

He gave him orders in a low voice.

Austin nodded with a severe expression.

“Don’t worry.”

A short salute followed afterwards.

Roan looked at that and nodded, and then pulled the reins.

Hiiiiiing!

The head of the horse headed towards the north with a cry.

“Move!”

The order fell.

Roan and the Amaranth troop moved over the corpses of their allies and moved towards the north.

Tio, who was looking at that scene, mumbled in a low voice.

“George Ant. My stupid friend. It seems like your power only amounts to this much.”

His voice was as lonely as the battlefield.

*****

<Amaranth.>

The flag covered in blood fluttered at the front.

Roan and the troop appeared at George’s camp located in the mountains.

The flagman ran a step ahead and then shook the flag.

“It’s the Amaranth troop!”

The soldiers, who were on the watchtower, quickly shook their hands.

Kiiiiig!

The closed gates opened up.

Roan looked at Austin once and then kicked the horse.

The Amaranth troop entered the camp with the cavalrymen at the forefront.

“It seems like they had a tough fight.’

“But seems like they won anyways.”

“Can we stay like this?”

The soldiers of George’s troop gathered up.

They conversed in nervous expressions.

But Roan didn’t even glance at them.

His objective was fixed.

‘Austin.’

‘Yes, commander.’

The two of them exchanged glances.

Austin shook his hands quickly to the sides and sent a sign.

At that moment, the troop members pulled their weapons from their waists.

At the same time.

Flutter! Flutter!

The flagman that was at the front shook his flag.

And the troop members charged to the front as if they had been waiting for it.

“Huh? Huh?”

“Wh, what is it?”

The adjutants of George’s troop, that were looking at Amaranth troop, put surprised expressions.

They saw the members of Amaranth troop running towards them and opened up their eyes where they were as large as saucers.

“Capture them!”

Austin’s voice rang through the battlefield.

It was a short order, but the troop members moved nimbly.

The Amaranth troop was the strongest among the strongest.

They weren’t someone a troop like George’s, who enjoyed partying in the middle of the battlefield, could face.

Cheng! Checheng!

The spears and swords were pointed at the necks of the adjutants.

“Hik!”

“Gulp.”

George’s troop commanders couldn’t even properly resist and raised their arms.

Surrender.

The capturing was so easy that it was disappointing.

“Thi, what is this?”

“Why are you like this?”

The normal soldiers of George’s troop gathered up with half absent-minded expressions.

Roan dismounted the horse and pulled out the Regate dagger.

“I, Troop Commander Roan of the Amaranth troop, received the commanding and strategizing rights by the 1st prince. But Baron George Ant moved the camp as he pleased while ignoring my orders and broke the defensive lines. This is a severe violation of military discipline. From now on, I will name Baron George Ant as a sinner.”

He had fierce eyes and a cold voice.

Gulp.

The normal soldiers swallowed dry saliva with nervous expressions.

Roan kept talking.

“If there’s someone trying to obstruct my actions, I will also treat them as sinners.”

As soon as he finished talking, the members of the Amaranth troop raised their weapons.

Pat!

The tips of the sharp weapons were pointed at the soldiers.

“Uuuu.”

“We, we just did as we were ordered to.”

George’s soldiers already lost all will to fight back.

This was because the commanders above the rank of adjutant had already been captured.

Roan calmly caught his breath and then put back his dagger.

His sight naturally moved over to the center of the camp.

The remaining one was only George Ant.

“Austin.”

A low calling voice spoke out and he gave out a signal.

“Yes. I understand.”

Soon, 50 members of the Amaranth troop moved towards the center with Roan at the front.

“Wh, what are you!”

“Stop!”

The soldiers, who were guarding the center, discovered the Amaranth troop and yelled.

‘Damn. I thought the camp was noisy. So it was because of them!’

Srung.

They pulled out their weapons late.

But Roan’s and the troop member’s movements were faster.

Cheng! Checheng!

The spears and swords hit their weapons.

“Kuk.”

The knights and commanders of George’s troop ground their teeth at the numbness they felt.

Roan moved in between them.

Pubuk! Pububuk!

He executed Reid’s battle technique.

“Kuk!”

The knights and commanders kneeled down with a painful sound.

“Tie them up!”

The members of the Amaranth troop quickly came running over and firmly captured them.

It was a perfect suppression.

But they didn’t have leisure to lower their steps.

Roan walked towards a huge and luxurious tent located in the center of the camp.

‘George Ant.’

He unconsciously ground his teeth.

Then, the stiffly closed gates opened up and five knights with big bodies appeared.

They moved out to check what was happening outside because it was too noisy.

“Huh?”

“Yo, you?”

The knights discovered Roan in front of them and had surprised expressions on their faces.

Roan didn’t even talk and extended his hand to grab their throats.

His movements were filled with Reid’s battle techniques.

Pubuk!

At one hand movement, their posture broke, and his fists hit them from the broken stances.

“Kuk!”

Five knights collapsed in just an instant.

“Uhhhhhh.”

“Yo, you crazy bastard…….”

Their grunts were filled with pain.

Roan glared at them with a composed expression and then opened up the doors.

At that moment, a luxurious place was seen inside the doors.

“Huh? Yo, you?”

In a fashionable chair located at the center.

George was sitting on that chair eating sweet fruits.

He was surprised at Roan’s sudden appearance.

‘The reason why it was so noisy was because of you?’

The knights he sent to check what was happening weren’t here anymore.

‘Maybe?’

Even if he had the commanding and strategic rights, a mere commoner troop commander laid his hands on knights belonging to a noble family?

George couldn’t believe it.

“Was it you making the fuss outside of the tent?”

‘Even if you placed a hand on the knights, you won’t be able to do anything to me. Kukuku.’

He laughed in a strange way and grabbed another grape.

He wanted to show Roan a look of leisure.

“It seems like you won’t answer. A noble is asking you but you dare…..”

He couldn’t continue speaking.

Because Roan suddenly charged forward.

“Son of a bitch!”

A sound exploded out where he was yelling with all of his strength.

At the same time, his right fist split the air and hit George’s chest.

Puk!

“Kok!”

George rolled on the ground with the chair.

“Cough! Cough!”

The coughs were clearly heard.

Roan moved his feet like that and stepped on his chest.

Kwak.

“Kugh.”

George struggled with a pained expression on his face.

But Roan’s foot didn’t move at all.

“You, you bastard. What are you doing right now?!”

George yelled.

“It seems like you forgot who I am! I am Rinse kingdom’s……..”

When he talked up to that point.

Roan’s mouth twisted.

“I know too well. You are the trash of Rinse Kingdom.”

He put more strength in the leg, pressing even harder on his chest.

George struggled even more at the feeling that his breath was getting cut off.

“You crazy bastard! Do you know what kind of thing you are doing right now! You are committing violence against a noble!”

“Noble?”

Roan suspiciously smiled and pulled out the Regate Dagger that he had on his waist.

“This is Regate Dagger that the 1st prince gave me while granting me the commanding and strategic rights. My orders are the orders of the prince. George Ant. You haven’t obeyed the orders of the 1st prince.”

“Th, that…..”

George was at a loss for words.

It was true that Roan had received the Regate Dagger.

‘Even so, for a commoner to place his hands on a noble!’

It was something that couldn’t be pardoned or comprehended at all for a noble.

Roan pressed down on the chest even harder.

“Why didn’t you follow my orders and move the camp as had you pleased?”

“That’s because this place is more advantageous in setting up a camp!”

A confident yell came out of George’s mouth.

Roan shook his head with a stiff expression on his face.

“Stupid bastard.”

“Wh, what?! This bastard…….. Kuk!”

George shut his mouth in the middle of cursing at the feeling where his rib cage was breaking.

Roan glared at him with cold eyes.

“Why didn’t you charge out when monsters appeared in the plains after you had set up the camp?”

“Th, that……”

He couldn’t say that he had gotten scared after looking at the scale of the monsters that was greater than what he had thought.

Naturally, he paused his words.

Fire appeared in Roan’s eyes.

“Trash like bastard.”

Right before he finished saying that, his arm moved.

It was a fist with Reid’s battle technique behind it.

Pagak!

Roan hit George’s face with all that he had.

“Kuk!”

His nose became bent and all of his teeth broke.

“Grr.”

George spat bloody foam because of the severe pain.

“Because of you, allies that shouldn’t died, have died. And the ones that shouldn’t have gotten hurt, became injured..”

At Roan’s words, George yelled with abusive language.

“So, son of a bitch………. You hit a noble because mere common soldiers died?”

“Mere common soldiers?”

Roan frowned.

George laughed as if he had gone half mad and continued saying.

“Right! You bastard! You dare to hit me because some of your trash like allies died? Huh? Huhuhu. The life of a noble is worth a lot more than those trash-like bastards! Kuhuhuhu.”

At that moment, Roan’s eyes shined with a red light.

That was a terrible killing intent.

“George Ant. Don’t badmouth the fallen ones. If you do it one more time…..”

An ice-cold voice replied back.

“I won’t leave you alone.”

It was a warning.

But George, who was half mad, wasn’t planning on stopping.

“Trash-like bastards. As you are also trash, you get……..”

He couldn’t continue speaking.

Spat!

The Regate Dagger split the air.

Stab!

A terrible sound rang out.

At the same time, the dagger stabbed George’s right hand.

“Uaak!”

George rose himself up along with his scream.

And Roan hit him in the face just like that.

Puk!

“Kuk!”

George felt severe pain and his breathing was labored.

Roan glared at him with cold eyes.

“Shut up. Next will be your neck.”

Chapter 98




Sponsored chapter

“Look over there!”

“Isn’t that Baron Ant?”

“Is it because he pulled back the camp as he wished?”

“He looks really messy.”

The HQ of Amaranth troop that was located in the center of Mediasis Village became really noisy.

Commanders and soldiers poured out and they all looked at one spot.

Amaranth.

It was a group of people holding the troop flag.

Roan was in front of them.

Behind him, one warhorse, that didn’t have a person on it, was moving.

A thick and taut rope was tied to the saddle.

The rope continued for a long way behind them.

“Pant. Pant.”

Rough breathing could be heard.

At the end of the rope, one man was walking exhaustively as if he was being dragged while he had his two arms and his body tightly tied up.

It was George Ant.

He looked really bad, but it was certainly Baron George Ant.

Right now he was a sinner who had committed a crime.

He had been dragged from the eastern region of Tale to Mediasis Village while he was tied up.

Behind George, two companies of the Amaranth troop were showing hostile looks.

Kiiiig!

The closed gates opened up.

As Roan went in first, the soldiers that were gathered up scattered to the sides.

“Even if he has the commanding and strategic rights, can a commoner troop commander treat a noble like that?”

“Don’t speak what you don’t know. The damages to our side is really big because of Baron Ant.”

“Even so, treating a noble like that is a bit….. Will the other nobles stay still?”

“I wonder. We have to check that.”

Worried expressions and mumbling sound roamed the HQ.

Roan didn’t tilt his ear at those words.

He had already decided what to do with George.

‘Because of George Ant, the entire defensive line crumbled.’

He had to set up a new defensive line to sweep up the monsters that had gotten past the defensive line.

Because of Viscount Tio Ruin, who moved fast enough, they could stop the monster’s charge for a bit.

And Roan didn’t miss that opportunity.

He used the information staff to send a new member to the nobles.

And the nobles of the east that had suffered great damages because of George, quickly reacted to Roan’s orders.

Thanks to that, a new defensive line could be set up.

‘Only, because we set up the defensive line a bit to the south, we ended up losing most of the north.’

It was the same as having to start the subjugation over again.

‘To not admit his mistakes and even mock the deaths of our allies in this situation.’

Ududuk.

Roan ground his teeth.

Then, a group of people appeared from a building located at the center.

‘The aides of the 1st prince and Prince Simon Rinse. On top of that, the nobles who arrived first.’

Roan summoned the nobles to the HQ right after they finished setting up the new defensive lines.

It was because of George’s punishment.

Roan unmounted with nimble movements and grabbed the reins.

One troop member quickly approached and took it for him.

“Roan.”

Simon’s expression wasn’t that good.

This was because he was extremely clear on the situation.

Roan saluted towards Simon and then looked at the expressions of the nobles behind him.

‘Most of them seem to show no interest. They look bothered by it. The only ones that are angry are the ones that suffered damages like Baron Rael Piad and Viscount Delph Blick.’

He had a bitter smile on his face.

They didn’t realize how severe the situation was.

‘I have to awaken them from their rotten thoughts.’

Roan looked at Simon fixedly.

“I will punish Baron George Ant.”

At those words, Simon inhaled and then nodded.

“Do so. You have the commanding and strategic rights for Tale.”

His expression was hard but his voice was soft.

‘It will be whipping at most.’

Even Simon thought like that.

You wouldn’t be able to treat a noble, and a noble leading a troop, beyond that.

And that wasn’t only Simon’s thoughts.

‘Even if he does that, what will he be able to do?’

‘He won’t be able to treat a noble of the kingdom as he pleases.’

‘He just has to imprison him for a few days.’

Most of the nobles thought that nothing would happen.

Because Roan wasn’t a noble like them, but a commoner.

Roan didn’t know what the nobles were thinking and sent an order to his troop members with a hand sign.

Soon, wooden chairs were placed in front of the building.

Simon sat in the upper seat and Roan took seat in front of him.

The nobles were seated next to him.

“Whew. Whew.”

George was still breathing roughly.

He was kneeled down on the ground.

But different from before, light returned into his eyes and his mouth was slightly raised up.

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“From now on, we will proceed with Baron George Ant’s punish…..”

When he talked up to that point.

“Do you think you will be safe after treating a noble like this?!”

An exasperated voice spoke out.

George, who had his head lowered until now, stared at Roan and yelled.

At the sudden situation, Simon and the nobles that were seated all had surprised expressions.

‘There are some nobles that are my acquaintances.’

George had something to trust in.

Now was a completely different situation to when he was alone with the Amaranth troop.

There were many nobles that would speak up for him.

And actually, some nobles mumbled with displeased expressions on their faces.

“Well, this is too much to do to a noble.”

“Is a noble a noble for nothing? Ahem.”

The atmosphere turned strange.

But even so, Roan’s expression was composed

He looked at George fixedly.

“Baron George Ant. You disregarded my orders as commander and moved the camp as you pleased, and gave great damages to your allies.”

“Hmph! The place I settled in was the safest!”

George spat out the words he had said before as an excuse.

Roan didn’t talk back and continued speaking.

“You also mocked the deaths of the soldiers.”

“Most of them were commoners! You wouldn’t know if you were a noble like me, the death of commoner bastards aren’t that important!”

George yelled up.

Murderous intent appeared in Roan’s eyes.

“Trash-like bastard. You still haven’t gotten a hold of yourself.”

He unsheathed the Regate Dagger from his waist.

“I, Roan, have received the commanding and strategic rights for the region of Tale by the 1st prince. At the same time, I have also received permission for your punishment.”

His voice became colder.

“George Ant, I will bring down the punishment for your sins.”

As he glanced, five members of the Amaranth troop approached and lined up behind George Ant.

The atmosphere wasn’t normal.

“What, what! What are you planning to do?!”

George tried to hide that he was scared by yelling aloud.

Puk!

Roan stabbed the dagger into the armrest of the chair.

“George Ant. I’m cutting off your ear because you didn’t follow the orders of the commander even after having heard it.”

“Wh, what?”

George asked back while became surprised.

And Simon and the others all had surprised expressions on their faces.

“Roan. Even so, cutting off the ear of a noble is a bit…….”

Simon slightly said.

He had a perplexed expression on his face.

But Roan didn’t even look back and answered.

“We have to cleanse the rotten parts. I am just following military discipline.”

“Mm. Even so……”

Simon tried to continue speaking.

However, Roan pulled out the Regate Dagger and looked at Simon.

“If you don’t want me to, I can give back the dagger and the commanding and strategic rights back to you.”

This was the strongest method.

Roan was betting everything on himself.

“Mm.”

Simon gulped.

He realized how outstanding of a commander Roan was while looking through several battles, strategies, tactics, and commands.

‘I can’t lose this kind of commander for a trash-like noble bastard.’

To win the competition for the throne, an existence like Roan would be more advantageous than a noble that didn’t have any abilities.

‘But if the other nobles become shaken because of this…….’

The entire base could shake.

Then, the closest people to Simon and the ones leading troops: Tio Ruin, Rael Piad, and Delph Blick, who had suffered damages thanks to George, abruptly stood up.

“My prince! Thanks to George Ant, a thousand soldiers died and more than a thousand were injured.”

“The sin that George commited can’t be forgiven, putting aside the ranks of nobles and the ranks of commoners.”

“The soldiers of my territory ended up getting annihilated.”

Statements of impeachments were pouring out of their mouths.

Tio kneeled down on one knee towards Simon.

“Military discipline is extremely strict on a battlefield. As you have given the commanding and strategic rights to Troop Commander Roan, I think that it’s proper to give him strength.”

Delph and Rael followed up.

“If the military crumbles, there is no more victory.”

The atmosphere changed in an instant.

Even the nobles that were protesting shut their mouths.

‘Viscount Tio Ruin.’

A faint smile appeared on Simon’s mouth.

He had read Tio.

‘You stood up for me in what I was pondering about.’

Thanks to that, the flow had changed.

‘The bastards that will still say noble this and noble that in this situation…..’

His eyes became fierce.

‘They are useless bastards.’

Even if they turned their backs and supported the 2nd or 3rd princes, he would applaud them.

‘These bastards who don’t have any ability and stick to living on their power are rather a big hole and a weak point.’

Simon let out a short sigh.

“Whew. The words of Tio Ruin, Delph Blick, and Rael Piad are right. The most important thing on a battlefield are the orders of a commander and discipline.”

He looked at Roan’s eyes fixedly.

“Roan. I was short in my thoughts and was shaken up for a bit. Do as you please.”

“Thank you.”

Roan replied with a short sigh and looked at George.

A long sigh flowed out from him.

‘I have received the prince’s permission.’

The gains of having bet everything was also clear.

He had received the clear support from Simon and the three nobles.

The nobles that were filled with displeasure couldn’t say anything anymore.

Roan made a handsign towards his troop members.

The troop members that were standing behind George, pressed down on his shoulders.

“Huh? Huh? Huh?”

George tried to struggle with a surprised expression on his face, but he couldn’t move at all.

He looked at the nobles in the surroundings with an earnest look.

“Ar, are you all going to watch? We are nobles!”

His voice quivered.

The nobles just closed their mouths and ignored George’s gaze.

“George Ant! Shut up and receive your punishment!”

Tio yelled with all of his strength.

“You garbage-like bastard!”

Rael’s curses followed up.

Meanwhile.

Srung.

One soldier pulled out a dagger.

“Uak!”

George yelled up at the chilly presence he felt behind his ear.

At that moment.

Uak!

Both of George’s ears were cleanly cut off along with a terrible sound.

“Uaaaak!”

George let out a scream close to despair.

Red blood flowed from both of his ears.

‘He, he really cut it off.’

‘He cut off the ears of a noble!’

The nobles and the surrounding soldiers all had surprised expressions.

‘There’s no difference of ranks in military discipline.’

‘If a noble makes a mistake, they also receive the same punishment!’

Every swallowed with their dry mouths and looked at Roan.

Then.

Roan, who had his mouth shut, grabbed the Regate Dagger once again.

“George Ant. I’m carving out your two eyes because of what you did, one eye is for being the commander in the defensive lines couldn’t read the flow of the battlefield properly and the other is for not marching out when monsters attacked the allied troops.”

“Huhuk!”

Even the surrounding nobles swallowed in silence.

Simon also became surprised, but as he had entrusted everything to Roan, he didn’t stand up.

“Uooooo!”

George became half insane.

The troop member holding the dagger quickly carved out his two eyes.

“Uaaaaaak!”

Despair followed up his screams of pain.

However Roan wasn’t planning to stop with just this much.

“George Ant. I’m cutting off your tongue because of having mocked the deaths of your allies.”

“Mmm.”

The nobles now had a pale faces.

They looked at George, who was covered in blood, with restless looks.

“Uok! Uk!”

George, whose tongue was grabbed, shook his head, but the members of the Amaranth troop firmly gripped his head so that he couldn’t move.

Slash.

As the dagger moved, the long tongue fell onto the ground.

“Kuk!”

He was now about to pass out from lack of oxygen.

George trembled like a person that was infected with malaria.

Roan looked at him and stood up.

His hands moved over to Travias spear.

“George Ant. Lastly, I will behead you for not having respected the military discipline set up by Rinse Kingdom.”

Cheng!

The spear showed itself along with the sound of metal.

The soldiers, who were grabbing onto George, firmly fell back.

“Uoooo.”

George trembled and started to straighten himself up from his kneeling position.

Roan swung Travias spear as if he had been waiting for this.

Slash!

The spear cleanly cut off the head.

A strange silence fell over the surroundings.

Meanwhile, Roan stabbed George’s head and raised it high into the sky.

It was a face that had it’s ears, tongue, and eyes cut off.

George’s head was covered in blood.

“Everyone listen closely. Military discipline applies to everyone in a fair way.”

Roan looked at the nobles and soldiers and said.

“I’m punishing the ones that commit sins and rewarding the ones that render merits.”

A declaration.

Everyone swallowed with their dry mouths at Roan’s words.

Especially the nobles, who were drunk on their power, seemed to have woken up.

‘A commoner troop commander has cut off the head of a noble but the prince isn’t saying anything.’

‘No, it wouldn’t be weird for the heads of anyone to get cut off.’

‘If I make a mistake, my head will also be cut off.’

The nobles touched their necks.

“Those are right words!”

“He didn’t say anything wrong!”

Tio, Delph, and Rael yelled with strength.

They were backing up Roan’s words so they couldn’t think of anything weird.

Roan handed over George’s head to the troop members.

“Place it on the entrance of the troop HQ and use it as an example.”

“Yes. We understand.”

A loud yell.

Respect was seen in the eyes of the Amaranth troop members.

‘Even the nobles of the kingdom couldn’t do anything in front of the troop commander.’

‘At least in the region of Tale, Troop Commander Roan is the best!’

Actually, even they hadn’t expected that he would come out this strongly.

Roan faintly smiled towards the troop members and then turned his head to look at Simon.

The camp still had the heavy silence over it.

Roan put back the Regate Dagger and kneeled down.

He was showing a really courteous attitude.

“I finished the punishment for George Ant.”

At those words, Simon got a hold of himself.

“It was an excellent decision.”

George was dead anyways.

As he decided to back up Roan, it would be better to be thorough with it.

Simon looked at the expressions of the nobles once and then smiled towards Roan.

“From now on, I will still entrust you with the merit rewards and the punishments for the region of Tale.”

“Thank you.”

Roan didn’t decline.

He knew how big of a weapon and what kind of strength this would give him.

“Then. Keep working hard from now on.”

Simon patted Roan’s shoulders and then returned to the troop building with his vassals.

Even the remaining nobles glanced everywhere and then disappeared towards their own buildings.

Roan, who was left alone, took in a deep breath.

‘Now even nobles won’t be able to disobey my orders.’

He had certainly overpowered their spirit.

He thought about the pale faces of the nobles.

‘Now that I have used the stick once, is it time to give them the carrot?’

Roan also knew that the nobles were the biggest support for Simon.

He had to stop them from shaking altogether.

The next plan was calmly set up in his head.

Then, a familiar face appeared amongst the soldiers surrounding him.

“Huh?”

Roan, that didn’t become surprised much, widely opened his eyes.

A really welcoming expression was seen on his face.

“Chris.”

“Troop commander.”

Chris, who was working in Pavor Castle as his stage, had appeared in Mediasis Village.

The two people held hands and didn’t speak for a long while.

The soft smile and warm eyes spoke instead of a conversation.

“Troop commander.”

After a while, Chris said with a low voice.

Roan nodded back.

Chris’s voice became even lower.

“There’s something I must check on.”

Roan just looked into Chris’s eyes.

Chris started to carefully speak.

“Even so, it seems like there’s a spy among the remaining nobles in Tale.”

*****

“So you are telling me to hold hands with Kallum?”

“Yes.”

It was a short answer.

But the expression of the man that answered was gentle.

“Mm.”

The youth who listened to the answer touched his chin with one hand and frowned.

‘So I have to hold hands with my younger brother……..’

“Count Chase. Are you saying that the situation in my brother Simon’s side is that good?”

“Yes. If it goes on like this, the 1st prince will really get ahead in the competition for the throne.”

The man with a serious expression was Count Jonathan Chase.

He spoke in a low voice as if he was whispering.

“Actually, the 1st prince is staying in the region of Tale that’s at the north of the lake. The one responsible for that place is someone called Roan, who beheaded Viscount Benjamin Doyle. As he has quite the ability, it seems like he is blocking the monsters in Tale really outstandingly.”

“How do you know that precisely?”

“When the thing of Viscount Doyle happened, I sent some commander underlings and made them infiltrate his troop.”

“Ah……..”

Tommy let out a low cry of exclamation.

His eyes shined.

“If we connect them with our own spies…..”

“No. It’s much better for them not to know of each other.”

Jonathan quickly shook his head.

“Because then, even if one side gets discovered, the other one will be able to stay alive.”

“Mm. That’s also right……..”

Tommy admitted it in an instant and nodded.

Jonathan let out a short sigh.

“Whew. For now, we have to concentrate on working together with the 3rd prince.”

“But will Kallum want to work with me?”

“That……”

A smile appeared on Jonathan’s face.

He spoke with a really confident expression.

“Send me to the 3rd prince. I will certainly convince him.”

“Oh! It seems like that you are confident.”

Tommy smiled brightly and nodded.

Jonathan kneeled down.

“I’m just doing my best for the prince.”

He had a really polite and well-mannered look.

Tommy nodded with a satisfied expression.

“Fine. I will entrust that to you. If this turns out well, I will give you a big reward.”

“Thank you.”

Jonathan hurriedly bowed.

The smile on his face became denser.

‘Kuk! Then, shall we start working earnestly?’

His eyes were kind of cold looking.

The kind that resembled the eyes of a snake.

Chapter 99




The black darkness.

Roan climbed a watchtower in the south by himself.

Even the stars and the moon were caught in the dim clouds.

‘A spy……’

The news Chris brought two days ago was quite shocking.

‘I thought that I could have as many normal soldiers as I wanted.’

But he hadn’t expected that there may be a spy among the nobles escorting Simon.

‘And two nobles leading troops at that.’

There were two spies which Chris revealed through the agency.

They were Baron Elton Coat and Baron Luke Aip.

Among them, Luke was the spy of Tommy Rinse and Elton of Kallum Rinse.

And the two people didn’t know the identity of each other.

‘On top of that, this isn’t the end.’

Chris expected that one of the two spies would have at least two more accomplices.

‘For now, it’s important to discover the spies that weren’t revealed.’

Until then, he was planning to move Luke and Elton to the rear camp.

He was planning to examine how they were communicating with their respective princes and find the ones that showed similar actions.

“Whew.”

Roan deeply sighed.

He had a feeling that the situation was becoming too complicated too suddenly.

His rank was still a troop commander but the things he was doing was the same things a noble did.

‘From here on, after getting rid of George Ant, all of the other nobles are checking up on me.

Actually, just cutting off George’s neck was a big provocation.

If Simon was swept up in political reasonings, he would have been chased out of the army or he could have even lost his life.

But Roan trusted his decision.

No, He believed in his eyes in sizing people up.

He thought that if it was Simon, who viewed personal ability with importance and was an ambitious person, he would take his side.

And fortunately, his gamble in betting everything on one side succeeded.

Simon had given wings to Roan.

Currently, most of the nobles were gulping down their complaints because of the declarations of Simon, Tio, and Rael.

Thanks to that, a strange atmosphere was flowing in the center of the troop’s HQ.

Even while following Simon’s orders and admitting Roan’s abilities, it was difficult to easily recognize Roan who was different from birth.

It was just like you were walking on thin ice.

‘Even so, obtaining the support of Baron Rael Piad is a great gain.’

Roan assigned all of George’s soldiers to Rael.

Rael, who lost all of tge soldiers he was commanding, became greatly moved at the unexpected treatment.

He thanked Roan in a big way and declared his support one more time.

‘Is it now time to catch the hearts of the other nobles too?’

He didn’t want to give them goods such as money or jewels.

‘I’m showing them my abilities.’

It would be an outstanding ability that would make them want to follow him.

He was planning to show them that.

Roan looked at the plains spread out above the watchtower.

Although there was darkness, Roan could see everything brightly as if it was midday thanks to Kalian’s Tear.

‘Now, shall we start enjoying this?’

He was planning to sweat a big one out.

His heart beat faster and his blood circulated quicker.

*****

First, Roan dispatched Luke and Elton to the northern boundary of Tale.

They couldn’t understand why they had to move to the rear, but Roan put up a believable excuse and convinced them.

That was because of George, they lost a lot of ground in the south and the range of the movements of the monsters were spread out in the north.

At the words that it was a really important task, Luke and Elton moved towards the north without saying anything else.

Followed by that, Roan summoned all the nobles and set up a new subjugation plan.

For now, there was a need to move the defensive line to the south, now that it was pushed from the north.

Roan entrusted this task to Tio Ruin, Delph Blick, and Rael Piad.

They were a force strongly supporting him.

And Roan decided to take the nobles that felt antipathy against him and subjugate the monsters in the south.

The nobles didn’t speak back and agreed on Roan’s opinions.

They had already seen what happened to George after ignoring his orders.

The next day Tio, Delph, and Rael left the HQ’s.

Simon, who had the largest force, led his troop and went on a personal subjugation around Mediasis Village.

Roan quickly gathered the remaining nobles and gathered for a conference.

“Based on the reports of the information squad…..”

When setting up tactics and strategies, they included the analyzed and gathered information of the information squad.

This tactic was also a really important one to Roan.

He was planning to show his abilities as a commander properly to the nobles that felt antipathy towards him.

He even took the night off to have a meeting with the centurions.

Roan smiled towards the nobles listening to his words.

‘I will show you that a battlefield can be designed.’

The conference continued like that for a while.

After a while, when the conference ended, the nobles started leave from the meeting room one by one.

“How was it? The conference we just had?”

“I wonder. It was a kind of groundless feeling. Honestly speaking, they were all nonsensical words.”

“It seems like he got many things right and got the nickname of ghost of the battlefield, and he got lost in that name.”

Several nobles thought of the meeting they just had and laughed, ridiculing him.

“Monsters will appear in the southern plains of Mediasis Village before the sun sets, so be prepared beforehand and just scare them?”

“I just have to be hidden in the weeds of the northeast. Then the scared monsters will certainly flee over there.”

“Even so, you are all better than me. I wonder. I just have to take 100 soldiers……”

“I……”

Several words came and went as if they couldn’t understand it at all.

“It seems like he’s trusting that information something too much.”

“Yeah. For now, let’s just wait until night-time.”

“If monsters really do appear.”

A cynical and fishy smile appeared on the faces of the nobles.

They hoped that Roan made a big mistake so he placed down the commanding and strategic rights.

And like that, the sun that was right above them started to move to the west little by little.

And just like a lie.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Jing! Jing! Jing!

The sound notifying the appearance of monsters was heard.

“Mo, monsters really appeared?!”

“It’s exactly before the sun set.”

“Mm.”

The nobles swallowed in silence with surprised expressions on their faces.

But they couldn’t stay like that forever.

“Charge!”

“Charge!”

They quickly charged like Roan’s orders.

Each commander that had 2,000 soldiers led their troop and charged out.

Roan stood at the watchtower and saw that.

A smile appeared in his face.

‘Everything will flow just like how I want it to.’

*****

The battlefield did indeed flow following Roan’s plans and expectations.

The monsters that appeared in the southern plains became perplexed at the attacks of the nobles and fled towards the weeds in the north.

But the nobles who received Roan’s orders were already waiting for them in ambush.

On top of that, the camps, traps, and obstacles they had set up before the exodus had started were being used everywhere.

Kiek!

The monsters scattered to the sides at the unexpected ambush.

“Don’t chase them! Our role is only up to this point!”

The soldiers that were waiting in ambush, protected their place instead of chasing after them.

A surprised look could be seen in their eyes.

‘Everything is happening like Troop Commander Roan had said.’

The monsters that fled while scattering to the sides had to change direction again while not being able to move much.

Roan had precisely read their route.

Soldiers that amounted to 100 and 500 were being placed on several roads.

Jing! Jing! Jing! Deng! Deng! Deng!

The surged flag few and the noisy jing and drum rang.

The monsters were surprised and ran towards the east where they couldn’t feel any presences.

The monsters that were scattered, gathered up once again.

And they finally arrived at the end of the eastern plains.

Their front was blocked with the harsh mountains and the surroundings only had long weeds.

“It’s really surprising.”

“The movements of the monsters are exactly the same as troop commander Roan had said.”

“I, is it possible to guess this precisely?”

They weren’t even humans, but monsters.

The monsters moved with instincts rather than rationality.

They were an existence that was that much harder to guess.

Then.

“They appeared precisely.”

“There’s not even an ounce of a mistake.”

The noble’s sights moved towards the west.

The high troop flag surged above the weeds.

Amaranth.

The Amaranth troop had appeared at the rear of the monsters.

At the same time.

Sweeeeek!

Thousands of arrows split the dark sky.

Pubububuk!

The dry weeds caught fire.

Kiiiek!

The monsters were swept up in flames in an instant.

And.

Tat!

Roan charged and entered the path of fire.

He had a valiant and overwhelming look.

Cheng!

Travias Spear became longer accompanied by the sound of metal.

Mana of a faint light flowed in the spear.

The Flamdor Mana Technique skyrocketed his body temperature.

Flaaaaame!

The fire burning the plains made Roan stronger.

Hwak!

On top of that, the red flames moved following Roan’s movements and spear as if they were dancing.

“Ah…”

“Ahhh.”

The nobles that were looking at that all opened their mouths with shocked expressions.

The fire danced alongside the spear.

That felt just like looking at the owner of fire, at the fire monarch.

Gulp.

Everyone gulped down their dry saliva.

As they saw Roan performing martial arts right before their eyes, one part of his heart became chilled.

‘Ri, right. The 1st prince wouldn’t have named an unsophisticated person as the one responsible for a region.’

‘Outstanding insight, strategy, and tactics. On top of that martial arts!’

They got goosebumps.

Meanwhile, the fire that was covering the monsters was dying out little by little.

The sound of the horn trumpet was heard as if it was waiting for this moment.

Puuuu!

At the same time, the Amaranth troop that was waiting at the rear, ran in.

They looked like they were charging while they were holding a small shield in front of them!

Bang!

The clash of Amaranth troop and the monsters.

The battle had just started, but it was already coming to an end.

The monsters weren’t an opponent for Roan and the Amaranth troop.

*****

The battle already ended with the complete victory for the Amaranth troop.

The monsters were exterminated without being able to properly resist.

Roan and the nobles returned to the HQ while leading their troops.

“Waaaa!”

“Amaranth! Amaranth! “

“Roan! Roan!”

The soldiers guarding the HQ cheered at the returning troops.

Roan went to the building of the troop with a composed expression.

And the nobles deployed in this battle followed his back.

Their expression was kind of awkward.

‘We did win, but I don’t know if we have to feel good or not.’

‘I had hoped that he would have slipped up.’

‘It feels like he just did everything alone.’

It was an uncomfortable feeling.

Then, Roan who sat at the upper seat of the conference room, stood up and saluted.

“We could win this battle thanks to you.”

He had a polite and well-mannered look to him.

“Huh?”

At the sudden situation, the nobles had puzzled expressions.

One of them spoke with a bit blunt voice.

“Isn’t Troop Commander Roan the one that raised the biggest merits anyways?”

At those words Roan shook his head.

“It was thanks to you performing your roles perfectly. I had just taken care of the remaining things. The ones that raised the biggest merits this time……”

He paused for a moment and bowed once again.

“It’s you.”

“Ahem.”

Awkward coughs were heard everywhere.

They hadn’t expected to hear Roan complimenting them here.

‘He isn’t that bad of a guy.’

They slightly thought like that.

‘On top of that, the martial arts we saw on the battlefield was also outstanding.’

‘He’s a guy that has the possibilities to become bigger than this.’

‘After the subjugation ends, he may be able to become a noble.’

Then, Roan’s voice was heard.

“I will record this well and report it when the merit awards happen.”

“Ahem. This wasn’t that much. Hahaha.”

It was a laugh that seemed like they didn’t dislike what they heard.

The nobles were satisfied.

Currently, Roan was receiving Simon’s support and recognition.

If that Roan reported the merits himself, there was a high possibility to catch Simon’s eyes.

‘It’s a good opportunity.’

‘Right. If it’s only for this, we can still pretend to be on good terms with Roan.’

The nobles smiled in satisfaction and nodded.

But of course, not all the nobles were thinking of the same thing.

‘Hmph! Insignificant bastard.’

‘Is he using the carrot and the stick? Hmph!’

Displeasure was seen in some nobles.

But they forced themselves to not show it.

Because it was still Roan who was the responsible one for Tale.

‘Anyways, some are showing goodwill.’

Roan looked at the expressions of the nobles and put on a smile.

He knew that he wouldn’t be able to capture the hearts of the nobles with just this amount of his show of the carrot and the stick.

But the relationship of pulling and pushing the nobles had just started.

‘I will make you not be able to get a hold of yourselves.’

A faint smile appeared on his face.

Roan stood up and slightly bowed.

“Everyone, you have done great today.”

The after-battle conference ended like that.

The nobles started to move out of the room one by one.

And some of them even approached Roan and shook hands.

Roan, who was left alone, didn’t rest and took out a thick roll of paper.

Even when big and small battles were occurring, he didn’t neglect studying.

‘There are still a lot of lacking points.’

There were many things he couldn’t do with just his talent and effort in his past life.

Because of that, he lost his life as a squad commander.

But in this life, he became responsible for a region and was able to dream of something bigger.

‘I have to learn more, and put in more effort.’

He needed to have a grand foundation.

He didn’t want to become someone that only shined.

“Well, shall I organize the situation of the 2nd and 3rd princes for now?”

Roan grabbed a pen and took in a deep breath.

Scribble. Scribble.

For a while, only the sound of the pen’s scribbling was heard from the conference room.

“Hahaha!”

Simon boisterously laughed and nodded.

He was really satisfied with the current situation.

Even when the defensive line was greatly pushed to the south because of George Ant, he thought that the subjugation was going in the wrong direction.

On top of that, because Roan got rid of George, the internal conditions greatly shaken up.

If this was notified to the political circle, several nobles could have expelled him.

At the slip, he could get this entire base shaken up.

Simon soon contacted his supporter, Bradley Webster.

Bradley, who was keeping the other dukes in check, moved quickly at Simon’s call.

He roamed among the society of Miller and spread George Ant’s self-indulgent attitude and incapabilities.

He didn’t only do that, but he also exaggerated Roan’s merits, who he had selected and was supporting and reported it to several nobles of the royal palace.

Thanks to that, Simon was rumored to be an insightful person that recognized someone with ability and also as a brave general.

But of course, the one getting the most interest was Roan.

Roan had started to spread his name even when he didn’t know that was happening.

‘The only problem left are my two brothers…….’

After the subjugation ends, Tommy and Kallum will probably bet on the case where Roan cut off George’s head.

‘But by then it will already be too late. Huhuhu.’

He had a method he had thought of.

Simon’s eyes twisted scarily.

‘For them to grab hands .’ (E/N: join together)

He hadn’t expected for his two brothers to join forces.

Thanks to that, the difference between him and his brothers wasn’t that wide.

‘Even so, it’s clear that I’m far ahead of the subjugation.’

Even if he wasn’t immediately named as the successor for the throne, he would be a lot further in the competition.

‘I did well in entrusting Roan with Tale.’

This was all thanks to Roan.

Roan grasped everything that happened in the region of Tale as precisely as if it was happening on his palms and moved according to it.

Thanks to that, different from the other regions, the monsters in Tale couldn’t even properly raise their spirits up.

The defensive line that was pushed to the north was set up again in the south, where Poskein Lake was, and the monsters that were fiercely stirring also started to reduce as more time passed.

‘It’s about time the subjugation ended.’

His chest swelled up.

“Hahaha!”

Simon couldn’t endure it anymore and burst out in laughter.

The commander of the knights Ralph Tains, who was escorting him from the back, smiled brightly.

Then, someone knocked on the door.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

At the same time, a welcoming voice was heard.

“Oh! Come in.”

Right after he permitted it, Roan entered the room.

Although he did seem tired because of the continued battles, his eyes were still shining brightly.

“Hahaha! Roan. It seems like the subjugation is beginning to end! The number of monsters has decreased a lot! Hahaha!”

“Right. What did you come for today?”

He asked back after he laughed aloud.

If he had a favor, he was planning to listen to everything.

Simon was that happy and was reveling in his victory.

On the other side, Roan’s expression was quite dark.

“Strange information has come to us.”

“Information?”

Simon frowned.

Roan continued saying with a calm voice.

“Even so, we will have to make the defenses more solid.”

“Why that so suddenl……..”

Recently, the number of monsters had decreased by a lot.

And Simon thought that the subjugation was coming to an end.

But Roan had rather said that they should strengthen their defenses.

He couldn’t understand it at all.

Roan took in a breath and slowly replied.

“It seems like the monsters are preparing for the last strike.”

His low voice contrasted the silence that followed.

Roan’s eyes shone.

He couldn’t say it honestly but it was now time for that to happen.

‘Now the final exodus will start.’

Chapter 100




“Mm.”

Simon swallowed his saliva contrasting the silence.

His happy face had now become dark.

“That more monsters that have appeared until now will pour out?”

“Yes. Based on what was analyzed by the information squad, it seems like there will be at least five times as many monsters.”

Roan replied calmly.

He knew that the final exodus happened in the last three days thanks to the memories of his past life.

Thanks to that, making up the information and convincing Simon wasn’t a difficult thing.

“Will you be able to stop it?”

His question came straight to the point.

Roan nodded.

“There are no problems.”

It was true.

You wouldn’t know if you were annihilated because you didn’t know, but in a situation where you knew it would happen, the preparations for it had already been finished.

Only, what had Roan worried wasn’t the region of Tale.

“We have to notify the other regions.”

“Right. We should.”

Simon smiled faintly and nodded in reply.

Right now, he wasn’t only in charge of the region of Tale that was located towards the north of the lake.

At least for the other nobles supporting him, there was a need to notify them of this a bit quicker.

But what Roan wanted didn’t amount to only that.

He took in a breath for a moment and then carefully spoke.

“We also have to notify the sides of the 2nd and 3rd princes.”

“Mm?”

Simon frowned.

Roan quickly added.

“The two princes will also think that the stir of the monsters has ended. And naturally, the defenses will also become sloppy. In this situation, if five times the number of monsters appear, the region around the lake would become a mess. And the citizens that were relieved in the subjugation will also suffer great damages.”

“Mm.”

Simon gulped in the silence.

‘Those things are important even when the competition for the throne is happening?’

He knew that Roan had great interest in the lives and well-being of the citizens, as a commoner troop commander.

But he hadn’t expected that he would worry about their safety in this situation.

‘If Tommy and Kallum can’t properly react to it, they would suffer a big blow and I would become even more advantageous.’

It was true that Simon was more open-minded about ranks than other nobles.

But for this, he was an ambitious person.

To climb on the throne, he would make even the cruelest and most horrendous choices.

‘Even so, there’s no need to make Roan feel bad here.’

Roan was really outstanding.

He was someone he had to bring with him until he climbed up to the throne.

Simon erased the displeased look on his face and put on a faint smile.

“I understand. I will send a message to my two brothers.”

“Thank you.”

Roan was still bowing, so he didn’t realize Simon’s change in expression.

“Then, I will be going now.”

There were many things he had to do with the final exodus in front of him.

Roan saluted and then moved out of the room.

“Whew.”

Simon let out a long sigh.

The escorting knight, Ralph Tains who was behind him, asked in a low voice.

“Will you really send the message?”

At those words, Simon snorted.

“Hmph. I can’t do that. For me, it’s the perfect opportunity. As we have to trick Roan’s eyes, just pretend to send it.”

“Yes. I understand.”

Ralph bowed and left the room after replying.

Simon, who was left alone, fell into his thoughts.

‘Roan. Your insight and ability is outstanding, and you treat your underlings really well. On top of that, you have a good heart and even love the citizens. But…….’

That kind of temperament was only suitable in times of peace.

‘You will have to get a bit dirty.’

If that wasn’t the case, he may stand up against him at the final point.

Simon closed his eyes.

‘Roan. At least until I become the king, stay next to me.’

After that?

That was something that only Simon knew.

*****

“Then. They are trusting you without any doubts?”

“Yes. They are.”

A handsome youth and a middle aged man were sharing a conversation in a low voice.

The youth was the 3rd prince of Rinse Kingdom, Kallum Rinse, and the man was surprisingly enough, one of the spies of Tommy Rinse, Viscount Jonathan Chase.

“Brother Tommy acts all intelligent but he’s a really sloppy person. Hahaha.”

“If it wasn’t only for Duke Edwin Voisa, he would have already been eliminated from the competition for the throne.”

A fishy smile appeared on Jonathan’s mouth.

His eyes were certainly smiling, but it gave off a kind of cold feeling.

Tommy wouldn’t be imagining it at all.

That Jonathan, who proposed joining hands with Kallum Rinse, was actually a spy for Kallum.

“Prince.”

Jonathan’s nose frowned.

Kallum’s eyes shone.

“It seems like you have thought of something good?”

He knew that every time Jonathan had something good in mind, he frowned his nose.

And Jonathan nodded.

“There are two spies in the camp of the 1st prince that belong to the 2nd prince.”

“I know that.”

“And there are also two on our side.”

“Right.”

Kallum thought of the nobles he had won over to his side and nodded.

Jonathan’s voice became more covert.

“Send a letter to them and slightly leak the identity of the spies of the 2nd prince.”

“Oh!”

Kallum let out a low exclamation.

Jonathan continued speaking.

“If rumors enter the eyes of the 1st prince, then he won’t stay still at all.”

“Right. He would make a fuss to cut the heads off of those bastards.”

At Kallum’s words, the smile on Jonathan’s mouth became even fishier.

“And the spies of the 2nd prince wouldn’t just stay still.”

“Make the two sides fight each other?”

“Yes. We are just watching how the fight proceeds.”

A weird laugh was heard.

Kallum slapped his knees with his hands.

“Good. Start it right away.”

“Yes! Just leave it to me.”

Jonathan bowed deeply.

An ambitious fire appeared in his cold eyes.

‘The one to become the next king is the 3rd prince.’

Abilities or quality wasn’t important at all.

The only one among the three princes that could do as they pleased was Kallum.

And among the nobles of Rinse, the one with the most ambitions could be Jonathan.

No, perhaps, his ambition would be the same as Simon’s.

*****

A night which had a blue moon.

This was the night the final exodus started.

The first day really resembled hell.

The monsters poured out of the lake with cries.

They overflowed out of the lake as if they were really excited, no, perhaps stricken in fear.

But the northern region of Poskein Lake had solid preparations thanks to Roan.

Arrows poured over the heads of the monsters that appeared from the lake.

At the same time, fire surged up from their feet.

But this wasn’t the end.

Tens, hundreds of oil barrels floated over the lake.

The monsters that tried to get out of the water couldn’t move freely and had their legs tied up.

And above them, long spears that were set on fire flew.

Babang!

Poskein Lake became a sea of fire with a loud explosion.

It was a really perfect defense.

Even so, the monsters pouring out of the lake started to push the defensive lines little by little and charged towards the ground.

The number of monsters was that overwhelming.

But Roan didn’t confront them head on.

They repeated hit and run tactics, and led the really excited monsters into traps and the troop’s bases.

Thanks to that, the monsters couldn’t properly resist and started to become exterminated little by little by the surprise attacks and traps.

“It’s the Amaranth troop!”

“Open the gates!”

The guards that were left in Mediasis Village yelled with all of their strength.

They had discovered the Amaranth troop approaching from the end of the southern plains.

And Roan was at the front of them.

“Amaranth! Amaranth!”

“Roan! Roan!”

The Amaranth troop put the pouring cheers behind them and went to the HQ located at the center of the village.

Roan and the Amaranth troop, who should have been facing the monsters at the front lines, had appeared.

That was because of Simon’s call.

‘What happened so suddenly?’

Roan looked at the building in the center and tilted his head.

Although he was blocking the monsters well, it wasn’t a situation where he could have some leisure.

Thanks to that, he had left his main force in the front and came with only two companies.

“Have some rest and reorganize your stuff.”

“Yes. Understood”

Roan laid down the order to the troop members and went to Simon’s office.

It was the first visit since he came to report about the final exodus several days ago.

“Mm. You finally came.”

Simon raised his head with a stiff expression.

‘It seems like it’s a really serious thing……’

Roan looked at Simon’s expression and took in a deep breath.

Originally Simon was roughless and magnanimous.

He had never seen an expression like this before.

“I came after receiving your call.”

Roan stood in front of Simon and saluted.

Simon gave him some papers instead.

“Read it.”

Roan slowly read down the contents on the paper.

“Mm.”

‘Just what……’

The paper was a kind of letter.

It was sent by Baron Elton Coat, who was in charge of the northern boundary.

‘That Baron Luke Aip and Baron Mito Posis are spies for the 2nd prince…..’

Surprisingly enough, Elton revealed the identities of the spies that Tommy Rinse had planted through the letter.

On top of that, he even added proof that they were working for the 2nd prince.

“What do you think?”

Simon was locking his fingers while lowering his head a bit.

He couldn’t see his expression but it felt rough and heavy, as if his voice would explode at any time.

“I wonder…….”

Roan paused the last words.

It wasn’t because he couldn’t be certain or not about Elton’s words being true.

‘Right two days ago, we grasped the identity of the spies of the 2nd prince through the agency.’

The names of the spies Chris confirmed were Luke Aip and Mito Posis.

It coincided with the contents of Elton’s letter.

But there was another problem.

‘It’s that Baron Elton Coat is a spy working for the 3rd prince.’

The side of the 3rd prince had revealed the identity of the 2nd prince.

Roan thought that this would have some kind of meaning.

‘On top of that, we still couldn’t find the spy hiding from the 3rd princes side.’

According to the analysis of the agency, there should be one more.

Because of several reasons like this he couldn’t make any decision.

“In my eyes, they seem true.”

Simon’s voice.

It was still rough and heavy.

Roan placed down the paper and replied.

“Even so, I will have to investigate myself to know.”

He showed a careful reaction for now.

One brow of Simon twisted.

“Really? Then, will you go talk to him yourself?”

And then, he shook his right hand.

Ralph Tains, who was at standing at the back, fell back and then appeared with another middle-aged man that had a familiar face.

‘Baron Elton Coat.’

The man with a nervous expression was the one that sent the letter and the one defending the northern villages because of Roan’s orders, Elton.

Simon stood up and made a gesture with his chin.

“Roan. If you have something to ask, do it now. If those results end up being revealed as truth…..”

His eyes got bloodshot.

“I will behead Luke and Mito myself.”

At that moment, a nasty murderous intent was felt.

Roan breathed quickly and slowly blinked.

‘Anyways, Elton Coat is also a spy.’

He was planning to reveal the spies of the 3rd prince through this opportunity.

And to do that, there was a need to protect Luke and Mito for now.

‘There’s nothing more ridiculous than a spy with their identity exposed.’

Roan chewed down his lips and looked at Elton.

“Sir Baron Coat. How did you know that these two people are working for another prince?”

“That…….”

Elton paused for a moment and then started to answer with clear words.

“I realized it after I started to defend the villages in the north with Luke Aip along with you. As we were quite close, I started to see some strange things.”

“Specifically?”

“He started to send letters with Baron Mito Posis, who he didn’t have any relationship with, and people came to find him from outside of the Tale region.”

Half was true and half was a lie.

Luke and Mito had never sent and received letters.

Only, there were some times that people sent by the 2nd prince Tommy, came to find Luke.

The agency and the information squad didn’t miss that and it was revealed that Mito Posis was the other noble hidden as a spy after he started to show similar actions.

Roan, who already knew everything, asked back in a calm expression.

“If you see this, here is every letter sent by the 2nd prince and Baron Luke Aip, so how did you get this?”

“While I was patrolling, I discovered a suspicious person and thus, caught him. But this came out of his chest.”

This was a clear truth.

‘Actually, Viscount Jonathan Chase should have sent a separate one.’

Elton put on a smile.

Roan kept asking several things in detail after that.

And every time, Elton answered with confidence and without a hint of hesitation.

Just as if he had already prepared and memorized it.

Then.

Bang!

Simon, who was looking at this from the side, couldn’t hold it in anymore and smacked the table.

His face was red.

“Roan. If it’s this much, there’s no need to listen to it anymore!”

His voice trembled.

He had a look where he was forcefully holding back his rage.

“I will immediately cut down this trash-like bastard!”

A killing intent, like a storm, came rushing in.

‘Fine. Done. Good.’

Elton yelled out in delight.

But it was lacking with this.

‘I will also have to spill this in the side of Aip and Posis.’

If he didn’t do so, there was a high possibility for this to get cleaned up easily.

‘It will end when the prince calls them to the HQ and captures them.’

That wasn’t what Elton and the 3rd prince Kallum wanted.

‘They have to clash swords and fight. Kukuk.’

It was funny just thinking about it.

Then, Roan who was silent, said in a calm voice.

“That’s impossible.”

At that moment, the cold atmosphere became even colder.

Simon’s face contorted with rage.

“What did you say right now?”

“Prince, think of the order of things. Monsters five times the normal amount are pouring out. For now, wait until the subjugation ends.”

Roan looked at Simon’s eyes fixedly.

‘If we get rid of them now, we won’t be able to find the spy of the 3rd prince.’

The moment the neck of the 2nd prince’s spies were cut off, the other spies would all be able to live.

“If Baron Aip and Baron Posis resist roughly, our entire force will break up. And in the end, we will take a blow by the monsters.”

“Mm.”

Simon swallowed in silence with an uncomfortable expression on his face.

He didn’t like that he had to wait to get rid of the traitors that served him by his side and not be able to do it immediately.

But Roan’s words were true for several things.

‘Even if we do catch Luke and Mito, they can reveal themselves……’

As he saw that Simon was calming down his rage, Roan nailed down a wedge.

“Four days!”

“…….”

“I will end up the subjugation in exactly four days!”

Roan’s expression was calm.

There were now two days remaining in the final exodus.

If he took a day to take care of the remnants and another day to retrieve the battlefield, the subjugation would end.

“Fine. Roan. I will do as you say. Instead…”

Ududuk.

The sound of gritting teeth was heard.

“I won’t kill them that easily.”

Elton, who was looking at that, frowned.

‘Damn! That damned bastard!’

His sight moved over to Roan.

His plans that were about to succeed became foam.

‘Bastards that isn’t helpful at all……..’

When he thought up to that point.

Roan smiled bitterly and looked at Elton.

“Baron Coat, keep checking on the actions of Baron Luke Aip.”

Elton hid his thoughts and nodded.

“I understand. I will check up on him carefully.”

Elton nodded with a resolute expression.

A damnable act.

‘I have to reveal the spy of the 3rd prince as quickly as possible.’

He had to urge the agency and the information squad.

There were only four more days that remained.

‘Then I’m taking care of Luke, Mito, Elton, and the remaining one at the same time.’

Roan’s eyes shone.

Complicated plans were consecutively being raised up in his head.

Chapter 101




Baron Elton Coat returned to the region in the north.

And staff of the agency trailed his back.

Following and trailing.

Roan laid the order of tilting the force of the 3rd prince through the leak of the spy.

And fortunately, the agency was already investigating the people that had visited Elton’s camp.

They were analyzing if there was someone that had visited the camp of another noble.

‘I just have to entrust and believe.’

Roan entrusted the case of the noble spy to the agency and went to the south while leading his troop once again.

He had to end the final exodus the quickest possible.

‘I have to at least avoid internal disturbance.’

They had now started to make some distance with the 2nd and 3rd prince.

But if a battle occurs while they are finding out the spies, that difference would close in an instant.

‘Now that I see……’

Light shone in Roan’s eyes.

‘Didn’t prince Simon connote nobles at the side of the other princes?’

He wasn’t someone that would be sitting around.

‘Rather, he would have gone farther…..’

Although the three people had different mothers, they all had the same father.

But the enmity between them was more severe than thought.

‘The closer I get to the royal palace, the memories of my past life become useless.’

In his past life he hadn’t gotten along with a prince, noble or a high ranked person.

Thanks to that, the closer he got to Simon and the more magnanimous the things occurring around him became, his memories about the future wouldn’t help him at all.

‘I can only use what I remember now to the utmost. And……’

His mouth slightly rose.

‘It’s time for the ones called geniuses to appear in the entire continent.’

Roan was planning to gather the most essential ones faster than anyone.

And there were some people he could think of.

‘By the way, how will Pierce be doing?’

A genius among geniuses.

He remembered Pierce, that had naturally followed Reil Baker.

But after Poskein exodus started, he hadn’t heard anything about Reil and Pierce going to battle.

‘Did they go to another country? Or deep in the mountains?’

As Reil was a really unguessable person, his training methods wouldn’t be normal at all.

‘The day Pierce returns……’

The smile in his mouth became even denser.

‘I’m obtaining the strongest commander in the continent.’

His heart felt proud.

‘I also have to become someone comparable to him.’

Roan gripped the reins.

He unconsciously kicked the horse at the surging emotions.

Hiiiiing!

The cry of the horse was heard clearly.

Dudududu.

The warhorse ran towards the south.

He wasn’t simply running across the road right now.

He was running towards the future spread in front of him.

*****

“Damn. It’s difficult in this situation.”

Elton clenched his fists and cursed out.

He fell in his thoughts after returning to the northern village.

‘I thought that prince Simon would behead Luke and Mito without even looking back!’

He didn’t know that he would listen to the words of a commoner troop commander, even if he favored him.

‘If I can’t finish this, I’m getting out of the eyes of prince Kallum.’

If he made a mistake, he could get his merits taken by one of his allies.

‘What to do……’

He felt anxious.

Then, troop commander Tony that was looking at the side, said with a careful expression.

“Sir baron.”

“What?”

There was annoyance filled in his words.

Tony forced a smile and continued speaking.

“Let’s send a letter to prince Simon again.”

“A letter?”

“Yes. That the movements of Luke Aip’s army isn’t normal.”

“Mm.”

Elton gulped.

His face became a bit bright.

“Troop commander Roan left to the front lines of the south. On top of that, most of the forces of prince Simon left the HQ. If we make a surprise attack on him now, prince Simon will fall in a really dangerous situation.”

“There’s no way Luke Aip will do that if he’s not mad!”

As Elton yelled, Tony approached even more.

“That’s right. Baron Luke Aip will obviously not do that. But isn’t it enough if only prince Simon is told that?”

Only then did Elton’s head become bright.

The key was making Simon believe it like that.

He was setting up the information and inducing him.

Tony’s voice became a bit faster.

“Say that Luke Aip realized that his identity got revealed. And because of that, they have to attack before they get attacked by Aip’s army. On top of that, if we say that we should attack them blocking their front and back and be able to capture him easily, he will probably charge out without even looking back.”

“Mm. That’s not a bad plan.”

No, it was more outstanding than what he thought.

But Tony’s thoughts didn’t end here.

“If we slightly spill this to baron Mito Posis, won’t he show some movements too?”

This was similar to what Elton had thought.

“What about Luke Aip?”

At those words, Tony shook his head.

“Baron Aip is currently in charge of the northern boundary. Because of that, there’s a possibility for him to flee immediately when things go wrong. Compared to him baron Posis is in charge of the east. It’s a place where fleeing is impossible. Baron Posis that’s already caught in a mouse trap……..”

“Will try to bite the cat.”

Elton smiled faintly and closed one eye.

“That’s right.”

Tony replied and nodded.

Elton patted Tony’s shoulders with a satisfied expression.

“Good. That’s a nice one.”

He gave him a yellow paper and a pen.

It was to write the letter to send Simon.

Elton’s expression, that was really stiff, became bright.

The long pen moved as if it was dancing.

Tony was looking at that with a bit nervous expression.

Then Elton’s voice was heard.

“This thing, if it finishes well I will also reward you.”

At that moment, Tony’s mouth became so long it was about to touch his ears.

He shut his mouth and bowed deeply.

His head and shoulders trembled.

Ambition of different sizes clashed and danced.

*****

The final exodus was soon meeting its end.

The monsters that were overflowing got lead to the traps and troop’s bases started to get exterminated by Roan that striked back earnestly.

He mustered Simon’s troop and the noble’s armies and laid the order to charge towards the lake.

“Kiek!”

“Kigik!”

The monsters fell with their last words.

Cpluk!

Above them, the charge of the soldiers was followed.

“Kill!”

“Drive them back to the lake!”

The yell of the commanders mixed with the cries of the soldiers.

Puuuuuu! Dung! Dung! Dung! Jing! Jing! Jing!

The sound of the horn trumpet, drums and jings was heard.

The battlefield was fierce and sharp.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh.”

And the damages on the soldier wasn’t normal as well.

The instincts of a beast to protect their territory.

They stepped over the corpses of the fallen ones and fought the monsters.

Kieeek!

The monsters got perplexed.

They had never faced humans that were this united on something.

The guys that were charging fiercely started to get pushed little by little.

‘They are falling back!’

Roan didn’t miss this opportunity.

“Advance! Charge through!”

He jumped over the monsters while holding Travias spear.

Spat!

The spear danced and sliced over the bodies of the monsters.

Every time Roan swung his spear three or four monsters lost their heads and fell.

“Follow troop commander!”

“Don’t get behind!”

Amaranth troop charged over from the scattered lines.

“E, eit! Follow Amaranth troop!”

“We are also going!”

The other nobles followed Amaranth troop late.

A charge similar to a raging billow.

The monsters didn’t have any strength or spirit to resist anymore.

They crumbled like that and got exterminated.

*****

“Treat the injured ones!”

“Move the corpses of the monsters to the south, the corpses of our allies to the north!”

Sounds retrieving the battlefield was heard everywhere.

A bad smell and black smoke.

Red blood covered the entire ground.

But the expressions of the soldiers that were standing was really bright.

They got a hunch.

‘The subjugation ended!’

‘Monsters don’t appear anymore in Poskein lake!’

They had survived from the hell like battlefield.

The soldiers laid down on the ground that was covered by blood and patted each other’s shoulders.

A small comfort between the surviving ones.

Roan stood on top of the battlefield and looked at that.

‘Saving at least one more life of those soldiers is my role and task as the responsible one.’

It wasn’t a simple victory, but a perfect one.

Roan dreamt of that.

He slowly raised his head to look at the sky.

The sky was lit up in red light just like the ground that was covered in blood.

‘I wanted to see a blue sky.’

A bitter smile appeared in his face.

Then.

“Troop commander!”

An urgent voice.

It was Austin.

Roan turned his head to the direction the voice was heard at.

At that moment.

“Mm?”

His sight passed over the perplexed expression of Austin and went behind him.

The smoke of the beacon burning black.

‘Why a beacon?’

The monsters were already perfectly exterminated.

No, before that, the direction the beacon was lit up was suspicious.

‘It’s coming from the north.’

A beacon has surged up on Mediasis village that had the troop’s HQ and was picked as a safe zone.

‘Something’s not right.’

His face stiffened up.

He ran towards his horse and yelled.

“Amaranth troop! Prepare to charge out!”

A sound waking up the recently fallen asleep soldiers.

The soldiers that were laying down lined up and organized themselves.

A surprisingly enough look.

“Oh!”

The soldiers of the other nobles let out exclamations of admirement.

Roan kicked his horse and went to baron Rael Piad.

“Sir baron Piad! I request for the retrieval of the battlefield!”

“Don’t worry about here.”

Rael hit his chest with his right hand.

Viscount Tio Ruin also prepared to charge out late.

He also felt that something wasn’t right.

Roan pointed towards the north with Travias spear.

“Charge!”

A loud yell.

Soon, Amaranth troop started to move with Roan at the front.

Even when they were exhausted, their movements was fast.

To the point they left behind Tio Ruin’s troop that charged out right after them.

Roan didn’t wait for Tio.

They had to return to the HQ the fastest possible because they didn’t know what situation it was.

How much would they have ran.

Roan, that was at the front, pulled the reins.

He saw the staff of the agency running towards him.

‘What happened that even the staff……..’

After a while, the staff that approached yelled with all their strength.

“The, the prince! The prince has charged out! He went to the northern villages with only count Lancephil accompanying him!”

At that moment, Roan’s face stiffened.

The staff that got nearer in that while said in a low voice.

“The bigger problem is that baron Mit oPosis, that was protecting the eastern region, is moving to the north.”

Boom!

A feeling he got hit in the back of his head.

The staff members all lowered their heads.

“We are sorry. It seems like there was a hole on the surveillance of Mito Posis.”

But Roan didn’t blame them.

He knew that it wasn’t the fault of the staff.

‘We lacked people because we were finding the spy of the 3rd prince.’

On top of that, now wasn’t the time to worry about things that had already past.

‘Even if they say the prince and the army of count Lancephil, they only amount to 4.000.’

The other soldiers were dispatched to subjugate the monsters.

‘Compared to that, the numbers of Mito and Luke are more than 5.000.’

Because the numbers of Mito Posis was more than 3.000.

‘It’s obvious that baron Elton Coat will just pretend to help the prince and just watch the situation.’

No, perhaps, he may bare his fangs when he gets certain he can catch Simon.

‘The prince and count Lancephil are in danger!’

Roan ground his teeth.

WHen Elton first revealed the nobles working for the 2nd prince, Roan was even planning to tell Simon that Elton was actually a spy working for the 3rd prince.

But in the end he didn’t.

‘With the temperament of the prince, we would have beheaded him on the spot.’

It was obvious that if that happened, the situation would turn more difficult.

But thinking about it now, he felt a bit of regret in his judgement.

‘For him not being able to endure it for 2 days.’

Roan turned back and yelled.

“Infantry, return to the HQ! Ride on the remaining war horses and come to the village of the north!”

“Yes! Understood!”

As soon as he laid the order spearmen and archers ran towards Mediasis village.

Roan looked at the 300 soldiers that remained and took a deep breath.

‘I did good on teaching them cavalry.’

There was a need to increase their movement because the number of soldiers was too lacking compared to the region they were in charge of.

Thanks to that, most of the troop members of Amaranth knew how to ride a horse.

But of course, their level was poor.

Roan gripped a rein and raised his spear high to the sky.

“We are going to the north!”

There was no need to pass over Mediasis village.

Their destination was the village in the north.

Their objective was rescuing Simon and Io.

*****

“Please, reconsider this prince.”

Io said really carefully.

But Simon, that was grabbing the reins, didn’t reply at all.

He was glaring at the north with a cold gaze.

Io let out a short sigh.

He knew that the situation wasn’t normal, but now was the time to protect the troop’s HQ.

Even if Aip’s army came attacking them just like Elton’s report, they would be able to plentily block them.

On top of that, if Roan and his troop regrouped, they would be able to take care of the traitors in an instant.

‘He just had to endure it for two more days……’

But as soon as Simon received Elton’s report, he lead his troop and charged out.

Io, that was returning from his patrol got surprised and also went out, but he couldn’t convince him.

‘He’s actually a really smart person……’

Simon despised people that betrayed him or talked bad about him in his back.

No, it was rage to the point he wanted to tear them off.

‘Whew. It must be because of his majesty.’

When Simon was young, he received the love and favor of the current king, Deni Von Rinse.

But every time Deni took in a new bride and gave birth to a new princess, he poured all his care and he ended up becoming cold rice.

‘He polished his studies and martial arts to get some interest from the king, but…….’

Deni III rather made more distance with Simon.

He felt burdened by his son that had abruptly grown.

It was since then.

Simon started to show obsession on his things, his people

“I can see the northern village.”

Just in time, Ralph Tinse the captain of the knights, said.

Simon opened his eyes sharply and laid a chilly order.

“Capture Luke Aip.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Ralph replied with all his voice and pulled his sword.

“Charge!”

The force close to 2.000 people that were following the orders ran towards the village.

‘Elton will attack at the back of the village.’

Simon trusted in Elton.

That’s why he had gone out with a small force.

A troop sticked to the fences of the villages with Ralph at the front.

Aip’s army got confused at the sudden attack but in the end they took formation.

The battle that had nothing to do with the subjugation started like that.

‘Luke. I will cut off that sly tongue of yours.’

Simon felt great rage at the truth of one of the underlings he appreciated and trusted betrayed him.

Perhaps this could have been the real process by which he became the mad monarch.

The battle was really fierce.

But he couldn’t see Elton, that should have attacked them from behind the village.

‘What is it?’

When Simon was frowning.

PUuuuuu!

The sound of a horn trumpet was heard.

At the same time, a troop with it’s flag risen appeared.

“What is it! What troop is it!”

At Simon’s yell, some soldiers went to check and then yelled with all their strength.

“It’s baron Mito Posis!”

At that moment, Simon’s face contorted in a nice to see way.

“He dares!”

The ones that were working for the 2nd prince Tommy had gathered in one place.

Simon clenched his fists.

“Fine! It rather turned out well! I will cut off your heads in one go!”

A voice filled with rage.

But his yell changed to that of a silence the more time passed.

“Mmm.”

In the first place, he couldn’t even face them through numbers.

Because he couldn’t see ELton, that had promised to attack them from behind.

On top of that, the position of the camp was also bad.

Simon’s and Lancephil’s troop was suffering attacks from the front and back.

“Damn!”

Simon cursed out at the disadvantageous situation.

‘You dare attack a prince of the kingdom? This is rebellion! Rebellion!’

Attacking nobles that worked with his brothers was completely different to them attacking him.

Subjugation and rebellion.

It was completely different.

‘If I just overcome this situation you and Tommy will also suffer the consequences!’

But he couldn’t know.

That now that the situation climbed up to this, Luke and Mito knew that they would lose their lives however the situation turned out.

There was only one situation in which they could keep their lives.

And that was Simon’s death.

So because of that, they could only act while taking the heavily load called rebellion.

“Attack! Attack! Push them back!”

Simon continued to lay rough orders.

Then.

Sweeeeeee!

A sharp sound was heard.

Followed by.

Puk!

One arrow pierced the head of the soldier that was next to Simon.

“Do, dodge!”

Io covered Simon’s shoulders with a surprised expression.

“Thi…. thi…….. this trash like bastards……..!”

Simon’s body trembled.

A yell he couldn’t hear at all until now was heard.

“Kill Simon!”

“Kill the prince!”

The situation was flowing to a completely unexpected pace.

Chapter 102




Edit (CSV): “New Medicine” and “palace” have been corrected to “God’s Medicine” and “the Holy Emperor”.

Edit: the description of “dirty mana” of Simon’s Mana Technique has been updated to “dirty evil mana”.

Simon was a brave general so to speak.

He worked really hard to garner the love and interest of the king, King Deni III, and the result of that was that he gained unbelievable swords skills.

But the problem was his hot temperament and excessive ambition.

On top of that, his obsession with people was also severe because of the sense of loss he felt while growing up.

If the person didn’t react to his trust and love, he became greatly enraged. To say nothing of betrayal and rebellion.

If he got angry once, he didn’t care for anything else.

It was to the point that you couldn’t even expect a proper decision.

If his grandfather wasn’t Duke Bradley Webster, then he would already have been disqualified from the competition for the throne.

But even that Bradley was beheaded by Simon someday.

Simon already showed signs of becoming a mad monarch since he was small.

Of course, there was something else that affected his temperament, but the only ones that knew of this truth were Bradley, Simon, and his vassals.

“Prince. It is difficult like this.”

Ralph Tains, who was leading his troop and pushing back Luke Aip’s army, returned with a defeated look.

Simon trembled.

“Elton, why isn’t Elton Coat coming?”

“He’s only waiting at the rear of the northern village. He’s not showing any movements.”

Ralph bowed with a pitiful expression.

At that moment, Simon’s face contorted in a scary way.

‘Elton! You dare………’

His teeth were grounded automatically.

Elton not moving until now meant that he had betrayed him or from the start, wasn’t his vassal.

‘I don’t know about others, but for you to betray me!’

Elton had quite the wide territory even among barons and on top of that had outstanding abilities.

Because of that, he was someone he had raised with great care for the competition.

And actually after bringing him over, he had overcome several dangerous situations because of him.

On top of that.

‘He’s a distant relative of my grandfather.’

Although it was a collateral relation by blood, he was certainly someone that received the lineage of the Webster dukedom.

As he was a relative of Simon’s mother, he could trust in him more than anyone.

But that Elton Coat had betrayed him.

‘I didn’t even know that and told him to grasp the movements of the nobles on our side……’

He thought that he discovered Luke Aip and Mito Posis being spies because of that.

He had been tricked quite well this time.

“Trash-like bastard.”

Curses came out with a cold voice.

Simon glared at the battlefield, eyes filled with rage.

The battle flowed with more urgency at every moment.

“Catch the prince!”

“I will give an amazing reward to the one that catches the prince!”

The rebel army kept charging to the center of the troop thinking that everything would end when they caught Simon.

Although Lancephil’s troop and Simon’s army had a solid formation and went to defend, the difference in numbers was too great.

It was obvious that in this situation the entire line was going to fall.

“Prince! We have to take cover for now!”

Io yelled with an urgent expression.

And Ralph also did the same.

However Simon clenched his fists and didn’t move.

‘You dare to betray me?’

The trembling became bigger.

In that instant, his eyes that were filled with rage started to shine.

At the same time, his eyes that were almost brown turned black.

‘Damn!’

Ralph, who was looking at the side, had a surprised expression on his face.

‘He’s going to explode once again!’

He made a handsign to the back hurriedly.

One of the strongest forces of Simon, the Leo knights, came running.

They put Simon in the middle and skillfully took positions.

They were holding a rope that was made with Ogre tendons in both of their hands.

Io, who was looking at the situation, just had a confused expression on his face.

‘Just what is this…….?’

Then Ralph walked carefully and grabbed Simon’s arm.

“Prince. You can’t get shaken here. Please, get a hold of yourself.”

It was an earnest voice.

“There are even more people believing and following you. So please…..”

Ralph bowed with an expression as if he was about to cry.

Then.

Slap!

A loud sound was heard.

Simon suddenly slapped his own cheek.

His lip burst and his cheek turned red.

“Prince!”

Ralph and Io approached him while they were surprised.

Simon smiled bitterly and shook his hands.

“I’m fine.”

His voice was lowered and sounded more calm..

Ralph hurriedly looked into Simon’s eyes.

The blackened eyes returned to their original color.

‘Done!’

He cheered up and made a gesture with his chin towards the knights.

The knights that were looking at Simon with a nervous expression hurriedly returned to their own positions.

“Ralph.”

“Yes Prince.”

“I could calm myself down thanks to you.”

“That’s not true.”

Ralph bowed.

Simon smiled bitterly and looked at the battlefield.

“Die!”

“Pierce through!”

The yells of the rebel army hit his ears.

The front line was getting pushed back little by little.

Simon took in a deep breath.

‘We have to take cover for now.’

The situation had already inclined towards the other side.

If he became stubborn here and was captured or died, all the merits that he had accumulated until now would become foam.

‘If I die here, Tommy and Kallum will step up to decorate this battle as a fair one.’

That was something that was absolutely unforgivable.

‘This is my fault, whatever they say.’

He should have listened to Roan.

It was his fault for having trusting Elton too much.

Also.

‘Nowadays, it’s becoming harder to control my rage.’

He clearly felt the changes in his body and heart.

‘The stronger my body becomes, the weaker my heart becomes.’

Simon bit his lower lip.

‘It’s useless regretting it now. They are all things I chose.’

It is true that he lacked self control and was hot tempered.

But the reason his temperament took a turn for the worse was because of the mana technique and sword technique Bradley Webster got for him.

They were a sword and mana technique that you couldn’t even name.

‘If my mana level increases more than this then it would become troublesome.’

If that happened, then there was a big possibility for him to lose all of his rationality.

‘Since grandfather has asked for the God’s medicine from the Holy Emperor, so I just have to endure for a little bit more.’

If he could just get his hands on the God’s Medicine, he would be able to cleanse all of the dirty evil mana and show an overwhelming power.

‘I just have to trust in my grandfather for that. First, I……’

Simon’s eyes moved to Io.

‘I have to get out of here.’

His brown eyes settled down calmly.

“Count Lancephil. If it’s true that Elton has betrayed me, this won’t be everything. Then, getting out of here will be quite difficult. But…….”

He bowed towards Io.

“I really have no face towards Count Lancephil, but I still can’t die.”

“Pr, prince.”

Io became surprised.

Simon raised his head and looked at Io’s eyes fixedly.

“Is there a method to get out of here, for me to live?”

It was a look he couldn’t understand at all.

Until just now, it was Simon that was caught up in his rage.

But soon he had found his composure back.

‘Can a normal person be like this?’

Even Io was astounded.

On top of that, the actions of Ralph and the Leo knights were quite suspicious.

But anyways, the prince had bowed and asked him for a favor.

He couldn’t just ignore and decline him.

Io took a deep breath.

“We are going to make a rearguard composed by my troop and your army and defend you. On top of that, we are going to hit the sides of the enemy with the strongest force, the Leo knights, and buy some time. Prince, you just go to Trem Village with Baron Tains.”

“To Trem village……?”

Simon asked back with a confused expression on his face.

Io replied back with a voice filled with confidence.

“If it’s the Amaranth troop, they would have certainly noticed this. Roan will certainly come. He will come and rescue us. Just endure until then.”

“The words of Count Lancephil are true, prince.”

Even Ralph butted in, so Simon nodded.

“I understand. I will do as Count Lancephil says.”

Right after he said that, Ralph raised his blade high into the air.

“We are retreating!”

“Sir!”

Sounds of answering to the order were heard everywhere.

Simon was about to say something to Io before he left but decided to shut his mouth.

‘I will tell him when I meet him later.’

He was planning to bow his head and apologize for today’s mistake.

The knights and soldiers that were scattered around started to take formation.

And the one that departed first was certainly Simon.

Behind him, the troops of the Webster family and his own troops stuck close to him as if they were escorting him.

Then, Mito Posis, who was trying to pierce through the center, pointed at Simon and yelled.

“Huh? The prince is escaping! Chase!”

Luke also did the same.

“Chase!”

“He must catch the prince!”

It was an order close to despair.

Luke Aip and Mito Posis grew tense.

There was only one method where they could live.

And that was beheading Simon.

‘Bring his head and find the 2nd prince……’

And even if that wasn’t the case.

‘If I escape to Byron kingdom or Istel kingdom, I would certainly be treated really well.’

Anyways, this situation didn’t permit him to live normally.

They chased after Simon with a flushed face.

“Where?! I can’t send you off like this!”

Io pulled out his sword and yelled.

Following his order, the soldiers set up a defensive line.

Behind him, the Leo knights quickly swung their blades.

Cheng! Checheng! Cheng!

Just like that, a battle started between the ones being chased and the ones chasing them.

And the battle flowed really urgently.

*****

‘It’s difficult.’

Ralph’s eyes darkened.

He kept glancing back even while he was riding without stop.

The number of knights and soldiers following him clearly decreased.

The chase of Luke and Mito was really amazing.

Because they were also putting their lives on the line in this.

Thanks to that, only a minority of knights remained with Simon to escort him and the other soldiers and knights went to the rear to help Io.

‘The bigger problem……’

As they kept escaping to where the escape route was open, they were getting farther away from their destination that was Trem Village.

‘In this situation, we are going to get annihilated.’

But just because of that, they didn’t have any clear plans to overcome this.

They could only hope for anyone to appear and rescue them.

Then.

Sweeeeee!

A sharp sound was heard.

And a shadow covered them from above.

Pubububuk!

A rain of arrows poured over the surrounding of Simon and Ralph.

“It’s the infantry!”

“Dodge!”

Yells poured out from the surroundings.

“Kuk!”

The soldiers that couldn’t dodge, became porcupines and collapsed.

Hiiiing!

The horses cried loudly and raised their front legs.

Simon and Ralph looked at the hills at the sides and frowned.

They were looking at the troop flag that was over the hills.

That was certainly Luke’s troop flag.

But it was quite a small troop.

Even so, it was true that it was difficult for Simon and Ralph to face even that much.

Even if they faced them and pierced through, they would clash with Luke and Mito who were chasing them from the back.

‘I have to at least save the prince.’

Ralph grinded his teeth.

Then, Simon’s voice was heard.

“It seems it’s up to here.”

He pulled out his blade with a pathetic expression.

“Prince.”

Ralph grinded his teeth and bowed.

Simon didn’t mind and looked at the troop flag that appeared over the hill.

‘Even so, for the infantry to appear over here……. They prepared more thoroughly than I had thought.’

Actually, the troop that appeared on both of the hills were patrolling troops.

Belpis, who was leading his troop, was hurriedly returning to the northern village when they heard that the identities of Luke and Mito were exposed.

‘But to meet the prince here.’

It was simply a lucky situation.

A smile bloomed on Belpis’s mouth.

‘If we catch the prince, the road to flee appears.’

His heart beat quickly.

“Attack!”

He swung his blade widely and kicked his horse.

Ralph looked at Simon with a hardened expression.

They didn’t have anymore time to waste.

“Prince! We will block them here however we can! You just try to flee!”

“No, there’s not even room to flee.”

Simon gritted his teeth.

Belpis’s troop was quite the small one, but they were pouring down from the cliffs.

Simon didn’t see any routes to escape.

“Prince…..”

Ralph had a regrettable expression on his face.

Simon forced a smile and nodded.

The two people looked at each other and then slightly lowered their heads.

It was a look like they were making their last resolutions.

If things didn’t flow as he wanted, he was planning to throw away everything at the end and explode.

Belpis looked at Simon standing stupidly and yelled.

“Prince! Catch the prince! We don’t need the other bastards!”

Belpis’s troop charged towards Simon.

“You dare!”

Ralph yelled loudly and went to the front.

And the knights followed after him.

Dudududu!

The charging was stopped in an instant.

Then.

Sweeee!

A sound splitting the air was heard.

At the same time, arrows appeared from over the hill.

They were arrows flying while the air was being split.

The tip of the arrows shone.

Pubububuk!

The arrows hit the space between the two troops.

“Huh?”

“Wh, what is it?”

Belpis, who was charging, frowned and lowered his speed.

He was half astounded at the sudden rain of arrows.

‘Ma, maybe?’

Belpis’ eyes become wide.

Ralph, Simon, and the knights also had surprised expressions.

Their sights naturally moved towards the hills.

Then.

Puuuuuuu!

The sound of the horn trumpet rang through the battlefield.

At the same time, a troop flag appeared from over the hills.

Amaranth.

At that instant, a faint light appeared in Simon’s face and everyone else’s.

It was the saviors they were waiting for.

The only person that could rescue them.

Roan had appeared.

“Fortunately we aren’t late.”

Roan appeared from below the high flying troop flag.

‘It’s because the staff members of the agency kept raising beacons.’

The staff members that were spread in the entire region of Tale couldn’t fight themselves, but grasping Simon’s position was easy enough.

They notified Roan that Simon was retreating to the west through the beacons.

Thanks to that, Roan and Amaranth troop could turn the head of the horses towards the west and not the northern region of Tale, and charge.

Roan let out a short sigh and gave the order.

“Prepare to charge.”

The soldiers that were at the back raised the shields they had on their backs.

And at the same time, they moved their chests closer to the horses.

Roan’s eyes shone.

“We are piercing through the rebel army.”

“Sir!”

A short answer was given in response.

At the same time, an amazing vigor surged up.

“Charge!”

Right after Roan sent out the order, the horses started to charge.

And Roan was obviously at the front.

“S, stop them!”

Belpis became perplexed and pulled the reins.

The entire troop halted their charge and turned back to look at the Amaranth troop.

Their raised spears and swords trembled.

‘We, will we be ab, able to face the Amaranth troop?’

‘The strongest troop in the region of Tale……..’

The troop members of Belpis swallowed with an expression filled with despair.

They were also very familiar with Roan and the troop’s abilities, to the point that their ears were wearing out.

And they had also witnessed it several times.

Dudududu!

Horse clops were heard clearly.

And finally.

Bang!

Roan and the Amaranth troop clashed against Belpis’ troop.

The soldiers that had their shields raised bounced off the swordsmen and spearmen.

“Kuk!”

“Kugh.”

The spears broke and the swords bounced off.

The horses didn’t lower their running speed but rather ran even more fiercely.

Roan took out the Travias Spear in that while and started swinging it.

Slash!

A stream of blood splashed alongside a terrible noise.

In the first place, Belpis’ troop wasn’t an opponent for the Amaranth troop.

On top of that, they also had fewer numbers.

Pat!

Roan’s horse kicked the ground and jumped.

He had a look that was splitting the air while he was drawing a line.

It was a really powerful and wonderful look.

Tadak!

The horse jumped over the soldiers and landed softly.

There was no more enemies blocking his path.

Roan hurriedly dismounted the horse and saluted shortly.

“Prince. Are you hurt anywhere?”

Simon, who was looking at the battlefield, got a hold of himself late.

He nodded with a pitiful expression.

“I’m ashamed of myself, but yes, I’m safe.”

Roan listened to what he wanted to and then turned back after bowing shortly.

Meanwhile, the Amaranth troop safely broke through Belpis’ troops.

Roan reorganized the formation with a handsign and slowly moved his steps.

He grabbed the Travias Spear and then glared at Belpis.

He had a cold and scary look on his face.

Gulp.

Belpis unconsciously swallowed with his dry mouth.

Roan breathed in slowly and pointed at the bastard with the Travias Spear.

“From now on……”

The voice spoke calmly in a settled manner.

Strength was put into his hand, clutching the spear.

Simon, Ralph, and the knights all leaned their ears towards Roan’s voice.

At that moment, a faint smile appeared on Roan’s mouth.

“Amaranth troop is taking over this battlefield.”

Chapter 103




“Damn it! That old man really is a pain.”

“Anyways, it seems like we can finally see the end.”

Luke Aip and Mito Posis had fishy smiles on their faces.

Their gazes moved beyond the battlefield.

“Bastards! You will never pass over here!”

From between the two hills.

An old man with a big body was swinging his sword from the narrow passageway.

It was Io Lancephil who was leading the rearguard.

He blocked the rebel army well with just a small number of knights and soldiers.

But the number of soldiers that remained decreased to the point that he could count them with his eyes thanks to the prolonged battle.

‘Kugh! At least, we have to block this passage.’

If they just blocked here, he would be able to tie down Mito and Luke for a while.

“Leo knights to the front!”

At Io’s orders, the knights that were resting for a moment, stepped up.

Slash! Stab!

The sharp blades split the air and cut down the throats of the enemy soldiers.

It was a really amazing show of force.

But the numbers of the enemies were just too much.

“Kill!”

“Kill! We must catch the prince!”

New soldiers appeared over the fallen ones.

They swung their spears and blades with all of their strength.

Slash.

The knights that were exhausted couldn’t completely dodge the enemy attacks.

One spear stabbed the arm of a knight.

“Kugh! Son of a bitch!”

The knight cursed and moved.

He tried to fall back but the enemy soldiers stuck together like ants.

“Kugh!”

In the end, one knight finally lost his life.

“Kuk.”

Io saw that scene and ground his teeth.

The soldiers and knights were falling one by one.

The defensive line blocking the passage was getting sloppier at every moment.

Then, the voices of Mito and Luke were heard.

“Hahaha! Io Lancephil! It seems like you are also exhausted now!”

“It’s time to catch the old tiger!”

Cynical voices.

However Io didn’t react.

He just glared at them with cold and fierce eyes.

‘Ugh. What kind of eyes……’

‘A tiger is still a tiger even when old.’

Luke and Mito felt a chill and shrugged.

“Kill!”

“Kill them and chase after the prince!”

They yelled out at their feelings of embarrassment.

The two barons that flinched ran towards Io and the rearguard.

It was indeed a situation of life and death.

Then.

“Huh?”

“What is it?”

The enemy soldiers who were located at the front, frowned.

A feeling covering their entire bodies.

Their feet certainly trembled.

Dudududu!

Followed by that, a sound that shook the ground hit their ears.

It was to the point that now, they didn’t even have to tilt their ears.

Everyone’s sights moved behind the rearguard.

From between the two cliffs.

Dust surged up over the passageway.

‘It’s a troop!’

Io swallowed nervously.

He wasn’t certain about the identity of the troop running towards them.

Puuuuuuu! Puuuuuuuuuu!

Followed by that, the sound of the horn trumpet was heard.

At the same time, the troop flag that was at the front fluttered in the wind.

<Amaranth.>

It was Roan’s Amaranth troop, the ones they had nightmares about.

“Ah…..”

Io let out a low cry of exclamation.

His legs gave out.

And that was also the same for the other knights and soldiers.

The rearguard had touched expressions of their faces and moved to the sides.

Roan and the Amaranth troop appeared from the open passageway.

The Amaranth troop quickly took formation and sealed the passage.

Roan fell back and looked at Io.

“Sir count! Are you okay?”

“I am. I’m fine.”

Io smiled faintly and nodded.

Roan smiled as if he was glad.

“For now, we will catch the rebel army.”

“Their number isn’t that small.”

Io had a worried facial expression.

Because the Amaranth troop had only 300 soldiers when the rebel army composed of 4000.

Even when he combined the numbers of the surviving rearguard soldiers, they numbered only up to 1000.

“It’s fine.”

But even so, Roan was overflowing with confidence.

He pulled the reins and stood in front of the Amaranth troop.

“Luke Aip! Mito Posis!”

A loud voice shot out.

It was an overwhelming look even in front of 4,000 enemy soldiers.

“Oho! I was wondering who it was, but it was Roan!”

“The one who pretended to be a general when he is merely a commoner!”

Luke and Mito let out mocking statements.

Actually, they were seriously nervous at the Amaranth troop’s entrance.

But after they realized that their numbers were only 300, they becamr cocky again.

“Even if that wasn’t the case, I still wanted to cut your throat!”

Luke raised his right hand after yelling.

It was to lay down the order to charge.

Then, Roan raised the Travias Spear and looked at the enemy army.

“Listen, soldiers belonging to Aip’s and Posis’ army!”

He put strength into his voice with the Flamdor mana technique.

Thanks to that, the normal soldiers felt an overwhelming pressure the instant they heard the voice.

“Luke Aip and Mito Posis raised their blades against the 1st prince of the Rinse kingdom and the owner of the Regate Dagger!”

His mana boiled.

Heat made his voice hot.

“This is a clear rebellion and treason! You have now taken side with the rebels!”

Boom!

The faces of the soldiers of the rebel army became stiff.

It was true that they were chasing after Simon because of Luke’s and Mito’s orders.

Although there were some that were greedy to rise to a higher position or for goods among them, most of them moved because they didn’t have any other options.

“A, are were really from the rebel army?”

“I, I just did what I was ordered to?”

The soldiers started to get shaken up.

Roan didn’t miss this opportunity.

“The ones that participated in the rebellion will be beheaded and their families will become slaves!”

It was the decisive blow.

“Get our heads cut off? Die?”

“Slaves? Our father, mother will become slaves?”

“My son is only three but he will become a slave?”

Several voices could be heard from everywhere.

Luke and Mito realized that things were progressing in a weird way and yelled.

“Don’t be shaken! Our situation is much more favorable! Prince Simon is right in front of our noses!”

“If we can just catch the prince, we’ll be able to live well!”

The soldiers were shaken up once again.

“Right. We are already in this anyways.”

“Prince Simon won’t leave us alone.”

“Now that it has turned out like this, we must catch the prince.”

The atmosphere turned around again in a weird fashion.

But Roan still had a confident expression on his face.

He pulled out a dagger with fancy symbols from his waist.

“This is the symbol of the 1st prince of Rinse, the Regate Dagger! Prince Simon gave me this dagger to me and named me as the one responsible for the region of Tale! My orders are the orders of the prince, and my words are the words of the prince!”

Roan looked at the confused soldiers and said.

“The ones that surrender right now won’t be asked of their sins!”

It was an amazing decision.

“Is, is that true?”

“Are you really forgiving our lives?”

The normal soldiers asked with a nervous expression.

Roan pulled Regate dagger.

Cheng!

A clear sound of metal spread out.

“If I’m lying, I will give up my head!”

His eyes and voice were showing his solid resolution.

The rebel soldiers nervously swallowed their saliva.

They looked at each other faces and started to tremble.

‘We are just normal soldiers.’

‘We just want to eat three meals a day and live happily with our families.’

‘I can’t mess with the lives of my family.’

The soldiers were commoners you could see everywhere.

But they were afraid of Luke and Mito and couldn’t move as they wished.

They were still confused and couldn’t bring out the courage.

Then.

Puuuuuuu!

A troop appeared from the plains of the west with the sound of the horn trumpet.

They were members of the Amaranth troop that returned to their HQ in Mediasis Village to ride on horses and go to battle again.

Their number was close to 1,000.

The rebel army had 4,000, and the Amaranth troop combined with the rearguard were 2,000.

The number of soldiers that had an overwhelming difference was now closed by quite a lot.

‘They came.’

Roan saw at the friendly troop that appeared and smiled.

He yelled with a calm and composed voice.

“Are you going to die as rebels! Or suppress the rebels and become heroes?!”

His voice was filled with strength and rang through the battlefield.

The rebel soldiers that were confused when they saw the new troop appear, became resolute.

If it was this much of a difference, they couldn’t conclude a victory against the Amaranth troop.

They couldn’t throw away the lives of their families and their own lives in a fight that wasn’t certain.

They weren’t people like Luke or Mito who had huge ambitions.

“I, I will surrender!”

“I will also surrender!”

The normal soldiers came running towards the Amaranth troop while their arms were raised.

That was the start.

“We just did as we were ordered to!”

“Save us!”

“We didn’t have any other intentions!”

Several soldiers raised their arms in surrender and moved out of their ranks.

‘Okay!’

Roan cheered up at that sight.

His game changer had worked.

Roan had three reasons in why he gave the opportunity to surrender.

The first.

‘If we battle like this, a lot of people will get injured.’

The second.

‘Most of them just moved while following orders.’

The soldiers couldn’t refuse an order by a noble and moved.

The third.

‘I have to absorb these soldiers to become mine.’

The current Amaranth troop had barely 2,000 soldiers.

Although they had clearly increased compared to before, thinking about the future, it was a really regrettable level.

If they were soldiers that already faced several battles, they would be able to become strong and excellent soldiers with just a little bit of training.

On top of that.

‘If I can just migrate the families of the soldiers……..’

He would be able to secure quite the number of residents in an instant.

With these reasons, Roan tried to make them surrender, and it succeeded really well.

“Stop!”

“I will slice the throats of those who surrender!”

Luke and Mito were greatly agitated and were trying to stop the soldiers trying to leave their ranks.

Thanks to that, the two people that were at the back of the troop ended up coming to the front.

Roan, who was calmly checking on the situation, didn’t miss this opportunity.

“Harrison.”

Harrison quickly knocked an arrow at the voice that called to him in a low tone.

He was also waiting for Luke and Mito to enter into his range.

Sweeeeee!

A sharp sound.

“Everyone hold your places! Don’t be deceived at that cunning ton……..Kuk!”

The arrow precisely pierced Mito’s forehead.

“Hup!”

Luke gasped at the sudden situation.

Mito started to fall down while his eyes opened up wide from the situation.

Boom!

He rolled on the ground with a heavy sound.

“Damn!”

Luke quickly got down from his horse and hid his body.

“Si, sir baron!”

“Baron Posis!”

The soldiers belonging to Posis saw the deceased Mito and yelled.

“It’s the last chance! Is there no one else that will surrender!”

His voice filled with mana, rang through the battlefield.

The last note.

It was at this moment.

The confused soldiers started to leave their ranks just like they were water.

“No! No! You stupid bastards!”

Luke yelled but he couldn’t stop the soldiers.

In the end, the only ones that remained with him were the commanders and adjutants; they only amounted to a hundred.

“Thi, this…….A commoner bastard dares……!”

Luke couldn’t hold down his rage.

Everything had ended anyways.

“At the very least, I will kill you!”

He attacked Roan.

It was a really ignorant and reckless attack.

Roan spun his spear once and rode on his horse.

“You…..”

A cold voice flowed.

“…aren’t my opponent.”

Right after he said that, the Travias Spear drew a line of light and moved.

Stab!

The spear moved strangely and stabbed his body after fending off his blade.

“Kuhok.”

Luke yelled and collapsed like that.

“The, the road to, to escape was in front of me…….. Grr.”

He couldn’t finish his last words.

Luke ended up dying like that.

“Sir baron!”

“Kugh! Baron Aip!”

The commanders and adjutants following him yelled aloud

Roan just looked at that silently and then shook his right hand.

It was a signal that meant charge.

The Amaranth troop moved silently and quickly.

The remaining rebel soldiers couldn’t become their opponents at all.

They left success that was in front of their eyes and failed.

And the ones that had stopped them was none other than Roan.

*****

The Poskein Exodus had ended.

On top of that, the spies that tried to kill Simon were also captured.

But Elton and the spy planted by the 3rd prince Kallum didn’t miss the opportunity and escaped to their own territories when they got the chance.

Simon didn’t order to chase them.

As monsters didn’t appear anymore from the lake, it was just like the subjugation had ended.

Everyone cheered up and were happy but Roan wasn’t like that.

One corner of his heart sunk deeply.

327 deceased soldiers.

He had expected that it wasn’t going to be an easy subjugation.

But even so, his losses were too big.

He remembered Troop Commander Gale, Mendel, Keniss, and etc. Gave up their lives to rescue Corps Commander Aaron.

But of course, every time Roan battled, he was improving himself.

In spear skills, mana technique, strategies, as a commander……

But he felt that everyone and every memory piled up in his heart.

“Troop commander.”

A familiar voice rang out.

As he moved his eyes, he saw Austin.

“The prince is looking for you.”

Maybe it was because of Roan’s sad expression that Austin spoke carefully.

“Austin.”

“Yes, commander.”

“Support the families of the deceased in an abundant manner and take care of their graves.”

Only then could Austin realize.

The reason why Roan was sad.

‘He’s a really good person.’

He felt that he was fortunate to be able to serve an excellent commander.

Austin nodded with a solemn expression.

“Certainly! I will do as you order.”

“Please.”

Roan patted Austin’s shoulders and moved.

A large shadow appeared following his back.

*****

The widest conference room in the HQ of the Amaranth troop.

The nobles were taking their places with Simon at the center.

There was some internal disturbance because of the spies like Luke, Mito, and Elton but just looking at the subjugation itself, it truly was an amazing success.

Especially when they heard that the 2nd and 3rd princes were having a hard time in their subjugations, the several nobles couldn’t hide their happiness.

Everyone was excited and they each started to boast about their merits.

Now, the merit awarding ceremony was going to start when they returned to the capital of Miller.

Even if you put aside the competition for the throne with Simon, who they were serving, it was obvious that they themselves were going to be rewarded.

Some nobles may obtain additional territories and some may climb ranks.

They would obviously feel happy.

Of course, this was excluding some nobles that raised their blades against Simon. Punishment would come first for them.

Simon was also planning to ask the sins of Tommy and Kallum.

‘But well, they will certainly act innocent.’

Simon thought of his two brothers and put on a smile.

Well, even if it was him, he would be planning in how to cut their tails.

But Simon still had a method.

‘From the two, I’m catching one first.’

Simon, Tommy, and Kallum.

The reason why the competition for the throne wasn’t easy was because the background of the three princes was similar.

Because of that, for one person to face two princes at the same time was close to impossible.

If they made a mistake, they would be the ones suffering the blow instead.

Because of that, Simon was planning to give up on someone and get rid of another one first.

‘Kukukug.’

Laughter kept coming out.

The moment Simon’s blade went to only one person.

The other person would have to choose.

To grab his hands or stand at the other side.

‘But of course, standing at the other side won’t be easy.’

Solid and scary plans were set up in his head.

Then.

“It’s Troop Commander Roan.”

One knight that was standing at the entrance notified everyone of Roan’s entrance.

At that moment, the noisy room became quiet in an instant.

The youth that had a confident attitude and was strong willed and also had a soft and prudent spirit.

The troop commander of the Amaranth troop and the one that had the commanding and strategizing rights for the region of Tale, Roan, had entered the conference room.

Everyone seated at this place knew.

That if it wasn’t for the youth in front of their eyes, they wouldn’t be able to cheer like this.

But some nobles were also swept up in another emotion.

Displeasure.

Although it was because they had neglected military discipline, Roan had executed a noble while he was merely a commoner.

They could only recognize his abilities but he was someone that made you feel bitter.

A person you wanted close, but instinctively made some distance with him.

That was who Roan was.

“Ahem.”

“Hmhm.”

Roan ignored the stifled sights and moved.

“I came by receiving your call.”

He stood in front of Simon and kneeled dowm.

“Right. I called you because I have something to tell you.”

He spoke in a soft voice.

Roan bowed.

“But before that…..”

He took out the dagger with fancy symbols from his waist and offered it with his two hands.

“The subjugation has ended. Troop Commander Roan of Amaranth, I will be returning the Regate Dagger to the prince just like I promised.”

“Right. You are returning it to me along with victory, just like you promised.”

Simon put a faint smile.

“Listen well!”

At that moment, Simon yelled in a loud voice and stood up.

At the sudden situation, the many nobles also stood up and bowed.

“This Poskein Lake subjugation has concluded in an excellent way. Now, I will be asking you. Who’s the one that raised the greatest merits?”

“……..”

At the sudden question, the nobles just looked at each other.

Their eyes were shaking.

Everyone knew the answer, but no one could easily open their mouths.

Then, Viscount Tio Ruin stepped up.

“It’s Roan, Troop Commander of Amaranth.”

At that moment, a faint smile appeared on Simon’s mouth.

He feigned ignorance and asked again.

“Who?”

“The one that raised the biggest merits is Troop Commander Roan.”

As Tio replied, Simon looked at the other nobles that were standing as if they were chicks that just ate honey.

“Do you think differently?”

Right after he said that, Io stepped up.

“The answer Viscount Tio Ruin gave is correct. The person at the top of the rank of merits for this subjugation is Troop Commander Roan.”

Followed by Tio, Io also stepped up.

By now the nobles that recognized Roan’s abilities like Ralph, Rael, and etc. also added in.

“It’s Roan.”

“Troop Commander of Amaranth.”

The atmosphere flowed in a weird fashion.

The nobles that were displeased at Roan just had their mouths shut.

They couldn’t speak badly of Roan’s merits as they wished.

How could they when he saved Simon’s life?!

“I think it is Roan.”

In the end, Roan was at the top of the ranking for merits.

Simon put on a smile and pulled out the dagger from his waist.

Srung!

The sound of metal rang out pleasantly.

“I, Simon Rinse, the 1st prince of the Rinse Kingdom and the owner of the Regate Dagger, invest Roan with the title of nobility of a baron instead of his majesty.”

“……..!”

While everyone was surprised, Simon touched Roan’s head and shoulders with the side of his dagger and then put it back.

Until that moment, the room was filled with silence.

Also for Roan.

Of course, the Rinse Kingdom had more cases compared to the other kingdoms where commoners became nobles.

If you raised big enough merits several times and had the help of someone, you could become a noble.

But taking into account that Roan was a sinner until recently, they thought that even if he was given a title, it would be a baronet.

The difference between a baronet and a baron was like the sky and the earth.

A baronet was a rank that was impossible to inherit.

But it was different for the baron.

If you just had a territory, you could say that you were a genuine noble.

Roan felt moved in a deep part of his heart.

He remembered the looks of his allies that left his side as they died in the battlefield.

But the merit rewards still didn’t end.

“Also, I won’t retrieve the Regate Dagger.”

Boom!

Everyone had surprised expressions on their faces once again.

The Regate Dagger was no different from the symbol of the 1st prince.

Giving it with the condition of returning it after the subjugation ended and not taking it back at all had completely different meanings.

And this was.

‘Roan is my person.’

Similar to that.

For Roan, who just became a noble, it was the biggest strength.

But of course because he was labeled as someone of the 1st prince, he was becoming enemies with the 2nd and 3rd princes. But there were more good points than bad ones.

Regardless of the surprise of the nobles, Simon had a really comfortable expression on his face.

He touched his chin and said nonsense words.

“The unfortunate word is that I don’t have any territory to give with the title of baron…… His merits are too precious to just give him the title and not a territory.”

“Hahaha!”

At that moment, a boisterous laughter came out.

Simon and the other nobles moved their heads to find the owner of the voice.

“Count Lancephil. Why are you laughing like that?”

Simon tilted his head.

The owner of the voice was none other than Io.

Io smiled brightly and pointed at the map that was spread on the table.

“I want to give the southern part of Lancephil’s territory with the region of Tale included to Baron Roan.”

It wasn’t surprising anymore.

It was like approaching the climax.

It was rumored that the territory of Lancephil was spacious.

But just because of that, it didn’t mean that it lost worth.

The nobles were also like this, but the most surprised person was Roan himself.

‘The Regate Dagger, the title of baron, and on top of that a territory? Just what……’

A lot of things were happening in an instant.

He did think that he would become a noble some day.

To be a monarch, to be a great commander, it was something he would automatically gain when he worked hard.

But he didn’t expect that this sudden situation would happen.

“Hahaha! Is that fine?”

“Yes. Roan is also a benefactor in my life. I also want to…….”

Io thought of the battle a few days ago and a faint light appeared in his eyes.

That light was as dense and deep as the eyes of a father.

“Pay him back.”

His voice rang in the air.

And also rang in Roan’s heart.

‘Count Lancephil.’

He felt stunned.

Then, a hand appeared in front of his eyes.

As he raised his head, he saw Simon smiling.

“Let’s go to the royal palace with me and have an audience with his majesty. Roan……”

A soft voice.

The smile on his face became denser.

“Baron Roan Tale.”

Chapter 104




Swoosh. Swoosh. Swoosh.

A sound that was nice to hear rang through the entire building.

Biggs, who was known to have the best abilities even among blacksmiths, was cleaning a piece of gold the size of a palm.

And in his surroundings, the other blacksmiths, alchemists, and etc. were gathered.

No, on top of that, Roan and the centurions of the Amaranth troop were also gathered up.

Biggs raised up the piece of gold that had a circular and flat shape to it and put on a bright smile.

He had a satisfied expression on his face..

“Troop Commander. Ah, no. Baron of Tale. It’s finished.”

Biggs gave him the piece of gold with a humble posture.

And Roan carefully took it.

On the flat piece of gold there was the symbol of the Amaranth troop with one leaf and two spears and also one beautiful shield.

You could see a short sentence following the borders of the gold piece.

Let our path be accompanied by the light of glory.

Roan looked at the piece of gold with a moved expression.

At that look, Biggs asked with a careful voice.

“Do you like it?”

Only then did Roan turn to look at Biggs and the several other people.

A bright smile appeared on his face.

“I like it. I really do like it. Thanks everyone.”

“Ah…..”

Sighs of relief could be heard everywhere.

Roan raised the piece of gold high into the sky and continued to say.

“The symbol and sentence you made will be used as the crest for the region of Tale.”

“Ah…..”

At that moment, everyone let out cries of exclamation with moved facial expressions.

Biggs bowed his head representing everyone.

“To use a coarse and lacking symbol as the crest of the territory…… We are really grateful. Truly, truly, thank you.”

Several people nodded and agreed.

The piece of gold that had a symbol and letters on it.

That was the gift that the blacksmiths, alchemists, and artisans prepared for Roan who became a noble.

They gathered their strengths to repay the grace they had received from Roan until now.

The symbol was devised by the artisans and the sentence by alchemists.

And the crafting was done by Biggs and the blacksmiths.

And like that, a cool symbol, that was one of a kind in the world was created.

“I’m the one that should be grateful.”

At Roan’s words, Biggs shook his hands.

“Compared to sir Baron who has taken care of us and helped us, it’s only a small repayment. We are just glad that you like this symbol made with lacking abilities.”

At those words Roan put on a faint smile.

Because he could feel the feelings of Biggs and everyone else’s.

He looked at everyone once and slightly bowed.

“Let’s keep working hard from now on.”

At that moment, everyone had surprised expressions on their faces and bowed.

Roan wasn’t a commoner anymore.

He was a noble with the title of Baron.

But Roan had lived almost 40 years as a commoner in his past life.

It was impossible for his words and actions to change to become that of a noble’s.

Thanks to that, the members of the Amaranth troop and the residents of Tale didn’t feel any displeasure or rejection from Roan at all.

A noble that wasn’t like a noble.

But rather a noble that knew the feelings of the commoners and knew how to take care of them.

That was Roan.

“Sir Baron.”

Austin approached and slightly bowed.

He spoke as if he were whispering.

“The director of the agency, Chris, has arrived.”

At those words, Roan nodded without saying anything.

‘There are many things that I have to do before going to the capital of Miller.’

As he became a baron and also obtained territory, there was a need to migrate all of the organizations that were scattered around everywhere.

In addition, it was time to slowly start the businesses and plans he couldn’t proceed with as he had wished.

Roan said his goodbye to the blacksmiths, artisans, and alchemists and walked away.

And the centurions followed behind him.

It was a majestic look.

‘We are now people of the region of Tale.’

‘We will become the main shaft of the region’s army.’

As Roan became a noble, the prestige and location of the members of the Amaranth troop became much higher than before.

Their steps became light.

At every step they took, strength followed back.

*****

Bang!

Kali Owells, the commander of the knights of the Lancephil family, couldn’t hold it in anymore and smacked the table.

“Damn it! Does this make sense?”

Curses surged up.

The men that were seated on the opposite side of Kali also shook their heads with a serious face.

They were the head of the mages, Tairon Bess, and the captain of the fief regiment Perry Wilson. 1

Tairon clicked his tongue.

“Tch. I didn’t know Count Lancephil was going to do this.”

Perry followed back.

“To give a part of the territory to that young and lowly bastard. It’s really a dumbfounding thing.”

As the two people added on, Kalis’ rage became fiercer.

“Damn it! I put my life into the war against Istel kingdom and also in this subjugation! This crazy old…….”

He forcefully swallowed the last words to follow.

He couldn’t say that Count Io Lancephil was a crazy old bastard.

But he couldn’t do anything about his boiling feelings.

‘Damn. If the Count retired or died, I wanted to share and eat up all of his territory!’

He had already finished speaking with Tairon and Perry.

Io was also very well aware that his territory would be floating alone if he died without leaving any successors.

In the end, it was obvious that he would be giving a title of nobility to the vassals that he could trust.

And Kali was aiming for that.

‘I even started a relationship with Duke Webster…….’

He was sending several offerings to Duke Bradley Webster in case other nobles aimed for the territory.

And thanks to that, he had received a bit of a pledge.

His plan was proceeding calmly like that.

But suddenly, Io took away a piece of his territory and gave it to Roan.

‘Actually, the territory he gave away wasn’t that wide and isn’t fertile ground…….’

Because he gave away a territory with the Tale region as the center, the ground itself wasn’t that charming of a place.

But the reason that Kali and the other two were quite angry.

‘He even gave away a peice of his territory with a light heart, but if he wants to name a successor for when he retires……’

Looking at the situation, it was obvious that Roan would become that successor.

At a slip up, the entire Lancephil territory would be given to Roan.

Kali, who was worried about that, was angry and displeased.

‘I didn’t like him from the start.’

When he first met Roan, he was a mere adjutant of a troop.

But even so, he received the interest of Io and Aaron and also the best spearman in the kingdom, Reil Baker.

‘On top of that he’s even been designated as the guardian for Prince Simon.’

It was a situation that couldn’t happen.

‘Thanks to that, it has become even more difficult to lay a hand on him.’

But even so, he couldn’t just continue watching.

And he couldn’t let the Lancephil territory be taken away any less.

‘I have to think of something.’

Kali gritted his teeth.

His two eyes started to shine.

But that wasn’t a good light.

It was chilly and creepy and also it showed a pair of nasty and disgusting eyes.

*****

“Let’s move the main office of the agency to Mediasis Village just like we debated and focus on increasing the number of residents earnestly.”

At Roan’s words, Chris and several other people nodded.

“The blacksmith, artisan, alchemist, and etc. are to make guilds and establish a headquarters and focus on gathering people.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Followed by that, a short answer was heard.

Followed by that, stuff related to the establishment of a port, organization of the roads, reforming the beacon system, establishment of villages, and etc. kept coming out.

They had sufficient funds because of the mining of magic stones.

For now, Roan was planning to set the base of the region of Tale solidly.

And thanks to that, there were more things that he had to do than he had thought.

“About the academy, I myself will find someone in the capital of Miller, so keep that into account.”

“Yes. We will focus on increasing the training grounds and establishing a system.”

“Good. I will entrust Glenn to the things related to the training field.”

“Yes. I will notify him like that.”

Roughless conversations were heard.

Then, Chris, who was taking notes about everything thoroughly, wrinkled his nose.

“What will you do about the five merchants we are providing with investments?”

Actually, Lidia of the carpenter business, Eska of the cooking business, Tio of the transportation business, Nego of the money lending business, and Ford of the mining business just received Roan’s investment, they weren’t a force Roan controlled just like the Amaranth troop or the agency.

But of course among them, Ford of the mining business was directly administered by Chris, so they had a relationship where they couldn’t split apart.

“First, think if they have any thoughts in moving their head offices to the region of Tale. In the case of Mr. Ford, ask him if he is able to accept running his business with the name of the territory.”

At those words, Chris asked with a careful voice.

“What if they deny?”

“Then there are no more investments?”

A simple answer.

The profits Roan gained while investing in the 5 merchants were quite a sum.

But that was when Roan roamed around without having a base.

Now, it was time to raise a force himself with the name of his territory.

“I understand.”

Chris didn’t ask anymore.

Because he also thought the same as Roan.

Then, Roan crossed his arms and said.

“When you go to talk to the five merchants, ask them about our future.”

“Our………future?”

Chris tilted his head.

Roan smiled faintly and continued speaking.

“Whether they want to do business on the entire continent and not only in the Rinse kingdom.”

“The, the entire continent?”

Chris asked back with a surprised expression.

And of all the other people did the same.

The centurions opened their eyes wide and looked at Roan.

Roan smirked and shrugged his shoulders.

“Why are you like this? Isn’t it obvious?”

He leaned his body forward and rested his hands on the table.

“We are facing all the kingdoms, not only Rinse Kingdom.”

Roan looked at everyone’s eyes fixedly.

“We are going to spread our name through the entire continent.”

Gulp.

Everyone swallowed with their dry mouths.

Semi asked with a trembling voice.

“Will, will that be possible?”

At those words, Roan smiled brightly and nodded.

“Even until now, a sinner that was exiled became a baron of the kingdom.”

He was talking about himself, Roan.

“There’s nothing impossible in this world.”

He took out the crest that he had received as a gift.

Let our path be accompanied by the light of glory.

Their sights were fixed on the short sentence.

Roan spoke with a confident voice and clear and deep eyes.

“Our path will be filled by the light of glory.”

*****

The capital of Miller was noisy.

Because news was continuously told while they were subjugating the monsters in Poskein Lake.

Simon Rinse, the 1st prince. Complete victory in the subjugation!

There are almost no damages to the southern region of the lake!

1st prince, complete victory!

Tommy Rinse, the 2nd prince. Struggled desperately in the subjugation!

Kallum Rinse, the 3rd prince. Barely held on!

2nd and 3rd princes. Lacking in skills?

Prince Tommy Rinse and Prince Kallum Rinse hold hands!

2nd and 3rd princes. Were they careless? They suffered great damages at the end!

The residents of the capital of Miller, that were among the wealthiest and most intelligent side of the kingdom, kept talking about the subjugation of the three princes when at least two of the citizens gathered.

“The 2nd and 3rd princes returned two days ago, right?”

“Yeah. It seems like they returned stealthily without even announcing their arrival.”

“They say they looked completely defeated.”

An amazing crowd was gathered on a long road to the castle of Miller that extended to the south.

They were all gathering for a small bouquet or a sky blue cloth.

“I even heard that the two of them gathered their strength together and lead the subjugation well…….Just what happened?”

“They say that the monsters coming out of the lake decreased and suddenly multiples of monsters poured out.”

“Aha! They were careless because they thought it was ending and suffered back.”

“That’s right! Because of that, they say that the western region of the lake became a complete wasteland.”

Mumbling sounds were heard.

Everyone heard similar stories.

Then, a youth that had thin eyes butted in.

The youth looked handsome and noble leaned his ear towards the conservation of the two people.

“They say that Prince Simon achieved a perfect victory compared to the other two princes?”

“Right. It seems like he didn’t get careless until the end and finished the subjugation perfectly.”

“Is it only that? I heard that some bad nobles rebelled and he cooly suppressed them.”

“Is a first born son really the first born?”

“Look at this. Looking that they announced that they were returning today, it seems like even the size of his plate is different!”

The people were now busy talking about Simon.

Then, the thin eyed youth that was just listening silently spoke in a really low voice.

“Um but.. as I heard, the one that lead them to victory was Troop Commander Roan who had the greatest merits……”

These were words he said as if they should start talking about it themselves.

Not differently, the surrounding people clapped and felt joy.

“Right! That’s right! What was it? Amass? Aranth?”

“Ei! Amaranth. Troop Commander Roan of the Amaranth troop led the subjugation to victory while holding the commanding and strategic rights.”

“That’s right! Amaranth! On top of that, he even captured the nobles that rebelled and saved the life of the prince?”

“Do you know what’s surprising? It’s that Troop Commander Roan is a commoner. A commoner.”

“Ohhhhhh!”

Cries of exclamations could be heard everywhere.

It seemed like they hadn’t heard yet about Roan receiving a title of nobility.

“Actually looking at it in another way, the hero of this subjugation is Troop Commander Roan.”

“Right. In the first place, they say that the region of Tale that the troop commander was defending, didn’t suffer any damages.”

“Kuha! The performance of a commoner troop commander! How cool! Really cool!”

The people became even more heated up about the stories of Roan.

They felt great satisfaction when they knew that the hero of this subjugation was a commoner just like them.

Then, the thin eyed youth threw a topic once again.

“As I heard it, Troop Commander Roan has a huge body and amazing strength…… Is that true?”

And the people were baited from everywhere.

“I heard that he was rather pretty and frail.”

“What are you talking about?! They said he was an amazing giant that made war horses look like ponies.”

“Right. Logically thinking, for a commoner troop commander to raise that amazing merit, wouldn’t he need an amazing strength?”

“Right. He has to be able to crush a rock with one hand.”

It seemed like they still didn’t know how Roan looked.

The thin eyed youth tried to bring out a topic again.

“Then, they say that he treats his underlings like his family and the residents as…..”

But he couldn’t finish this one.

An amazing cheer exploded from the side of the gate.

The people that were conversing noisily shut their mouths and turned their heads towards the side with the gate.

‘Hmm. I was curious if he was a commander that treated everyone like his family, without any discrimination……..’

The thin eyed youth smacked his lips as if it was regrettable.

But he also turned his head towards the gates.

‘I can only see and judge it for myself.’

A faint smile appeared on his face.

‘If he’s someone capable for me, Clay, to serve………’

His eyes started to shine.

Den.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

The sounds of the bell announcing Simon’s entrance were heard from the northern gate.

“Waaaaaa!”

The cheers of the people became noisier.

The Regate Dagger, that represented Simon, entered the open gate while it was fluttering.

Followed by that, Simon, Io, Tio, Ralph, and etc. showed up riding cool horses.

“Hahahah!”

Simon waved his hand towards the citizens shaking the flowers and sky blue cloths.

It was the look of a perfectly triumphant general.

Confidence emanated from his entire body as if it was water.

And Io, Tio, Ralph, and etc. also felt the same.

They waved their hands with a really proud and satisfied expressions on their faces.

And right behind them.

There was a youth that was forcing a composed expression while he was wearing normal armor.

On the left side of the armor, that was worn-out but clean, there was a crest that had a flower, two spears, and one shield drawn in it.

The short sentence written in it.

Let our path be accompanied by the light of glory.

The youth answered the cheers with a composed expression, different from the others.

He was the one being treated as a hero in this subjugation, Roan, no he was Baron Roan Tale.

The luxurious scene of the capital of Miller entered into his eyes.

At the end of the long road, he could see the high palace.

Roan gripped his reins tightly.

‘From now on……’

His chest heaved up.

‘It’s the real start.’

Chapter 105




Roan was half astounded.

He had lived for 40 years including his past life, but this kind of huge and luxurious place was a first.

‘Is this the royal palace?’

There were jewels with luxurious colors engraved in the high ceiling, and the wide floor was covered in high quality marble.

There were beautiful symbols following the walls, and several portraits hanging on them.

“Are you surprised?”

Io grabbed his shoulders and smiled.

Roan smiled in embarrassment and nodded.

Io, who saw that, pointed at the other end.

“This is merely the front room. The real palace is beyond that door.”

“Ah……”

Roan let out a low cry of exclamation.

‘How would the real palace look?’

He couldn’t even guess how it was.

“Roan. Now, we will soon be meeting his majesty……”

When Io spoke up to that point.

The east door of the room opened up.

At the same time, youths that looked similar but had different auras, appeared.

They were the 2nd prince, Tommy Rinse, and the 3rd prince, Kallum Rinse.

They approached the center of the room while leading several nobles.

Their faces were filled with displeasure and annoyance.

On the other hand, the face of Simon looking at them had a faint smile on it.

‘Prince Simon……’

Roan slightly bowed and then let out a sigh.

Because the moment he saw Kallum and Tommy, he remembered the report the agency brought him before leaving Mediasis Village.

The west side of the lake was devastated.

It was a short declaration.

But even with just that, Roan could guess how the situation had flowed.

‘Prince Simon didn’t notify the other princes about the final exodus.’

Thanks to that, innocent citizens had lost their lives.

The western region of the kingdom became ruins.

‘I knew that he had incredible ambition……’

He hadn’t expected that he would ignore his citizens because of his ambition.

No, he thought that perhaps he may do so in a corner of his heart.

Even if Simon was fine now, he was someone who would one day become a mad monarch.

‘No one was following behind him.’

He was that cruel and frenzied.

A monarch that couldn’t lead even one citizen.

That was the mad monarch.

The only things that followed him were monsters and the undead.

‘At least, it was like that from what I know……’

There was a bitter taste in his mouth.

‘What do I have to do……..’

He decided to become a monarch by himself.

But to raise a country, the situation was still too lacking.

He still had to raise his strength for now.

In that process, he was wondering how to continue the relationship with Simon.

‘I tried to help him to not become the mad monarch…..’

He thought that it was plentily possible if he watched and helped him starting from now.

But with this case, he realized that there was another problem.

Simon wasn’t the ideal monarch he wanted.

‘How stifling.’

A sigh came out on its own.

Meanwhile, Tommy and Kallum arrived in front of Simon.

“I’m meeting the 1st prince.”

The two people slightly bowed.

They didn’t treat nor suck up to him because he was the eldest brother.

But rather they acted as if they weren’t related at all.

On the other hand, Simon shook his head with a nice laugh.

“Hahaha! The 1st prince……. I told you to just call me brother. Right, I feel good knowing that you’re all safe.”

His mouth was sweet but he was hiding a knife in his stomach. (Idiom)

Simon wasn’t planning to bring out the noble spies in front of the two brothers.

He didn’t have to use favorable cards as he wished.

‘I certainly have to tie up one of the two.’

A fishy smile appeared on his face.

Then.

Boom!

A huge door at the center of the room started to slowly open up accompanied by a heavy sound.

It was finally time to meet Deni Von Rinse, the king.

“Hahaha! Then, shall we enter together?”

Simon was completely relaxed.

He started to move ahead of Tommy and Kallum.

‘Damn.’

‘Acting all good.’

The faces of the two princes contorted.

The nobles that were behind the three princes also moved with stifled looks.

The faces of the ones following Simon were bright, and the faces of the others were a bit complicated.

Especially among them, there was also Count Jonathan Chase, who had enmity with Io Lancephil.

‘Damn. His life thread is a really long one.’

His blue eyes stabbed behind Io’s head.

On the other hand, Io didn’t even mind the ones like Jonathan.

His only interest was in Roan.

“You can’t be mannerless.”

“Yes. I will take that into account.”

Roan listened to Io’s words and nodded.

The nobles following Kallum and Tommy saw that and frowned.

‘Who’s that greenhorn?’

‘It’s the first time that I’ve seen that guy.’

‘That young bastard is meeting his majesty?’

They had received reports about Roan’s merits, but they didn’t know how he looked.

The only one that did know was Jonathan.

‘So that bastard is that Roan.’

The one that made Benjamin Doyle, who he was giving interest to get a grasp on the eastern region, fall on a downslide.

‘Now that I see it, what happened to the bastards that infiltrated below that young bastard?’

It had been quite a while since he sent bright and skilled underlings to the region of Tale.

He had received some short letters, but they weren’t of any help.

‘Tch. I will have to investigate.’

Jonathan frowned and clicked his tongue.

Boom!

As they entered the room, the open doors were closed shut.

“Ah……”

Roan let out a cry of exclamation.

And that wasn’t because the room was luxurious.

But rather, it was small and unshapely compared to the front room.

‘But I don’t know why I feel regality.’

There were no such things like luxurious jewels, golden goods, or symbols.

The room, that was just decorated with marble and wood, was simple and small.

But he felt an amazing pressure from that small look.

“This is the real palace.”

Io’s voice rang out.

Roan thought he knew the meaning of that statement.

It wasn’t that it was the best just because it was luxurious.

‘Being majestic doesn’t come out just because you decorate it.’

A palace was a palace.

A royal room was a royal room.

So he automatically had the thought that the royal family was the royal family.

It was the regality made from tens and hundreds of years.

At the sides of the room, there were chairs made from wood and leather placed there.

And in those places the counts, dukes, marquises, and other important nobles were seated.

In the center of the room, there was another chair placed that wasn’t luxurious, but as it was too large, it made you feel some pressure.

‘That’s the seat of the king.’

Roan swallowed with his dry mouth for nothing.

It was the first time being in the royal room, even while counting his two lives.

Then the grand chamberlain, Viscount Logan Dayle, hit the marble floor three times with a large staff.

“The sun of the kingdom, and the deputy of the god Krea, his majesty Deni III is coming. The loyal retainers of the kingdom, show your manners.”

Right after he finished speaking, all the nobles that were seated, stood up.

They bowed towards the king’s seat.

And soon, an old man appeared with a face that full of laughter.

He was the king of the kingdom and the father of Simon, Tommy and Kallum, Deni Von Rinse.

“Hohoho.”

A laugh that was pleasing to listen to, rang out.

It was the unique laughter of Deni III.

“Everyone, sit.”

A soft voice spoke out.

The nobles bowed once again and then carefully sat down.

Deni III looked at the three princes that were standing politely and spread out both of his arms.

“Oh! My proud children.”

He seemed to truly be glad.

“I heard that you finished the subjugation safely. And of course…..”

The last part of his words dimmed.

“The merits of each person are different. Hohoho.”

They were words he said as if it was nothing.

But the faces of Tommy and Kallum contorted.

On the other hand, there was a faint smile on Simon’s mouth.

“Grand Chamberlain.”

At Deni’s call, Logan slightly bowed.

The king leaned his body on the huge chair and shook his hand.

“Shall we hear the reports of the three princes?”

“Yes.”

Logan replied shortly and then raised up a huge paper scroll.

“I will be starting with the merits of the 1st prince, Simon.”

After that, Logan kept naming the countless battles without even breathing.

And the longer the report became, the more the nobles trembled.

“Ho! That’s more amazing than what we received.”

“It’s really overwhelming.”

“I knew that the abilities of the 1st prince were great, but to be this much…….”

The nobles were filled with joy and sorrow.

“It’s the end. Next is the report of the 2nd prince, Tommy Rinse.”

Meanwhile, Logan finished Tommy’s merit report and started with Kallum’s.

“Next is the report of the 3rd prince, Kallum Rinse.”

And followed by that, Kallum’s report was also told.

The two people had raised excellent merits.

But compared to Simon, they were lacking too much.

“Even when they held hands together, they can’t follow the merits of the 1st prince.”

“On top of that, the counterattack they suffered at the last moment was too much.”

“They say the western region became complete ruins.”

Voices filled with regret were heard everywhere.

And the more that happened, the darker Kallum’s and Tommy’s faces became.

Even when they heard, Simon’s merits were overwhelming.

‘There was this much of a difference?’

Their faces became red.

They were embarrassed, angry, and annoyed.

“With this, I will be finishing the merit reports.”

Logan let out a deep sigh and put down the scroll.

At that moment.

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Deni III suddenly started to clap.

The nobles looked at him with confused faces and followed his actions late.

Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

The sound of claps filled the entire room.

“Amazing. The three of you are amazing.”

Deni III continued to laugh.

“But of course, the best among you…..”

His eyes twisted in a strange way.

“Is Simon.”

A declaration.

It was the declaration of the king that you couldn’t lightly pass off.

Simon bowed.

“I just did my best.”

“No, it’s really amazing. Really amazing.”

Deni III loudly laughed and nodded.

And the nobles supporting Simon brightened up.

On the other hand, the nobles following Kallum and Tommy had their faces scrunched up.

Then.

“But anyways, you said that something not related to the subjugation occurred?”

Deni III asked with a gentle voice.

A smile appeared on Simon’s face, who was bowing.

‘He’s talking about the rebellion.’

He slightly glanced back and looked at Tommy and Kallum.

Their faces were completely contorted now.

‘That’s nice to see.’

Simon snorted and raised his head.

“A group of nobles have raised their blades towards me.”

“Right. I heard that they were Luke Aip and Mito Posis.”

At those words, Tommy slightly trembled.

‘There’s no one that knows that Luke and Mito are my spies.’

Tommy forced himself to calm down.

Then, Simon’s voice was heard.

“They didn’t have enough by raising their blades against a prince but they also did something really disgusting and nasty.”

“What was it?”

Deni III raised a brow and asked back.

Simon took out some letters from his chest and gave it to Deni III.

“Read it.”

At Simon’s words, Deni III took the letters and started to slowly read them.

The more he read, the more his face contorted.

Tommy, who was looking wondering what happened, became pale.

‘Th, that’s!’

The envelope for the letters was too familiar.

‘Those are things that I sent to Luke and Mito.’

They were letters saying that they should stay next to Simon and check up on him.

‘But just that is enough to prove that Luke and Mito were my spies.’

In any case, their rebellion would become something caused because of him.

His hands and feet became cold.

‘Ho, how is that in Simon’s hands…….’

His eyes rolled anxiously.

Meanwhile, Deni III read all of the letters and looked at Simon and Tommy.

“Are the contents of this letter true?”

Tommy couldn’t speak as he wished and just looked at Simon.

Deni III asked again with an angered voice.

“Is it true that Luke Aip and Mito Posis aimed for your throat after receiving Tommy’s instigation?!”

Boom!

It seemed like a huge wave fell on the room.

Everyone received a great shock.

And especially for Tommy, it was too big.

‘Instigation? What instigation? I have never sent something like…..’

When he thought up to that moment.

Simon smiled brightly and shook his head.

“No. That letter is a fake one made by Luke and Mito.”

“Fake?”

Deni III frowned and asked back.

Simon nodded and looked at Tommy.

“Luke and Mito tried to separate me from my brother with just those small letters. That’s a really disgusting and nasty thing to do.”

His cold eyes made Tommy’s eyes hurt.

Tommy just nervously swallowed with his dry mouth.

Deni III raised the letters and asked.

“Is that really true?”

It was a voice that was asking a question.

Simon nodded.

But he was still looking at Tommy.

“Of course. Would there be a reason for my brother, Tommy, to kill me? Isn’t that right Tommy?”

Again, it was another voice that was asking a question.

Tommy bit his lower lip.

‘Simon. You’re playing with me!’

But he couldn’t act as he wished here.

He forced a smile and nodded.

“O, of course. What reason should I have to harm my eldest brother?”

He even used the word eldest brother which he usually didn’t use.

‘It seems like you sure are pressured. Kuk.’

Simon forcefully swallowed the laughter that was trying to come out.

His sight naturally moved to Kallum.

‘While we were capturing Luke and Mito, bastards like Elton Coat and Gary Renard, that followed Kallum, escaped.’

It was something he came to know from a report of Roan’s, while he was retrieving the battlefield.

‘Sons of bitches.’

He gritted his teeth.

But thanks to that, he gained a good card.

“Kallum. You also think like that too, right?”

“Yes. Yes, of course.”

Kallum replied hurriedly and then frowned.

‘Simon, this bastard. He wouldn’t have the letters I gave to Elton and Gary, right?’

Sour emotions surged up inside of him.

If those letters were revealed here, he would be driven into a corner.

Because it was him that used Luke and Mito to cause that rebellion.

But fortunately, Simon didn’t say anything and just looked at Tommy and Kallum in succession.

It was some kind of threat and pressure.

‘Wait for it. I will tie you up really well.’

The smile on Simon’s mouth became even denser.

He had laid down the trap for now.

Now, he just had to see who would fall for it more.

“To dare to make something like this.”

Bang! Deni III slammed the table with a reddened face.

Simon bowed as if he was waiting for it.

“Don’t worry too much about it. Those bastards aren’t in this world anymore.”

“Mmm.”

Deni III forced himself to calm down and then nodded.

“Right. You have handled it well even in that difficult situation. You are really great.”

Compliments poured out of him.

His original mindset was good, but as he was incompetent, Deni III didn’t know how to act properly in certain circumstances.

He just nodded at Simon’s words, became enraged, and felt joy.

He was just pondering if he had something to give to the dependable eldest son, Simon.

“Ah!”

His face brightened up.

“The land of Aip and Posis became ownerless grounds.”

He spoke with an excited voice.

“Simon Rinse. I will give you the territories of Aip and Posis because of having perfectly carried out the subjugation and overcoming a difficult situation.”

“Ah……”

Cries of exclamation were heard everywhere.

As Aip’s and Posis’ territories were from baron’s, they weren’t that large.

But the location was the problem.

The two territories were located between the capital of Miller and the Pedian Plains, so it was really fertile and a strategic location.

If Simon was to give these two territories to two nobles that supported him, the nobles of the northern region of the kingdom would have to pass through Simon’s forces to enter the capital of Miller.

‘If an urgent thing happens, I can block the path to perfectly cut off the nobles supporting Kallum and Tommy who are also located at the northern region of the kingdom.’

Simon smiled at the greater reward than what he thought he would receive.

Tommy, Kallum, and the nobles supporting them also knew of this truth.

But they couldn’t stand up to oppose to it.

‘Damn. He’s saying that he’s giving the territories of the rebel nobles to the one that suppressed them. There’s no reason to oppose it.’

‘At a slip up, the letters of Prince Tommy may be brought forward.’

‘It’s better to just keep our mouths shut here.’

An uncomfortable silence spread through everywhere.

On the other hand, Simon bowed with a bright expression.

“Thank you, your majesty.”

“No. No. You are the one that raised the greatest merits, but this much isn’t enough.”

Deni III wasn’t thinking of ending the merit awarding ceremony like this.

Then, Simon turned around and shook his head.

“Your majesty. I didn’t do the subjugation and the capture of the rebels by myself. The reason I could raise this great of a merit was because of the help of several people.”

He spoke with a humble attitude and voice.

Simon’s words continued.

“Especially among them, there’s someone that raised a merit so great, it’s unimaginable.”

Right after he finished speaking, Deni III smiled brightly and nodded.

“Aha! If it’s that report, I’m also very aware about that. That…….Ro, Roan was it?”

“Yes. That’s right your majesty.”

Simon nodded and pointed towards his back with his right hand.

Io, Tio, Ralph, and etc. moved to the sides as if they had been waiting for it.

At that moment, Roan, who was standing at the very back, appeared.

He had a childish but manly face.

His deep and clear eyes shone.

Deni III and the others all looked at Roan.

‘That kid is Roan?’

‘I heard that he was as large as a monster…..It seems that it wasn’t true.’

‘That kid raised those amazing merits?’

‘Hoho. For that greenhorn to have rescued the life of Prince Simon.’

Everyone had expressions of disbelief.

Then, Simon’s voice was heard.

“He raised the greatest merits in this subjugation and rescued my life…….”

It was a voice with strength.

“He is Roan Tale.”

Right after he finished speaking, Roan slowly moved up and stood next to Simon.

He kneeled down with a composed and confident posture and saluted.

“Roan Tale greets his majesty.”

Chapter 106




Tl/n (CSV): Apparently, Subak had already translated 106 and simply didn’t publish it. You can thank Subak for this chapter.

Edit: “New Medicine” has been corrected to “God’s Medicine”.

‘Roan Tale?’

‘Tale?’

‘Wasn’t he a commoner?’

The nobles all frowned.

And Deni Von Rinse also had a strange facial expression.

Simon realized that and quickly opened his mouth.

“As the 1st prince of Rinse Kingdom and the owner of the Regate Dagger, I was grateful to Roan and his merits and performances, so with that meaning, I gave him the title of baron.”

“Ah!”

Deni III let out a low cry of exclamation.

He was kind of flustered.

‘I wanted to give him the title of baron as the reward, what do I do?’

However, he cleared his throat and returned to his original demeanor.

This was because of the gazes of several of the nobles.

“Mm.”

The nobles were in silence with complicated expressions on their faces.

‘A commoner troop commander became a baron in one go?’

This was unprecedented.

There were cases where a commoner knight or a baronet became a baron after several years.

But they didn’t become a baron right from the start.

‘It’s an exceptional greeting.’

‘Did he really like him that much?’

Well, looking at it from another perspective, Roan’s merits were indeed amazing.

Because it was to the point where all of the nobles wanted to meet him at least once.

On top of that, it was also their first time seeing someone like Roan.

Geniuses that led the kingdom were mostly graduates from an academy.

And even most of the grand merchants came up from regional academies.

Cases like Roan, who had accumulated enough merits to become a baron despite not having studied at all, were really scare–especially considering how young he was.

But even so, it was a clear thing even if it was difficult for them to admit it.

“Right. Right. If there were this many merits, it’s worthy of doing so.”

The eyes of the king moved towards Roan.

“Baron Roan Tale. The merits you have raised until now were really amazing.”

Roan bowed at the compliment.

“I just did my best as a citizen of the kingdom.”

It was a composed but solid voice.

Deni III looked at that Roan.

‘Ahem. As he had already received the title of baron I should give him something else…….’

It was something he hadn’t expected.

His eyes kept moving towards the place where the dukes were seated.

‘Ugh. I don’t know.’

Deni III had half given up.

“As you have raised the greatest merits in this subjugation, I should give you a reward suitable of that.”

The merit reward started.

Roan bowed and didn’t show any reactions.

Deni III looked at Simon.

“Did you also give him a territory?”

Right after he finished speaking, Simon nodded.

“Yes. Fortunately, Count Io Lancephil gave him the southern part of his region including the region of Tale.”

“Oh! Count Lancephil. You made a hard decision.”

The sight of Deni III moved towards Io.

‘He even gave him territory? This is really troublesome.’

His emotions felt really complicated.

Io didn’t know how Deni III felt and smiled brightly and bowed.

“I was also able to keep my life because of Baron Tale. I just wanted to pay him back.”

“Right. Even so, you’ve made an amazing decision.”

Deni III laughed awkwardly and nodded.

He touched his chin and fell towards his thoughts.

“Then, we are finished with territory…..”

Even if he wanted to proceed with the merit awarding ceremony, he couldn’t think of anything.

Deni III tilted his head and said.

“First, I will give him a reward befitting the hero of the subjugation and exempt the region of Tale from taxes for five years.”

Those were the only things he could think of.

“Mmm.”

The nobles had surprised expressions on their faces.

But even so, they weren’t in a position to stand up and oppose it.

They had obviously expected the reward, and the exemption had happened quite a few times.

But on the other hand, five years was a really long time even when compared to other things.

‘He saved the life of the prince and the count……’

The nobles forced a smile on their faces and applauded Deni III.

However, it seemed like Deni wasn’t planning to end it like this.

He was thinking that it wasn’t enough.

“This much is lacking……Mm.”

Then, Simon, who was looking at the situation, put on a faint smile.

“Your majesty. A bigger reward is impossible even when I look at it. Instead, how about giving him the right to a privilege?”

“A privilege right?”

Deni III asked back with a surprised expression.

And that was also the same for the other nobles.

‘A privilege right……’

‘When was the last time a the right to a privilege was given……..’

It had been such a long time that they couldn’t even remember.

Because of that, everyone had completely forgotten about privilege rights.

“Yes. You should give Baron Tale the rights to a privilege to use it when he has a request, some advice, or a favor to ask.”

“Mmm. The rights to a privilege…………”

The privilege rights were something that existed only in the royal palace.

It was a document given in the name of the king, but the one who had this had to request something which the dukes weren’t opposed to.

In this case, the king had the task and responsibility to listen to the request of the owner.

It may look like a really powerful privilege, but it was actually merely a piece of paper.

‘First, it has to be a request that doesn’t harm the royal palace and even after passing that, it has to get the approval of more than half of the dukes.’

It wasn’t an easy thing to accomplish.

Because mutual understanding was a part of it, you couldn’t request for something grandiose with a privilege right in itself.

All you could do was recommend a genius or ask for forgiveness for a sin.

Even so, the reason Simon brought it to the king.

‘Roan wanted it.’

The reason Simon brought up of the privilege right, which everyone had forgotten about, was because Roan had requested for it.

He had asked him what he wanted from the merit awarding ceremony while coming to the capital of Miller.

‘If he wanted a territory, I would have given it to him even if it was unreasonable….’

However Roan suddenly brought up the privilege rights.

Simon hesitated because it was a document without any meaning, but he followed through with Roan’s will.

‘If it’s Roan, something will be different…….’

He thought of that.

Meanwhile, Deni III, who had fallen into his thoughts, smacked the left armrest of his chair.

Tang!

“Fine! I will give the rights to a privilege to Roan!”

“Thank you, your majesty.”

Simon immediately bowed.

It was to stop the other nobles from butting in.

“Huh?”

“Mm.”

The nobles couldn’t do anything and just glanced at the dukes.

The dukes pondered for a moment but then shook their hands.

‘Even if he tries to do something with it, if we oppose it, it’s the end.’

‘It’s a useless piece of paper.’

There was no need to stand up and gain the enmity of Deni III.

At the reaction of the dukes, the other nobles laughed awkwardly.

Soon, with the order of Deni III, the privilege right was copied.

“Baron Roan Tale. I will be giving you the rights to a privilege for the merits you have accumulated until now.”

At those words, Roan carefully stood up and walked in front of Deni III.

A white piece of paper that was difficult to see, shined brightly.

Roan carefully took it and stepped back.

‘So this is the privilege right…….’

It was something he had heard rumors of in his past life.

There were several reasons why he wanted this.

‘Other’s won’t have anywhere to use this, but I’m different.’

He thought about several large cases and accidents.

‘It’s good if I ask to enter the old library of the kingdom, or visit Habok Prison that’s near the Grain Mountains, or it’s also good to ask for a field trip to the academy.’

For others it would seem useless, but these were all places that held amazing secrets and futures.

However, Roan was discrete.

‘The old library, Habok Prison, the academy, and the other places…… I may be able to enter these places without the privilege right if I work harder.’

He wanted to use the privilege right for the bigger picture.

‘For example……’

His eyes trembled.

‘Tell them to give me the ownerless Poskein Lake……’

A smile appeared on his face.

“Now, next comes Tommy’s and Kallum’s merit awarding ceremony?”

At Deni III words, Tommy and Kallum stood up.

A reward and a villa close to the Mass River was given to the two people.

When comparing it to Simon, it was an unparalleled difference.

After that, the merit awarding ceremonies of the other nobles took place.

After half a day had passed, it had finally ended.

“Then, lastly………”

Deni III looked towards Simon, Tommy, and Kallum and smiled.

“Shall we settle who will be the owner of Grain, just like we had discussed before the subjugation?”

The Grain Great Plains.

The territory to be acquired by the crowned prince of Rinse Kingdom.

It meant that it was a symbol of who would become king.

Simon, Tommy, and Kallum obviously had nervous facial expressions as did several nobles and they all looked towards Deni III.

Deni III put on a weird expression and then shook his head.

“The three people had all raised incredible merits, so I can’t decide on a specific person.”

“Ah…..”

Several cries of exclamation flowed out from everywhere.

Some were covered with dense regret and some with relief.

Simon, who had a faint smile all the time, had his face contort in an instant.

‘Does he mean that it’s not enough with this?!’

It was a feeling that his efforts were being ignored.

At that moment, his heart trembled.

His brown eyes repeatedly turned black several times in a row.

Then, the voice of Deni III was heard.

“But it’s true that Simon is at the front. If time continues like this, Simon will climb to the throne. Hohoho.”

He laughed and looked at Simon.

Only then did Simon calm himself down and bowed.

“I will work harder, your majesty.”

He blamed himself for his hasty behavior.

‘How could you not endure a little dissatisfaction?!’

He felt anxious.

He felt that if he stayed like this, it would really turn bad.

‘My grandfather has to get the God’s Medicine quickly……..’

Simon looked at Duke Bradley Webster with anxious eyes.

Bradley was just smiling brightly and nodding without knowing how Simon was feeling.

“Well! Like this, the boring merit awarding ceremony has ended. Tomorrow we are going to celebrate the victory of the subjugation and host a party. No one is to miss it and everyone is to attend it. Hohoho.”

Deni III laughed in a really joyful voice.

‘It finally finished. Finally! I did well, right?’

His eyes kept going to where the dukes were seated.

“Yes. We will certainly attend, your majesty.”

The nobles all stood up and bowed.

Deni III shook his hand lightly and left the room.

“Whew.”

Several deep sighs came out from everywhere.

At the same time, the nobles that had connections with each other gathered up and talked about the merit awarding ceremony.

Roan neatly folded up the rights to his privilege and then looked up towards the ceiling.

‘Did I just finish one thing now.’

There was a pile of things that he had to finish before leaving the capital of Miller.

‘I will have to move around busily.’

A celebration party was unexpectedly added to that.

One worry passed by his head.

‘When I go to the party……’

His expression slightly changed.

‘What do I wear?’

Roan only had his armor and fighting clothes.

******

‘I can’t get a grip on myself.’

Roan was half astounded because he had to face the nobles that were coming and leaving the room.

Even if he had lived two lives, he didn’t know about a noble’s mannerisms or their world, so because of that, his actions and words were poor.

Especially the mockery and ridicule by the nobles supporting Tommy and Kallum, it really was a displeasing experience.

‘Just wait. I will become someone whom you won’t be able to act as you please.’

He was confident to be able to do so.

He was overflowing with confidence after receiving the title of baron.

‘But anyways, where was the Airin Clothes Store?’

Roan moved busily and checked around him.

He was now trying to find a clothes store to shop at for the party.

Clothes? If it’s clothes, it’s certainly the Airin Clothes Store. It’s the best in the capital of Miller.

These were the words that Simon said to Roan, who was pondering in what to wear for the party.

Roan went to Sears Street, where all the high class stores were located at, after he finished up with the party with the nobles.

However it wasn’t easy to find the Airin Clothes Store amongst the countless stores and crowds.

His feet moved aorund dizzily.

Then.

“It’s been a while. No, I can’t talk informally now.”

A familiar voice spoke out.

Roan turned his head to find the owner of the voice.

“Ah…..”

At that moment, a low sound exclamation came out.

It was a boy looking at him while he was leaning on the wall of a store.

It was obvious that the boy was the son of a noble family just at first glance because of his white skin, well trimmed brown hair, and luxurious clothes.

Roan had met this boy once before.

He put on a faint smile and moved next to the boy.

And at the same time, he extended his right hand with a pleased smile on his face.

“It’s been a while. Sir Ian Phillips.”

******

A luxurious office.

The walls decorated with gold and jewels looked overly luxurious.

“Whew. The merit awarding ceremony was really boring.”

The owner of the voice was none other than Deni Von Rinse.

He leaned his body into a comfortable leather chair and shook his head.

“This much is enough, right?”

It was a different look than what he showed in the previous room.

He was excessively light, so you couldn’t even find a trace of pressure from him.

“Yes. You have done well.”

A heavy and gravelly voice was heard.

Deni III loosened his tight clothes and then said.

“But must I act like this?”

“It’s all for the royal palace of Rinse.”

The solemn voice was heard once again.

The owner of the voice was an old man.

Surprisingly enough, he was one of the four dukes of Rinse kingdom, Francis Wilson.

He, who was the only one that didn’t have a maternal relative, didn’t support any of the three princes and was known to be neutral.

Because of that, he was friends with the three other dukes.

And he was alone with Deni III in this room.

Deni looked at Francis and frowned.

“Francis. When Simon came up with the plan to subjugate the lake, I agreed as you had suggested and promised the throne to the three princes. And the one that raised the greatest merits among the three was Simon. Can’t I just give the territory of Grain to Simon? Then, the competition for the throne will disappear.”

“You can’t yet.”

Francis shook his head.

“What about Tommy? His grandfather is Duke Edwin Voisa. The strongest person in the kingdom. How about giving the plains to Tommy?”

At the questions that were pouring out, Francis replied as if he was whispering.

“Your majesty. You can’t give it to anyone yet. The moment you decide on one prince, the royal palace will end up splitting into three parts. That’s because the three princes still have solid forces. And……”

His words dimmed.

‘I still don’t know if they are suitable for the throne.’

But he didn’t say those words and just swallowed them.

“Anyways, now is the time to gain some balance. Endure it for a little bit more.”

At Francis’s words, Deni III let out a long sigh.

“Whew! Is raising the palace and hunting at the same time that difficult? I can’t even do that as I please. Tch.”

He clicked his tongue and stood up.

The loosened clothes naturally fell.

“Francis. Do you know how difficult it is to memorize everything you tell me? Whew.”

Deni III was annoyed at having to act in front of the nobles.

Francis looked at that and let out a short sigh.

‘Whew. The late king is taking care of his majesty because of his fame but……..’

It was now reaching a limit.

Deni III became less interested in forces as time passed by.

The moments where he had to act had increased as time passed by.

Francis closed his eyes.

‘Simon Rinse, Tommy Rinse, Kallum Rinse. Who will be the real king among them.’

It was troublesome for someone like Deni III to become king again.

‘Then, it’s the end of the royal palace.’

They were barely holding on because of the three dukes keeping the others in check.

Francis felt bitter.

‘If there was someone to break this stifling situation, how good would that be.’

A corner of his heart felt sour.

Chapter 107




Tl/n (CSV): Changed the term “Roan’s agency” to “Agens”, as it is in the raws.

“It’s really amazing. Really.”

He lost count of how many times he had said amazing.

Now Roan just simply smiled.

At the sight of this, Ian Phillips, who had been fussing about, became even more excited.

“During the monster outbreak, the only place that had taken no damage was the Tale region.

His face was flushed red.

And the voice matched his facial expression.

Finally, Roan smiled brightly and spoke.

“You are quite well-informed in the kingdom’s affairs.”

Ian clapped at Roan’s words.

Unmistakable pride appeared in one corner of his face.

He motioned his hand towards a corner of the diner.

Soon, a young man quickly walked over.

A familiar face.

It was someone who Roan had already met.

“It has been a long time since my last greeting. It’s Oren.”

He reintroduced himself with a polite speech and manners.

The young man was Oren, the head of the information agency Evishun, that Ian founded.

He was the very same man who fought with Pens over the location of the supply storage facility during the last war against the Istel Kingdom.

Smiling brightly, Ian pointed at Oren.

“After hearing Sir Baron Tale’s advice, I created an information group and I’m gathering a variety of news through it.”

Roan wordlessly nodded.

His gaze naturally turned toward Oren.

‘It’s a face full of confidence.’

Most likely, he grew one step further after the previous event

Noticing Roan’s gaze, Oren bowed once more.

“I learned many things from the last experience. Thank you.”

“If you think so, then I’m glad.”

Roan nodded as he slightly smiled.

Seeing this, Ian slapped his knee.

“Didn’t Sir Baron Tale also create an information agency? I heard our Evishun learned a lot from it.”

“It was simply luck.”

A modest demeanor.

But Ian once again chattered on for a long time with a feverish look on his face.

“No. It’s truly amazing. At this moment, the best information group in the kingdom is probably Sir Baron Tale’s agency.”

Even he didn’t knew the exact name of the Agens.

Roan happily smiled and shook his head.

“Evishun is also excellent.”

He was being honest.

If Evishun, which used the capital, Miller, as the base, and knew information about the East, it meant that its influence was incredibly large and precise.

In case of Agens, the agency’s organization, information collection, and abilities of analysis were extremely superb but was still small time; currently it was only collecting information from the kingdom’s east, centered around the Tale region.

‘Let’s slowly expand.’

He must have the entire Rinse Kingdom and later, the entire continent’s information in his hands.

An unusual smile formed on Roan’s mouth.

It was a smile that was mixed with expectation and confidence.

‘If it’s Chris, he can definitely pull it off.’

After that, Roan and Ian talked for a long time.

From about creating the information agency, to its uses, the tactics and strategies in the war and punitive expeditions, the towns and roads’ maintenance, and even about the region’s management, the topics of discussion were numerous.

“Hu, it’s really amazing. To think that you managed to do so many things….”

Ian’s expression was one of astonishment.

He was truly impressed.

Because he knew very aware of how amazing and difficult the things that Roan had done within such a short amount of time.

Roan simply smiled without a word.

Then.

“Ah!”

Ian cried out with a low voice as if he suddenly had a good idea.

With a mischievous expression, he spoke with a quiet tone.

“If there’s perhaps a good time in the next few days, would you please visit Tron Academy?”

“Tron Academy?”

Tron Academy was located in Miller, the capital, and was the most prestigious, and oldest, academy in the Kingdom of Rinse.

Ian was a student at Tron Academy, and Simon Rinse, Tommy Rinse, and Kallum Rinse had all graduated from Tron Academy.

“Yes. Incidentally, it’s searching for someone to give a special lecture. If one of the most renowned people within the kingdom at the moment, Sir Baron Tale, were to give a special lecture, all of the academy’s students will surely be thankful.”

“Hhm.”

A special lecture.

It was something he hadn’t expected at all.

‘It it’s lectures then it’s troublesome.’

Usually, he would’ve definitely declined.

But.

‘It’s a good chance to find out about academy management.’

For Roan who planned to create an academy in the Tale region, it was an excellent opportunity.

He contemplated for a moment, then cautiously asked.

“Would it be alright for a countryside nobody like me to have this opportunity?”

At these words, Ian shook his hands with a shocked facial expression.

“What do you mean a countryside nobody? The Kingdom’s hero shouldn’t be saying such words.”

Certainly, Roan’s popularity at the moment was greatly significant.

The nobles couldn’t easily approach because of their pride and standings, but other people of significance greatly yearned to meet Roan.

Roan smiled lightly and nodded.

“Then. I will visit three days later.”

“Thank you. I will inform the director beforehand.”

Ian’s expression was jubilant.

‘I might be able to learn something brilliant just like from the previous discussion about the information agency.”

His chest jumped from expectation.

Ian was a genius but wasn’t conceited or overconfident.

He was a boy who could see what he lacked and learned by himself.

Perhaps it was this quality that gave birth to the strategist of the future generation.

Ian laughed in happiness then coughed after he noticed Roan’s gaze a bit late.

“Hm. Then I’ll anticipate the day three days later.”

“If the anticipation is big, the disappointment will be just as big.”

Roan shook his hand as he smiled bitterly.

Thinking back upon the various events from Roan’s words, Ian shook his head.

“I’m not sure. Sir Baron Tale has been going beyond my expectations until now. So this time……”

His eyes bent to become crescent shaped.

Unmissable happiness rose from him.

“I’ll have even more anticipation.”

Even then, Roan seemed as if he would go even further.

Ian looked at Roan with a composed gaze.

‘A person whose growth limit is imperceivable.’

His heart beat rapidly.

‘Viscount? Count? Marquis? Duke? Lieutenant General? General? Supreme Commander? Or perhaps …’

Ian soon shook his head.

Thoughts beyond that point were disrespectful and dangerous.

But the thoughts remained.

Although the head kept pushing it out, the heart passionately burned.

Roan was a person like that.

‘A person who can make people’s hearts excited.”

Ian’s lips slowly crept upwards .

*****

“Idiots!”

A sharp voice yelled out.

“Apologies.”

Five clean looking young men lowered their heads.

Utter terror could be seen on their faces.

“Chandler. Are these fools really apt?”

The tension moved towards somewhere else.

The elderly man watching from the side, Chandler Hughes, quickly replied back.

“Amongst the ones who aren’t known, these guys are amongst the top ten.”

“And they’re still in this sorry state?”

The sharp voice poured down once more.

The owner of the voice was Count Jonathan Chase.

At the moment, he had called and was yelling at the spies sent to infiltrate the Amaranth troop.

One of the young men spoke with a distressed voice.

“But if we could come to the capital Miller with Commander Roan, we should be accepted a…”

“Shut it!”

Jonathan shrieked.

He clicked his tongue while looking at the young men.

“Tch tch tch. Don’t be satisfied just because they came alongside him to the capital. Just what can I do while trusting these things… tch.”

His disgust and irritation was palpable.

The young men became further dispirited and cowered in fear.

Then, Chandler spoke up in a cautious tone.

“What if we help them raise up merits?

“Merit?”

Jonathan asked back while he was frowning.

Chandler shook his head.

“Yes. Make them raise up merits large enough to come into Roan’s eyes. Then, wouldn’t he assign them important works?”

“Hhm.”

Jonathan quietly mused.

It wasn’t a bad idea.

Chandler didn’t miss this chance.

“According to these men’s words, Roan is recruiting more blacksmiths, engineers, and alchemists and is trying to maintain a magic tower. Furthermore, he seems to be preparing this and that to build an academy.”

“Hmph! The greed of a mere brat who just became a baron is quite excessive.”

Jonathan shook his head with a flabbergasted look on his face.

Chandler continued on with a slight smile.

“Certainly his greed is exorbitant. Most likely it won’t be easy.”

He spoke in a subtle voice.

Jonathan realized the meaning of Chandler’s words at once.

“You are suggesting that we should use these guys to help one of Roan’s plans succeed?”

“Yes. That is so.”

“Hhm. Not bad.”

Jonathan nodded as he rubbed his chin.

Soon, he twisted his fingers at Chandler.

“Do it. But in return……”

The look he gave off and his voice turned cold.

“You will have to produce results this time.”

At those words, Chandler, as well as the dejected young men, bowed.

“Yes. Understood.”

“We shall do the best that we can.”

Their voices shook at the end.

The young men knew that this was their last chance.

‘If we were to make a mistake……”

‘We might die.’

That couldn’t happen.

The five young men curled their fists.

It was an expression of their will to definitely succeed, or perhaps to not die.

The tightly clenched fists shuddered quietly.

*****

The royal palace dance hall.

A splendid hall and beautiful tune, the sound of young men and women’s laughs and chatter.

A vicious battle of aura between the nobles that could decide the kingdom’s prosperity and downfall.

New meetings and the thirst that always followed.

In short, the royal palace’s dance hall was a place that everyone dreamt of at least once, and everyone wished to attend at least once.

‘I’m a bit anxious…….’

Roan fixed his cuffs many times in front of the hall’s entrance.

Including his last life, he lived on the battlefield.

A place where life comes and goes with a single gesture.

But there wasn’t a time when he felt this nervous even on the battlefield.

‘I’m also unused to these kinds of clothes.’

A clean suit.

With a design similar to the kingdom knight’s uniform and with the strong contrast of black and white, the suit gave off a strong vibe.

The suit’s design complemented Roan’s masculine looks well and gave off a clean look unlike when he wore armor.

The words clothes are wings fit perfectly.

“Sir Baron Tale. Are you not going in?”

The attendants guarding the hall entrance carefully asked.

Roan awkwardly smiled and took in a deep breath.

And after checking his clothes one more time, he nodded his head.

“I’m going in.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the attendants pressed against the gigantic hall door.

The large door soundlessly opened left and right.

Roan unknowingly exhaled.

At the edge of his ears, he could hear beautiful music.

The wide open entrance.

Roan slowly moved his feet.

A fearless and confident expression and gait.

The look of nervousness from just a moment ago had completely disappeared.

“Hhm?”

“Eh?”

“Is he perhaps?”

“It’s Baron Roan Tale.”

The people’s gazes suddenly poured down on Roan.

The high nobles, who had already met Roan before, attempted to show indifference and leisure, while the nobles below and the invited figures of influence showed great interest.

Roan didn’t panic or act timid under the people’s gaze.

He stood at the center of the hall and looked around at the people.

‘Brilliant.’

He wasn’t talking about the hall itself.

He was talking about how the faces of the people filling up the hall were brilliant.

‘It feels as if all the main characters of the future historical events are gathered here.’

Various small events and incidents quickly went through his head.

At that moment, a familiar voice rang out.

“Baron Roan Tale! Over here.”

The owner of the voice was Simon.

As Roan turned his gaze towards the voice, he briefly shuddered.

‘The rumor was true.’

The story he had heard from Ian.

Prince Simon Rinse’s fashion sense is a complete mess. A mess.

He could see that the rumor about Simon’s abysmal fashion sense was true.

He definitely wore a clean-cut suit, but Roan’s eyes shook.

From the top to the bottom, and even down to the shoes; even imagining how many different colors went into it was impossible.

It was the very definition of an awkward color palette.

‘I’m glad that I met Ian.’

Instead of the store that Simon recommended, Roan got his clothes from the Ropil Boutique that Ian recommended.

If he hadn’t, he would undoubtedly be wearing a suit just like Simon’s.

Pacifying his shocked heart, Roan moved his feet.

“Aren’t your clothes a bit too colorless?”

Simon outright critiqued the outfit.

“It seems that the Airin clothes store was closed.”

Roan lightly excused himself and changed the topic.

“The dance hall is larger than I imagined.”

Io, who was standing nearby, lightly smiled at those words and answered.

“Not only the expedition from this time, this dance hall is also for celebrating the victory against Istel Kingdom.”

“Come to think of it, what happened to the postwar remunerations?”

The one that invaded first was Istel Kingdom and the one that lost was also Istel Kingdom.

But the war took place inside Rinse Kingdom’s territory.

As a result, the kingdom’s east took considerable damage.

The postwar settlement was an important issue.

“It seems to be proceeding with a good condition. From what I heard……”

Io’s voice grew quieter.

“We might be getting the western region of Istel Kingdom.”

“I see.”

Roan made a reasonably shocked face.

But inside, he was unperturbed.

‘It was like that in the last life.’

Istel Kingdom currently didn’t have enough wealth to pay war reparations.

Because the crop harvest took an enormous dive due to the Poskein Exodus, the entire kingdom’s economy was bankrupt.

In the last life as well, the Istel Kingdom settled the reparations by handing over the western region to Rinse Kingdom.

‘And war started once again thanks to that region.’

Roan smiled bitterly on the inside.

‘Come to think of it……”

As he reminisced of the last life, he remembered the things that he temporarily forgot.

‘I need to buy the Istel Kingdom’s farmland before it’s too late.’

Currently, Istel Kingdom’s farmers couldn’t take on the drop in crop yield and were selling the farmlands that they owned cheaply.

Even then, there was no one who went up to buy them.

Because everything dried up regardless of whichever crops they planted.

And as a result, the price of the farmlands continued to fall.

‘But starting next year, the crop yield will increase exponentially.’

Even after the Poskein Exodus had ended, the harvest continued to be extremely successful.

Thanks to that, in his last life, there was an event where the farmers who kept their farms in the end became big time farmers.

‘To increase my power, there must a plentiful supply of food.’

There was a need to feed the region’s people and to keep the soldiers well-fed.

Roan began to build a plan to buy the farms inside his head.

Then.

“Roan. What are you thinking about?”

Simon tapped his shoulder and smiled.

“Ah, I must’ve tensed up because I’m new to dance halls.”

After skillfully answering back, Roan looked at Simon.

‘Hhm?’

Suddenly, the light in his eyes shook.

It was because an unfamiliar woman stood next to Simon.

The woman was very beautiful and attractive.

Especially her soft looking eyeline and the slightly raised mouth ends gave off a pleasant vibe.

Seeing this, Simon brightly smiled.

“Do introduce yourself. She’s my fiance. Rodite of Marquis Page’s house.”

Soon as the introduction finished, Rodite Page slightly bowed her head.

“I am Rodite Page. It’s an honor to meet Sir Baron Roan Tale, the hero of the expedition.”

“Ah……”

Roan quietly exclaimed.

It wasn’t because Rodite’s voice was beautiful.

‘Rodite Page……”

The reason Roan was shocked.

It was because of her name.

‘So this woman is……”

He unknowingly frowned.

‘The one who turned Prince Simon into the mad monarch.’

The start of the abysmal future was this Rodite.

“Roan?”

Simon tilted his head at Roan who didn’t move despite Rodite’s greeting.

“Ah.”

Roan composed himself a bit late and quickly lowered his head.

“I am Roan Tale.”

Simon chuckled at the sight.

“Aren’t you a bit strange today? You seem a bit off for some……”

But he couldn’t finish his words.

Because he heard a high-pitched voice from behind him.

“Big brother!”

Suddenly, Simon’s face crumpled.

Forming a bitter smile, he shrugged.

“The tomboy lady seems to have arrived.”

At those words, Roan’s expression solidified once more.

The one Simon called a tomboy lady.

‘Princess Katy Rinse.’

Among the many princesses, there were two reason why Roan remember Katy’s name.

One was that she was the only sister of mad monarch.

And the other one.

‘Ten years from now, she becomes Pierce’s wife.’

Mad monarch and Pierce.

The two who had the most tragic relationship even amongst the big four of Rinse Kingdom.

The link between the two was Katy Rinse.

Chapter 108




Tl/n (CSV): Regular chapter. Hopefully, I’ll have the sponsored chapter uploaded by tomorrow night. Also, the title of the arc has been changed from “Amends”(改善) to “Triumphant Return”(凱旋). Both same spelling and pronunciation, but completely different meaning.

Edit: “Seil” has been correctly changed to “Sale”.

Roan clearly remembered the wars, the battles, and the big and small events that happened in both the kingdom and the continent, but there were also parts that he didn’t remember.

Particularly, events he didn’t personally experience, his knowledge was no better than a blank page.

Obviously, Rodite Page and Katy Rinse fit into this category.

‘Especially since I only heard the rumors and don’t know what sort of people they really are.’

At most, he remembered that in Pierce’s case, he took flight for a while, running away from Katy.

‘Princess Katy really loved Pierce a lot.’

It was a case of love at first sight, word for word.

‘Big brother!’

Once again, he heard a shrill voice.

At the same time, a snowy faced cute girl showed herself.

“Annette and Anna sis are bullying me.”

Annette Rinse was the second prince, Tomy Rinse’s, little sister and Anna Rinse was the third prince, Kallum Rinse’s, little sister.

An angry faced Katy.

Simon smiled as if he found her expression cute.

“So did you let them?”

Katy balled her fist as soon as his words ended.

“No way. I pulled out both of their hair.”

Suddenly, Simon laughed out loud.

“Hahahaha! Good. That’s my sister! Nice job.”

Raising his thumb at Katy, he continued.

“An eye for an eye. Do that, and others won’t be able to look down on you. Got it?”

“Un. Got it. I’ll remember.”

Katy nodded her head.

Her expression was serious, but due to her large eyes and face full of playfulness, she looked tomboyish instead.

Roan bitterly smiled inwardly.

‘To think such happy siblings would…”

Due to a complicated and twisted relationship, they would point their swords at each other.

At that moment, Katy’s line of sight turned toward Roan.

“Who’s this?”

Looking at Roan, who wasn’t much older than her compared to the others, she tilted her head.

Simon widened his shoulders as he sniggered.

“That person is the hero of this expedition and the savior of this brother’s life, Baron Roan Tale.”

“Ah!”

Katy exclaimed with a slightly surprised expression.

Her eyes glinted with interest.

‘He’s completely different than what I thought.’

Hearing his records, she imagined a macho giant.

But although Roan’s body was in fact extremely fit, he looked rather normal.

“I am Roan Tale.”

Roan deeply bowed as he introduced himself.

Only then did Katy extend her right hand and slightly lowered her head.

“Hello. I’m Katy Rinse.”

“It’s an honor to meet you, princess.”

Holding her hand, Roan gave a short military salute.

For a while, Katy scrutinized Roan’s face here and there.

‘He doesn’t look like much on the outside……’

She couldn’t believe such an ordinary looking guy raised such an extraordinary achievement.

‘Should I perhaps test……’

As she was mischievously planning.

The music that filled the hall suddenly stopped.

Everyone turned toward the front of the hall.

As if he was waiting, the kingdom’s Grand Chamberlain, Viscount Logan Dale, showed up.

With an enormous staff, he knocked three times on the marble floor.

“The kingdom’s sun, the proxy of our God Krea, his majesty Deni III is entering. All the kingdom’s loyal subjects, show respect.”

As soon as the introduction ended, a grand music filled the hall.

Through the wide open doors, Deni Von Rinse showed up in a magnificent suit.

Behind him, the queen and royal concubines followed.

Deni III exchanged greetings with the powerful nobles and heated up the dance hall’s mood.

Simon, and the nobles that followed him, also tried to get in Deni III’s line of sight and put up a fierce fight.

On the other hand, Roan searched for the ordinary guests that attended the hall instead of Deni III.

Meeting with famous philosophers, magicians, and even the big merchants that traded mainly around Miller, Roan put in all kind of efforts to pull in or fill up the things that the Tale region needed.

“Huu. It’s harder than I thought.”

Roan, who had been moving around the dance hall the entire time, walked toward a corner of the hall.

He met countless people and made various offers, but nothing was truly achieved.

Everyone was merely satisfied with simply making an acquaintance with Roan.

They didn’t attempt to make any connections deeper than necessary with Roan, who just became a noble from a commoner background.

Even the commoner merchants tried to line up with other powerful nobles rather than Roan.

An evaluation that Roan’s background wasn’t stable enough to make any profound connections.

‘It won’t become easy from now on either.’

Roan painfully smiled.

He didn’t think from the start that everything would go well.

If he continued to raise his strength and expand his influence, they will extend their hands to him first.

‘I’ll make sure they’ll become like that.’

Scanning the sight of the dance hall continuing on noisily and luxuriously, Roan drank the expensive wine.

A bitter taste filled his mouth.

‘Everyone’s fitting in really well.’

The only one that was out of place in this dance hall was Roan.

‘Hm?’

Then, Roan’s brows slightly furrowed.

His sight turned towards a corner on the right side.

‘It seems that there’s someone else besides me that doesn’t match the dance hall.’

Curiosity colored his eyes.

On the right side’s corner, a young woman sat there.

A woman with a faint smile, enjoying her wine.

Although she wore a plain looking dress compared to the others, she somehow exuded an elegant grace.

Unconsciously, Roan kept staring at her.

Then, the woman’s gaze, that was watching the dance, suddenly turned.

For a moment, Roan and the woman’s eyes met.

“Hhm.”

Unable to avoid her gaze, Roan awkwardly smiled and lightly lowered his head.

The woman too, at their unexpected intersected gazes, quickly lowered her head in panic.

Both of her cheeks blushed.

An awfully shy look.

Roan smiled at that sight.

He wasn’t sure why, but he felt a corner of his heart relax.

At that moment.

“Roan.”

Checking the mood, Ian Lancephil walked over.

He, who was walking over after finishing a short chat with Deni III, saw Roan and made a peculiar expression.

“She’s Princess Aily Rinse.”

He abruptly threw Roan a few words.

Roan wasn’t sure at first what he was talking about, but soon realized what he meant.

‘She’s a princess.’

The woman who couldn’t fit in with the dance and was sitting alone by a corner just like him.

Surprisingly, her identity was in fact the kingdom’s princess.

‘Was there a princess called Aily?’

He searched his memory including the one from his last life, but couldn’t remember such a person.

Most likely, she was married off to a noble just like other princesses and spent her life without any tribulations.

Then, Io continued his words.

“Princess Aily’s mother was a maid in the palace. Because of that, she doesn’t have any followers or supporters unlike other princes and princesses. Furthermore, her mother’s life ended merely three days after giving birth to the princess. Because of that, the only one in the world related to her by blood is his majesty the king. But……”

His line of sight turned towards Deni III.

“His majesty, the king, doesn’t seem to hold Princess Aily very dearly. I never saw the two of them talk to each other by themselves.”

A bitter countenance filled his face.

“The loneliest and saddest person within the palace is probably Princess Aily. Probably because she doesn’t have a relationship with anyone besides her Guardian Knight and the wet nurse that looked after her since she was young.”

To spend time on Aily, who didn’t have any power or influence, the kingdom and its current situation wasn’t very favorable to do so.

‘Hhm.’

Roan somehow swallowed the thoughts that rose up to his throat.

Somehow, it felt similar to his current state.

A former commoner officer that just became a noble.

Although he hooked people’s eyes for a moment thanks to the fame from the war and the expedition, that much was the limit.

For Roan, whose background was low, people tried to keep a certain amount of distance.

“She’s a pitiful person. She’s the same without any friends or family.”

Io let out a short sigh.

At that moment, the music that was filling the hall, changed.

The royalty and the nobles, and the guests as well, began searching for a partner as if they had been waiting.

“Sir Count Lancephil. Will you dance with me for a song?”

Even to Io, a noblewoman walked over and extended her hand.

Winking at Roan, Io soon headed toward the center of the hall.

‘So this is the aristocratic society.’

It might seem like beautiful dances on the outside, but in truth, there should be bloody politics flying back and forth.

Roan unconsciously turned his sight looking for Aily.

She had moved her seat further into the corner than before.

Although she was a kingdom’s princess in name, nobody in the hall requested a dance from her.

From another perspective, it was same for Roan.

Even though it was an etiquette for the men to offer the dance first, there were times when the women approach first.

But there were no women that walked up to Roan.

Although old ladies amongst the guests sent passionate glances from time to time, Roan struggled to ignored the gazes.

Roan’s sight kept going toward Aily.

“Is there really no one to dance with?”

“Hmph. Really.”

The young girls sitting on the left side complained with small voices.

Glancing over the men in the hall, the girls frowned.

“There’s only old nobles.”

“All the good men were taken by the princesses.”

A brusque voice.

Then, the girls’ expression brightened for a moment.

“Look. It seems Princess Aily didn’t find a partner again today.”

“That’s why she gets the nickname shadow princess.”

He could hear sneering voices.

Roan unconsciously turned and faced the girls.

“Hhm.”

“Hm.”

Sensing Roan’s gaze, the girls were coquettishly laughing.

Lightly tapping at their neck, they let down a shoulder.

Roan squinted an eye.

It wasn’t from the girls’ behavior.

‘A shadow princess……’

Somehow, he felt bitter.

He didn’t know why. His heart moved on its own.

Roan turned his head again toward Aily.

She didn’t seem to care what others said and thought about her.

Her expression was unperturbed and her eyes were deep and bright.

“Huu.”

Roan let out a short sigh and slowly moved his feet.

Io, who had been staring at Roan even while dancing in the center of the hall, made a strange expression.

‘Yes, Roan. If it’s you, you’ll be able to see beyond her outer appearance and conditions and into her true self.’

His mouth slightly curved up.

All the while, Roan went up to Aily.

“Hello. Princesss. I’m Roan Tale.”

“Ah…… You’re the hero of the expedition. I heard you saved my…… brother Simon.”

She hesitated for a moment at the word brother.

‘Her voice is really clear and gentle.’

Roan unconsciously smiled.

Aily too softly smiled and lightly bowed.

“I am Aily Rinse.”

It was a smile that made one feel happy just as much as her voice.

On top of that, she was polite and courteous.

Roan quietly gazed at her two eyes.

Aily calmly stared back at the gaze, but soon slightly lowered her head.

Both of her cheeks were once again colored red.

‘A shadow princess…..’

His eyes calmly squinted.

‘There’s nothing as truthful and definite as a shadow.’

Roan extended his right hand toward Aily.

“Princess. Would you dance with me for a song?”

A soft voice.

Dance, and a kind of dance that nobles do; he never danced nor had a chance to even take a good look at one, but that didn’t matter.

‘Even if it’s wrong or awkward, I think that it would be fine.’

Strangely, he felt calm.

Aily raised her head and stared at Roan.

Without a word, Roan brightly smiled.

Quietly, the two gazes met.

A moment after, Aily shyly smiled and nodded.

“I would like to.”

*****

“Nanny.”

Aily’s voice slightly trembled at the end.

“Princess. You’re a bit late today.”

Margaret, the nanny, who had been cleaning the study, brightly smiled and lowered her head.

Usually, Aily wasn’t one to stay at a dance for long.

‘Since others look down on her saying something like shadow princess or whatnot……’

No, in the first place, Aily wasn’t one to enjoy dance halls.

‘But today, she stayed for quite a while.’

Margaret’s gaze turned towards the guardian knight, Greg Katis, who was naturally standing by the door.

Sensing Margaret’s gaze, Greg faintly smiled.

An expression as if something good happened today.

‘What happened?’

Tilting her head, Margaret looked at Aily.

“Ah……”

Only then did she realize that Aily’s expression was very bright.

A gleeful expression as if she had the whole world.

“Nanny.”

Aily’s face was brightly blushing.

“I met someone good today.”

A calm yet somehow slightly raised voice.

“So, someone good?”

Margaret made a surprised expression at the completely unexpected words.

On the other hand, Aily was still calm and composed.

“Un. Someone good.”

Margaret slightly frowned.

And soon glanced at Greg.

Greg slightly nodded at Margaret’s gaze and walked out of the study.

Standing in front of the door and meticulously checking if there was anyone walking that way or hiding, he heightened his senses.

His figure was natural, as if something like this had happened multiple times before.

Margaret looked around just in case, and whispered with a small voice.

“Princess. What do you suddenly mean, someone good?”

Aily faintly smiled at those words.

“I met the expedition’s hero, Baron Roan Tale.”

“Roan Tale……”

Margaret was also very familiar with the rumors about Roan.

She asked again in a careful voice.

“And you say that he’s a good person?”

“Un. We talked a bit while we danced and he was a really good person in various ways.”

At Aily’s reply, Margaret’s expression turned stiff.

“A dance? Did Baron Tale offer the dance first?”

Aily lightly nodded her head.

Margaret’s voice became even smaller.

“You didn’t say anything strange first, did you?”

“Anything strange?”

Aily asked back with a smile.

Margaret looked around the place once more.

“Things like a house leasing business, rail transportation, or Sale Trading…….”

“Stop.”

Aily raised her right hand and shook her head.

Margaret quickly closed her mouth.

Staring into her eyes, Aily faintly smiled.

“Nanny. Don’t worry about something like that because I never let something slip from my tongue.”

A dignified and confident expression unlike the shy look from before.

Margaret exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. But even so…… there wasn’t a single incident like this before. Just in case……”

A worry filled voice.

Aily tightly squeezed Margaret’s two hands.

“Nanny. Don’t worry. The man called Roan Tale, he’s surely a good person.”

A clear and gentle voice echoed from her lips.

Margaret’s expression relaxed when she heard her.

‘Right. Since princess’s eyes for people are exact.”

Until now, it hadn’t been wrong even a single time.

Because of that, they could do unimaginable things without anyone knowing about it.

‘A good person……”

Margaret recalled the rumors about Roan that she had heard.

‘What kind of a good person is he? A friend? Or perhaps……”

Her heart thumped for some reason.

It was a feeling mixed with anticipation.

A strange mood filled the study.

“Our agents are collecting and analyzing the information from the region around Miller Castle.”

Keep finished his report and stepped back.

Roan sat on a chair with his legs crossed and deeply immersed in thought.

The long coat he wore to the dance slipped down the chair.

‘Princess Aily……’

Somehow, Aily’s face filled his head.

‘Why am I so concerned about her?’

Love?

‘No way.’

Roan shook his head.

He and Aily never met before today.

Also, there was no way that Roan, who was living his second life, didn’t know the feeling of love.

No, he thought he knew.

‘Was there some sort of connection in the last life?’

Even Roan can’t remember everything.

It was possible that there is a memory related to Aily among those that he thought wasn’t important.

He rubbed the tip of his chin while furrowing his forehead.

“Sir Baron?”

At that sight, Keep nervously stared at Roan.

Since his time in the 7th Squad of Rose troop until now, he had been watching Roan’s side.

Because he was fast and quick-witted, he became the head of the information squad when Amaranth troop was made.

Keep realized Roan’s expression was different than usual.

Worries about whether there may be a problem in the mission surged through his mind.

“Hmm. Sorry.”

Roan organized his thoughts a step late and turned towards Keep.

“Excellent. Continue to actively use the agents to gather as much information as possible.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Keep lowered his head with a look of relief.

Then, Roan hesitated for a moment and then raised his right hand.

“Ah. And by the way……”

He lost his words for a bit and wavered.

After breathing in and out several times, he whispered in a small voice.

“Within the information you gathered and analyzed, is there perhaps anything about Princess Aily Rinse?”

“Princess Aily Rinse?”

Keep tilted his head.

“I’ll have to check separately for anything specific, but I don’t really remember anything special…… ah!”

As he continued his words, Keep suddenly exclaimed.

Staring at Roan, he asked in a cautious voice.

“Are you perhaps talking about the shadow princess?”

“Yeah. That’s right. The shadow princess.”

On Roan’s face, a slight look of expectation had appeared.

For some reason, Keep whispered in a small voice.

“Around last year or so, it seems that the shadow princess caught a serious disease.”

“Serious disease? What kind of disease?”

Roan frowned.

Keep shrugged his shoulders.

“We’re not exactly sure. It was a rumor going around Miller’s residents. Because the princess hadn’t appear ever since last Fall to this Spring, it seems that everyone thought that she had been sick.”

“Didn’t appear ……”

Roan squinted his eyes.

‘If such rumor started to run even amongst the castle’s citizens, even the royal family wouldn’t stay still.”

At the moment, he unconsciously held a great interest in Aily.

“Keep.”

“Yes. Sir Baron.”

Keep lowered his head.

Roan gave a new order in a low voice.

“Gather some information on the palace and the royal family. Even rumors and ghost stories like this one is fine.”

“The, the royal family?”

With a surprised expression, Keep asked back.

Roan nodded his head.

“Secretly. Don’t go burrowing too deep.”

If they weren’t careful, they could earn hostility from the palace.

Calming down his shocked heart, Keep lowered his head.

“Yes. Understood.”

Certainly, it wasn’t an easy mission.

But it wasn’t impossible either.

‘Let’s show the information squad’s ability.’

He wanted to show something that could match the Agens, no, an appearance that is greater than Agens.

‘And although he said the palace and the royal family……’

His eyes quickly spun.

‘It seems that he is interested in the shadow… no, Princess Aily.’

As expected of Keep.

‘Sir Baron. Just believe in me and the Information squad.’

He clenched his fist.

Roan, perhaps knowing his thoughts or perhaps not, stared at Keep and smiled.

‘That’s it. Compete together, grow together.’

Still water is doomed to rot.

With a satisfied expression, Roan stood up.

‘Then, is Tron Academy the next……’

His heart trembled.

In the last life, it was a place he couldn’t attend even if he wanted to.

‘Will something happen again at that place?’

The smile on his mouth grew deeper.

*****

Roan’s dream was big.

It was different than an ambition or a desire.

It was pure and hot.

Because of that, he learned words despite being a commoner and bought and collected all sorts of books.

And to him, the academy was like a holy land.

‘I really wanted to go there.’

Looking at the grand entrance to Tron Academy, Roan bitterly smiled.

A place where he wanted to, but couldn’t attend.

There were various reasons why, but the biggest reasons were his standing, wealth, and time.

To attend the academy, he needed to at least be from a noble family or have a noble’s recommendation.

Additionally, he needed to pay a colossal tuition fee and spend four years there until graduation.

To Roan, it was a place that he could only stare at.

“I heard that there’s a special lecture from Baron Tale?”

“Baron Tale bullsh*t. It’s Roan, Roan.”

“Yeah. For an exiled convict, he got lucky and became a Baron overnight.”

“He became like that because he caught the prince’s eye.”

The academy’s students that passed by Roan began babbling words of ridicule.

They didn’t recognize Roan at all.

‘Noble’s kids……’

Roan smiled bitterly.

The mindset of the students that should be leading the kingdom was too laughable and immature.

Following the students that continued to complain, he moved his feet.

The ones walking in the front stole a glance behind.

“What?”

“Is he someone you know?”

“Don’t know. Is he a first year? Or maybe a transfer student?”

The students frowned and whispered between themselves.

They couldn’t imagine that Roan, the hero of the expedition and the one who recently became a Baron, might be around the same age as them.

Since the academy’s fourth year student’s age was nineteen, there was merely a difference of a single year away from Roan.

When the students’ eyes met his, Roan smiled at them.

“What? Why is he smiling?”

“Who’s he supposed to be?”

The students’ expressions twisted.

That moment.

“Ah! You came?”

From far away, he heard a familiar voice.

Roan’s and the students’ gazes followed the voice.

‘It’s Ian Phillips.’

The owner of the voice was Ian.

Waving his hand, Ian ran from the academy’s main building.

“Hhm. He’s that Ian Phillips, right?”

“Right. The firstborn of Count Phillips and Miller Castle’s, no the kingdom’s greatest genius.”

“He’s a freshman that started this year.”

“Yeah. Doesn’t he look like he’s greeting us?”

The students pointlessly came to their own conclusions.

“I thought he would be arrogant since he’s the firstborn of a count on top of being a genius.”

“It looks like he’s quite the well-mannered brat.”

Then, the brats awkwardly waved.

Before they knew it, Ian was right in front of them.

“Yes. Good to see you. Ian. I’m the fourth year Pi……”

When the student at the front introduced himself.

“Excuse me.”

Ian pushed the students to the left and right and went up to Roan.

“Eh?”

“What?”

The brats who were pushed aside frowned and looked at Ian.

Their eyes naturally focused on Roan and Ian.

Ian bowed right away.

“Welcome. Sir Baron Tale.”

“For you to even come out to meet me, thank you very much.”

A fair and clear voice rode the wind into the students’ ears.

“Huk!”

“Ba, Baron Tale?”

“He’s that Roan?”

With a completely shocked expression, the brats looked at Roan.

When Roan met their gazes, he brightly smiled and slightly nodded his head.

“Hph!”

The students gulped and quickly lowered their heads.

However much they insulted and looked down upon Roan, they couldn’t keep their heads up in front of a kingdom’s noble.

“Si, Sir Baron Tale. A, about our talk just now……”

The voice sharply shook.

Although they were certainly sons of nobles, their positions weren’t something that could hold up against Roan who held a true title of nobility.

Roan cheerfully smiled and stood in front of them.

Ian tilted his head, wondering what had happened.

“It’s okay.”

A gentle voice.

Roan extended his hand and brushed each of their head.

A completely natural and adult-like act.

At the unexpected hand, the students who had their heads lowered bit their lips.

‘Damn it. He’s completely treating us like kids.’

Even so, they couldn’t raise their heads.

At the same time, Roan tapped their shoulders as he brightly smiled.

“Work hard.”

With a word and an act, he cleanly split the hierarchy between himself and the students.

“Kuu.”

The brats, still with their heads lowered, couldn’t move without permission.

Roan averted his gaze and looked at Ian.

“Should we head to the location of the lecture?”

“Ah, yes. Follow me.”

Ian took hold of himself a second late and nodded his head.

Within that short moment, he understood the entire situation.

‘That’s why, you always have to be careful about what you say.’

Ian snickered and shook his head.

Soon, Roan and Ian disappeared from sight.

Only then did the students raise their heads and sigh.

“Huu.”

“To think that brat was Baron Tale.”

“Seriously. That rumor about a giant was a complete lie.”

Then, one of the brats spoke with a quiet voice.

“Maybe, could it be that his skills and exploits are also exaggerated?”

As soon as he spoke, the rest of the students clapped.

“That’s it!”

“That could be it!”

Quickly putting their heads together, the brats continued to quietly talk.

“Then, should we test if Roan’s skills are real?”

“Test? Us?”

At those words, the student who spoke first shook his head with an eerie expression.

“No. There’s that guy in our grade.”

“That guy? Ah! That guy!”

Promptly, the students’ faces brightened.

The brats looked at each other with a cruel light in their eyes.

“For now, let’s go convince that guy.”

A cold voice rolled down on the ground.

******

“It’s an honor to meet the hero of the expedition.”

“No. I’m more honored to have the chance to meet Sir Fred Brown, the principal leading the kingdom’s greatest academy.”

Holding the white-haired old man’s hand, Roan lowered his head.

The old man wearing a clean suit was Fred Brown, the one who was leading Tron Academy for the twentieth year.

‘He’s someone that I wanted to meet at least once.’

Roan was unimaginably moved.

It was a moment where a small goal from the last life had been achieved.

“If I could, I want to chat, but it seems that there isn’t much time left for the special lecture. Let us talk after the lecture is over.”

“Yes. Understood.”

That was what Roan wanted as well.

To him, who wanted to build an academy in the Tale Barony, a talk with Fred was a chance that could become the flesh and bones of his plan.

“Now, do follow me.”

Fred walked a step in front and Roan followed behind him.

Coming out of a simple office of the principal, they crossed the wooden hallway.

Passing through several buildings, they headed towards the garden behind the academy.

The location of the lecture was prepared in the open air instead of inside a building.

“Because there were too many students that wanted to audit, we prepared the place in the academy’s training field.”

Fred turned towards Roan and apologized.

Roan wordlessly nodded and gazed in front of him.

He could see a tall wall covered in vines.

There was an entrance at the center and several words were ornately written on top.

Tron Academy Training Field

The door was wide open.

Fred walked ahead and Roan followed behind.

Then.

Huuk!

Scorching heat was felt.

“Ah……”

Roan quietly exclaimed.

The field was enormous.

It was twice as large as the field where the Amaranth troop held drills.

Excluding one side, chairs filled the three sides of the field.

An unbelievable number.

Students sat in each and every one of those chairs.

It was an incredible number of students, but they didn’t let out a single sound.

They simply stared in curiosity while exuding heat from their entire bodies.

More than a thousand pair of eyes stabbed into Roan.

‘Are they trying to pressure me?’

Roan smiled bitterly inside.

Then, he heard Fred’s voice.

“It seems everyone has high expectations. For now, shall we go up onto the stage?”

“Yes.”

Roan replied shortly and followed Fred up the stage.

On the stage, there was a vertically long table and a loudspeaker made of a magic stone and a magic circle.

“We will now start the special lecture of Sir Baron Roan Tale, the hero of the Istel War and the monster expedition. Everyone please welcome him with a round of applause.”

As soon as he finished, claps sporadically resounded here and there.

A scene as if clapping against their will.

Fred furrowed his forehead at the sight, but didn’t criticize them.

‘It’s something Baron Tale will have to solve on his own.’

Truthfully, he wanted to see Roan’s ability.

Slightly lowering his head at Roan, Fred walked off the stage.

Now, only Roan was left on the tall stage.

He stood in front of the table and looked at the students.

‘Everyone’s expressions are ones saying let see how well I do.’

An undisguisable antagonism could be felt from their faces.

Of course, there were also students like Ian who showed signs of curiosity, desire, and respect.

‘Hm?’

Roan, who was scanning the students’ faces with Kalian’s Tear, frowned at the tip of his nose.

‘Royalty is also here.’

As expected of the kingdom’s greatest academy, he could see several princesses among the students.

And the one who stood out amongst them.

‘Princess Katy Rinse and……’

His eyes stayed in one place for a long time.

‘Princess Aily Rinse.’

For some reason, his ears felt hot and he became happy.

For a while, Roan motionlessly stared at her face.

“What the?”

“What’s up with him?”

Because Roan stayed silent for a long time, the students began to chatter.

Only then did Roan finally take ahold of himself.

‘It’s not the time for that.’

With a smiling face, he lowered his head.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Baron Roan Tale, who will be giving the special lecture today.

Even though he introduced himself, the field was silent.

“Woah!”

Only Ian cheered without worrying about others.

Roan slightly lowered his head toward Ian, and then made a faint smile.

“Hm.”

The students’ gazes pour down.

Calmly taking on those gazes, Roan spoke with a soft voice.

“The topic I want to talk about today is……”

Playfulness flashed in his eyes.

“About “what would you do if you knew about the future”.”

Chapter 110




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Good news and bad news: Sponsored chapter will be late, but it will be twice as long and will be released sometime around Wednesday or Thursday.

Truthfully, Roan was in a dilemma before the special lecture.

With the geniuses of Tron Academy as an audience, he had no idea what to talk about.

For topics like administration, etiquette, history, and philosophy, it was obvious that the students would know more than himself.

‘If it’s stories about wars and battles, I could talk on and on, but……’

With just that, neither the students nor Roan would learn anything from each other.

Roan wished that there was something that he could also learn from the special lecture.

At that moment, he suddenly thought up a topic called ‘What if you knew the future?’.

‘A debate disguised as a special lecture.’

Through the debate with the Tron Academy students, Roan planned on thinking up new and various methods to prepare for the future.

‘Of course, there are things I can teach as well.’

Stories that a soldier who experienced all sorts of battles and wars could tell.

That too, from the perspective of the students, could be a valuable experience.

With a calm gaze, Roan stared at the students.

“What did he just say?”

“If you knew the future……?”

“Is he asking us right now?”

Seemingly baffled at the unexpected lecture style, the students whispered amongst each other.

Paying no attention to that, Roan opened his arms.

“For now, let’s agree on a setting. You are fourth year students in Tron Academy facing graduation. Your house is a fallen nobility and you aren’t a student with great expectations placed upon you. But like I told you before, you know what will happen in the future.”

His mouth slowly curved upwards.

“You know that a year later, the Byron Kingdom will attempt a surprise attack and invade our kingdom’s northern borders.”

As the story went on, the students’ whispers became louder.

Roan spoke loudly as he walked on the stage.

“But our Rinse Kingdom is completely unprepared.”

Besides the time and the opponent, it was exactly the same setup as the war last year between Rinse Kingdom and Istel Kingdom.

Roan looked straight into the students’ eyes.

“In this situation, what would you do?”

The question was thrown.

Simultaneously, the whispers between the students stopped.

A strange silence pervaded.

Roan cheerfully smiled and shrugged.

“Isn’t Tron supposed to be the kingdom’s best academy? It seems that not everyone is as smart as the rumors say.”

A taunt.

The students’ faces burned red.

An odd heat flooded out.

At that moment, a male student suddenly stood up.

“I’m Tron Academy’s knight school third year Charles Linkamp. Wouldn’t informing the palace or the central military headquarter, or at least the northern troops headquarters resolve the issue?”

Several students nodded as if they agreed with the suggestion.

On the other hand, Roan’s expression was unsatisfied.

“Would such highly esteemed people trust a mere academy student’s words?”

“That, that is……”

Charles couldn’t easily continue his words, and soon sat down.

Then, an irritated voice came out from somewhere.

“I don’t even need to think so hard about this problem. I can just tell my dad.”

Roan turned his line of sight toward the voice.

A delicate looking young man had an arrogant expression.

“Could you tell us your name?”

At those words, the young man pompously smiled and spoke aloud.

“Kyle Chase. I… I’m the second son of Count Chase’s house.”

The young man was the second son of Count Jonathan Chase and was repeating the Tron Academy’s administration school as a third year student.

Roan faintly smiled and shook his head.

“We have agreed on the setting before we began. You are a fourth year student facing graduation from Tron Academy, your house is a fallen nobility, and you don’t have large expectations placed upon you. In this setting, your father isn’t Sir Count Chase.”

“No that’s……”

Kyle momentarily hesitated and soon blushed.

Then, another student spoke with an irritated expression.

“What could a mere student from a fallen nobility who others don’t expect much of, do?”

Other students also frowned their foreheads and nodded.

“Yeah. However much we think about it, there’s really nothing we can do.”

One of the students asked to Roan.

“If it’s Sir Baron, what would you do?”

Everyone’s gazes turned toward Roan.

Roan cheerfully smiled as he replied.

“Who knows? How about applying for the Northern troops? In the Northern troops, we’ll raise merits while carrying out missions and find the signs that the Byron Kingdom’s troops are acting suspiciously. If we have evidences, even the military head generals wouldn’t be able to easily ignore us.”

This was actually the method Roan used before the war with Istel Kingdom.

At that moment, a student raised his hand.

“I’m Tron Academy’s administration school fourth year Justin Buford. The method you said is only possible for knight school graduates.”

Roan nodded at those words.

“You’re right. Certainly, that is so.”

“Then what should others like us from the administration school do?”

Justin’s eyes shone with passion.

Meaning he didn’t want an answer despite throwing the question.

Roan didn’t miss that.

“Who knows? Do you have any good idea?”

He returned the question.

A strange smile formed on Justin’s mouth.

Standing straight by himself, he showed off his thoughts with a confident voice.

“To start, I too would volunteer for the Northern troops. Then, while cutting down vague expenditures of military supplies and provisions and increasing the savings, I would repair the old defense facilities. At the same time, I would repair the roads and start a periodic military training for the locals……”

A well thought-out presentation continued on for a while.

Students unknowingly attentively listened to Justin’s story.

‘He’s a smart student.’

Roan inwardly smiled.

By that point, Justin’s presentation ended.

“With this much, I predict that we would be able to adequately respond to a sudden invasion.”

“Umm.”

A low murmur flowed out from here and there.

Roan lightly clapped and nodded.

“It’s an excellent plan. But would someone leave such a large job to a newbie administrator who just graduated from the academy?”

“That’s……”

When Justin tried to answer.

A young man suddenly stood up from his sit.

“We can start as a low rank administrator at the military supply storage. If we can simply fix the loans and lease in the ledger, we should be able to reduce the unnecessary leaks in the military supplies.”

Justin continued the later part.

“He’s right. If we can efficiently oversee the military supplies, wouldn’t we be recognized by the troop commander and receive more important missions?”

That was the start.

Soon, various suggestions poured out from here and there.

“You can’t move up simply by doing well in missions.”

“Yeah. It’s much more complicated in reality.”

“Rather, wouldn’t finding out the reasons why the Byron Kingdom is invading us be better?”

“That’s right. If we can resolve that reason, we could stop an unnecessary war.”

“What if there isn’t a reason? Then we’ll end up wasting an entire year.”

Now, there wasn’t any need for Roan to cut in.

By themselves, the students opened up a heated debate.

Students from the administration school, the education school,and the school of magic started first and later on, even the knight school and the military school students participated.

The debate went on and on without an end.

Roan only lightly stepped in from time to time to pause when the passionate discussion become too heated, and simply stood and watched for the most part.

“This is quite a new sight.”

“You’re right. It’s the first time I’m seeing such a heated debate.”

“Anyhow, everyone is quite smart.”

“I never knew there were such diverse plans and thoughts.”

Even the Tron Academy professors seemed to be surprised at the students’ heated debate.

Principal Fred Brown, who had been watching from the side, made a faint smile.

“We should add this style of class into the main education course.”

Many professors nodded at those words.

All the while, the heated debate ran into a dead end.

Several hundreds of students shared their suggestions, but no clear answer appeared.

In the end, Justin raised his hand.

“Sir Baron. At this rate, this will never end. Please tell us what is the correct answer.”

“Yeah. Just what’s the correct answer?”

“What should we do?”

The students clamored with exasperated expressions.

Roan motionlessly watched them for a moment and then raised his hands to calm down the mood.

Smiling brightly, he looked at the students.

“The answer has already came out.”

At those words, the students looked at each other and clamored.

That was same for the principal and the professors.

“What? What was the answer?”

“Then as expected, is applying for the Northern troops like Baron Tale suggested the answer?”

“But that’s only possible for knight school graduates.”

The clamor slowly became bigger and bigger.

Roan raised his hand once again to calmed the mood.

“The answer to this topic is……”

Gulp.

Everyone made a dry gulp.

Feeling their gazes pouring down, Roan calmly continued his words.

“Every suggestions that came out until now.”

Suddenly, the students and the professors made aghast expressions.

Soul-less expressions.

Roan continued to talk without minding them.

“There is no right answer to this topic. However, there are countless and diverse answers that exist.”

He pointed at the students.

“The methods that everyone suggested are those answers.”

The silence went on.

“No way……”

Some students murmured with quiet voices.

Soon, shouts mixed with annoyance echoed.

“All the suggestions we put out are the answers?”

“Are you saying there’s no correct answer?”

“Then, why would we even have this debate?”

“Did we just waste our time?”

Roan shook his head at those words.

He slowly moved his foot and stood in front of the desk.

From this point on was the story that Roan wanted to tell.

“Everyone. If you knew the future, did you feel like you could do anything, and accomplish anything? But when we actually debated, you should have realized that there’s lot less that you can do than you first thought. Instead, you would also be scared. Because if you can’t respond correctly, you or the people important to you could die.”

The clamoring students closed their mouths.

They carefully listened to Roan’s story.

“Knowing the future; it’s not as difficult as you think. What’s the reason that everyone is studying hard for four years in the academy? To earn wealth? For power? Honor? In the end, it’s for the future. Smart friends and those who studied diligently should know. What kind of crops and minerals would become valuable, or perhaps where the kingdom’s current political power is and where it’s going. You should be able to predict and judge those things.”

Several students nodded their head.

Roan’s words continued.

“In the end, the only difference is how much certainty you have, and is not very different from knowing the future. I’ll ask everyone again. A year from now, the price of wheat will skyrocket. What will you do?”

The students didn’t quickly answer and raised countless plans again and again.

Looking at the twinkling light in their eyes, Roan faintly smiled.

“What everyone is thinking of right now are the answers to preparing for the future. But that’s not the everything.”

With a finger, he pointed toward his head.

“The world isn’t inside the head. The world is……”

The finger pointing at the head pointed towards the sky.

“Outside.”

A strength set in his voice.

“Don’t just think, but personally act. You already have plenty of answers. Now, it is time……”

A smile hanged in Roan’s mouth.

“To prove the answer.”

With this, the lecture was over.

The story Roan wanted to tell the students.

That is to say that they should personally move, act, face, and experience.

There were many smart people.

If we included the people who think they are smart, that number goes up even more.

But in reality, there were only a few people who left their names in history.

‘If you simply think of walking and don’t actually walk……’

Roan’s eyes flashed with light.

‘No footsteps will remain.’

Even if one failed and despaired, the footsteps he left behind would become a sign.

‘If you walk on and on, you’ll arrive at your goal.’

Just like that, Roan was tirelessly walking forward right now.

He wasn’t simply thinking and planning, but actually walking.

He wished that the Tron Academy’s students too would become people who diligently walked forward.

‘I’m not sure if they understood my message.’

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

He wasn’t sure about the students, but there were many things he got from the special lecture.

‘Among the many methods the students suggested, there were quite a lot worth using.’

The bold and radical methods that most nobles would likely avoid.

Roan planned on refining them.

“Then with this, I’ll end the special lecture.”

He walked to the side of the desk and bowed.

The students still looked to be deep in thought.

At that sight, Roan faintly smiled.

At that moment.

“Sir Baron Tale.”

Among the students, a powerfully built young man stood up.

He was quite a handsome young man, but his face was filled with a tired expression.

“I’m Tron Academy’s knight school fourth year Brian Miles.”

Suddenly, a shocked look appeared on Roan’s face.

‘Brian Miles?’

A name he had forgotten until now.

But it was a name that one would have heard of at least once if one was a kingdom’s knight or a soldier.

At least, it was like that in the last life.

Especially to Roan who was Pierce’s friend, he was someone that left a strong impression.

He looked straight into Brian’s eyes.

‘Brian Miles.’

His heart rapidly beated.

‘The unfortunate genius.’

*****

Boom!

From deep in the mountains, an explosion suddenly sounded.

Kugugugung.

Giant trees fell down and a mountainside collapsed.

Keuheoheoheong.

And following that, a monster’s scream echoed.

Bang!

Again, an explosion rang out.

The monster’s scream, as if it was a lie, wasn’t heard anymore.

Instead.

“Oi! I told you to control your strength. Your mana handling is still rough!”

An angry roar loudly echoed.

And then.

“Master. That’s not as easy as it sounds.”

A moody voice rang out.

Soon, the fallen tree was moved aside and a middle-aged man and a young man showed up.

Both of their hairs and beards were long.

The young man sat down on the tree and sighed.

“Huu.”

At that sight, the middle-aged man frowned.

“Why a sigh all of a sudden?”

A voice that was somehow humorous.

Puk!

Instead of an answer, the young man planted the spear in his right hand by his foot.

The middle-aged man snickered and glanced.

“Why? You want to go down?”

At those words, the young man once again sighed.

“Huu. It’s already been a year since we entered the Grain Mountains. Isn’t it about time we go back down?”

“And you’re satisfied with your skill?”

The middle-aged man threw out a question instead of an answer.

The young man wasn’t able to say anything.

The middle-aged man’s words continued.

“Even if you go down now, you’ll still have your name flaunted as one of the top spearman in the kingdom. But that’s all. If Roan is acting with the continent as his stage, then you’ll only be a so-so friend.”

Roan. The name Roan came out of the middle-aged man’s mouth.

“I heard you made a promise Roan. That you’ll become the continent’s best spearman.”

The final blow.

The young man, who had his head down, suddenly stood up.

Grabbing the spear by his foot, he looked at the middle-aged man.

“Master. Let’s go somewhere deeper.”

At those words, the middle aged man brightly smiled.

“That’s it. Now you’re acting like Pierce.”

Pierce.

The young man’s identity was Pierce.

And the middle-aged man that was harshly driving that Pierce was Reil Baker, the man known as a genius of the spear.

For their spear training, the two had entered the Grain Mountains.

Thanks to that, they had completely no idea what was happening to the Rinse Kingdom and Roan.

They simply focused again and again on training.

Reil put his arm around Pierce and made a wild face.

“Then. Shall we go somewhere deeper?”

Pierce smiled bitterly at those words.

But his footsteps were already heading deep into the Grain Mountains.

‘Sir Adjutant Roan. Just a little longer, please wait just a little longer.’

His loyalty was the same.

No, his loyalty became deeper as the time he spent away became longer.

Soon, Pierce and Reil disappeared.

Boom!

Once again, an explosion rang out.

And.

“Hey! I told you to control your strength!”

Reil’s voice followed.

Chapter 111




Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter. I’m sorry about being too late. Also, thank you very much for supporting I am the Monarch.

The greatest spearman of the continent.

The greatest genius of the continent.

There were many nicknames attributed to Pierce.

But before Pierce, there was a swordsman that held the nickname as a genius.

His name was Brian Miles.

As the firstborn of Viscount Miles’s house, Brian showed exceptional talent in swordsmanship and achieved the level of an elementary swordsman before he attended the academy.

For Brian, who may become the kingdom’s first swordmaster, the Rinse royalty provided advanced swordsmanship and mana techniques, as well as various herbs known to increase the understanding of mana.

Possibly thanks to this total support, Brian achieved the pinnacle of swordsmanship within the first year of Tron Academy.

The expectations, that the Rinse Kingdom’s first swordmaster may be born at this rate, bubbled.

But.

‘He stopped just there.’

Roan made a short sigh.

The reason Brian was called the unfortunate genius.

For some reason, Brian’s growth stopped in his second year at the academy.

Although achieving the pinnacle of swordsmanship at the age of seventeen was an amazing achievement, to Brian who looked towards a greater height, the inexplicable halt in his growth was a torment.

‘Little by little, he slowly crumbled and……’

Ultimately with the appearance of Pierce, another genius, no, a genius on a different level, he completely collapsed.

In the end, the genius who received the Kingdom’s expectations to become the first swordmaster ended his own life at the young age of twenty eight.

‘Is it the second year after the halt?’

Roan looked at Brian.

A face full of fatigue.

‘It seems he’s already began to burn out.’

He needlessly felt pity for him.

Then.

“Thank you for the special lecture. It was an interesting topic. But doesn’t Sir Baron Tale’s real worth lie as a warrior who commands battlefields? I heard that your spearmanship is incredible.”

“The rumors tend to be exaggerated.”

Roan smiled.

Still with a weary look, Brian spoke.

“Please have a duel with me.”

He deeply bowed from his waist.

A very polite and respectful attitude.

And to Roan who knew his future, he felt some desperation from that sight.

‘He’s probably looking for a breakthrough.’

Roan deeply inhaled.

‘Perhaps, this duel could help him.’

An event that happened to neither Roan nor Brian in the last life.

“Sure. Let’s have a duel.”

Soon as he finished his words, Brian raised his head.

A crack appeared in his worn-out expression.

Although very slightly, his joy could be felt.

On the side, several students pumped their fists in delight.

They were the brats who ridiculed Roan when he had first entered the Tron Academy.

‘It’s the work of those brats.’

A bitter smile formed.

‘Most likely, they babbled something about possibly feeling something if he fought with a warrior who fought in real battles.’

And Brian likely agreed feeling like grabbing at straws.

But either way, it was true that he himself wanted to help Brian.

If this event went well, the Rinse Kingdom’s first swordmaster may be born.

‘He could be a good rival for Pierce too.’

For course, he would have like to keep him by his side and use him if there was a chance.

“Wow! This is big!”

“A duel between the expedition’s hero, Sir Baron Roan Tale, and our academy’s best swordsman, Brian!”

“Who do you think will win?”

“Even if Sir Baron Tale has incredible spearmanship, Brian’s mana control should be much better.”

“Eey. It’s a duel, a duel. Use of mana isn’t allowed in a duel. They will be fighting purely with swordsmanship and spearmanship.”

The students became greatly excited at the suddenly decided duel.

Without minding the reactions around him, Brian walked towards the stage.

“Brian! Brian!”

The students chanted Brian’s name.

“This is completely unexpected.”

Principal Fred Brown, who was watching the events from the side, made a difficult expression.

Soon, he turned his head toward Professor Rambel Valley from the knight school.

“Professor Valley. Please prepare the duel.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Rambel quickly nodded his head and stood up.

Quickly, he sent several students to training field’s shed to bring the weapons and armors for training.

The table on top of the stage was moved aside and an arena was soon prepared.

The academy’s professors, including Fred, made a peculiar expression.

‘I should be able to see those rumored skills.’

‘If Brian can take a complete victory, he could pull back the interests that were waning until now.’

All the while, Roan and Brian stared at each other on top of the stage.

“Thank you for accepting the duel.”

Brian deeply lowered his head.

Roan faintly smiled as he shook his head.

“It will be a good lesson for me as well.”

A meeting between the young geniuses that will lead the Rinse Kingdom.

Just that made this duel worthy enough.

Amongst several wooden swords, Brian picked one up.

“Sir Baron Tale.”

“Yes. What is it?”

Roan, who likewise was choosing a wooden pole, looked at Brian.

“Since we will be having a duel, why don’t we have a real duel?”

“Hhm.”

Roan slightly frowned.

There was a big difference between a regular duel and a real duel.

If a regular duel was like training where the two compared their skills and matched their moves, a real duel was more like a fight that always ends with a clear winner and loser.

The only difference simply being the use of edgeless weapons, it was a duel where one’s life could be in danger with a small mistake.

“Is that truly necessary?”

Brian awkwardly smiled at those words and replied.

“I want to feel the true spearmanship as it is. The spearmanship……”

A strength went into the light in his eyes.

“That Sir Baron Tale used on top of the battlefields.”

A polite yet desperate voice.

In truth, Brian had already dueled with countless knights.

But even so, his growth remained stalled, and he felt an unknown need.

A thirst like a burning throat.

‘If I fight against skills from real fights, wouldn’t something be different?’

There was such an expectation.

Because of that, he requested a duel to Roan despite knowing that his juniors’ temptations were simply immature.

Brian stared straight into Roan’s two eyes.

Feeling that stare, Roan exhaled a short sigh.

‘It seems he is quite frustrated.’

He slowly nodded his head.

“Sure. Let’s have a real duel.”

“Thank you very much.”

Brian lowered his head once again.

Swinging a wooden sword around, he stretched his body.

On the other hand, Roan, who had been choosing a wooden pole, walked up to the leather armors.

“Un? Armor?”

“Is he actually going to wear armor when they are having a duel?”

“Is he perhaps afraid of getting hit by a wooden sword?”

The students clamored.

That was the same for the professors.

Most of all, the knight school professors squinted their foreheads and criticized.

“Armor despite having a duel. This is a first.”

“Yes. Sir Baron Tale isn’t being manly at all. To wear armor in a duel with a student.”

“That’s not chivalry. As expected of someone from a common soldier background.”

Principal Fred Brown, who was quietly listening, shook his head.

“It’s a real duel. It isn’t a problem whether he wears armor or not.”

“But, but there’s no knight who actually does that.”

The knight school professor shouted in protest.

Fred shook his head.

Somehow, a sigh leaked out.

‘Huu. Those knights’ empty rituals…… cht. They’re people who’ll search for courtesy even when life is in danger.’

Fred, who originally was from a civil official background, became speechless at the knights’ stubbornness and useless courtesy.

All the while, the clamor slowly became louder.

But without minding it, Roan scrupulously put on the leather armor.

Not only that, Roan didn’t forget about leather gauntlets and helmet and put them on.

‘It’s looser than I thought.’

After swinging his wooden pole several times, Roan once again tied the armor’s strings.

Lightly jumping and bowing his back, he carefully checked if there was anything uncomfortable.

“Are you wearing leather armor in a duel?”

Roan smiled at Brian’s words.

“Because it’s a real duel.”

Tapping his leather armor, he continued his words.

“In real fight, protection is a must.”

“Hmm.”

Brian quietly sighed.

For him who received the knight school’s teachings, it was something hard to understand.

‘Doesn’t he feel that it’s cowardly and dishonorable?’

The traditional thought pattern of knights.

At such Brian, Roan inwardly shook his head.

‘This era’s knights, especially the students, were focused on useless and empty rituals and looks.’

A real duel was the same as a real fight.

Not properly wearing protection in a situation where life could come and go was reckless.

‘Pierce and Brian’s difference. Perhaps that was the difference between experience in real fight and one’s mindset.’

Pierce began as a common soldier running on the battlefields and fought on the frontlines and raised merits even after becoming Reil Baker’s student.

On the other hand, Brian entered the academy and received training in swordsmanship and trained as a royal knight after graduating.

‘If my guess is right……’

A faint smile hung on Roan’s mouth.

‘I should show exactly what a real fight is like.’

He planned to change that mindset immersed in empty rituals.

After a short bow, Roan and Brian took their distance.

The wooden pole and sword pointed at each other.

The preparation for the duel was finished.

“Ready!”

Rambel raised his right hand.

Suddenly, the light in Roan’s eyes changed.

Within the calm eyes, a fire sparked.

At the same time, a breathtaking pressure exuded from his entire body.

That was a chill and a killing intent that brought a razor-edged blade to mind.

‘Hph!’

Rambel, who was about to announce the duel’s start, nervously swallowed.

The hairs on his body stood up and a cold sweat ran down.

But comparably, his situation was better.

Brian, who was facing Roan, momentarily couldn’t breath.

‘Mana? No. This is aura.’

This kind of experience was a first.

‘Is this what a real warrior who walks the battlefields look like?’

His eyes sharply trembled.

On the other hand, the professors and the students away from the stage didn’t notice the change.

The ones who could feel Roan’s breathtaking killing intent and pressure were only Brian and Rambel.

Gulp.

Brian swallowed with his dry mouth.

Somehow, his heart thumped.

‘This. This is what I wanted.’

Strength went into the hand holding the wooden sword.

A strange silence continued.

But the students who didn’t know what was happening on the stage tilted their heads and complained.

“What? Why aren’t they starting?”

“What happened?”

“What’s going on?”

The clamor slowly became louder.

Only then, Rambel took hold of himself a step late and roared.

“Begin!”

At the same time, he escaped to a corner of the stage.

Even he, who was the knight school’s professor, had hard time taking on Roan’s pressure.

‘He’s like someone who has only been on battlefields for decades.’

It just wasn’t a pressure that matched Roan’s age.

At that moment, the students’ cheers exploded.

“Waaaaa!”

They became feverishly excited when the duel began.

Feeling the heat from the students, Brian slightly bent his knees.

“‘I’ll attack fir…….’

He aimed for the first strike.

But the one who moved first was Roan.

Tat!

Roan kicked the floor and threw his body toward Brian.

The tip of the pole sharply shook and cut the space.

Brian quickly moved outside of the pole’s range.

‘Good.’

In that brief moment he relaxed.

The length of Roan’s pole suddenly extended.

In that short moment, he had kicked the ground once again.

‘Hph!’

Swallowing empty air, Brian twisted his body.

Pat!

The tip of the pole scratched his side and passed.

‘Certainly, there’s no waste.’

With a single strike, Brian realized that Roan’s spearmanship was extremely efficient.

‘Is this the real spearmanship? Then I’lll……’

Rubbing his foot against the ground, he turned his body.

The tip of the sword cut through the space and danced.

‘This is the royalty and nobles’ advanced swordsmanship!’

It was the strongest swordsmanship made from the core and the quintessence of the kingdom’s best swordsmanship.

To create this, the royal knights as well as all the powerful warriors and scholars gathered their strengths together.

Pat!

The sword dizzily moved and drew a complex path.

‘Hmm.’

At the sight of the sword that looked like it would immediately break his entire body, Roan clenched his teeth.

Zing.

Kalian’s Tears activated.

Suddenly, the movement of Brian’s sword as well as the entire world slowed down.

‘It’s certainly a fancy swordsmanship.’

Looking at the sword’s trajectory that seemed like there was nowhere to run from, Roan clicked his tongue.

Quickly, he swung his pole and stabbed into the node of the sword’s trajectory.

Tung!

With a clean sound of impact, the sword bounced off.

‘Heavy.’

Roan was shocked at the heavy weight that was felt along with the impact.

Brian’s sword wasn’t simply fancy.

‘It seems he wasn’t called a genius for nothing.’

Roan too would had a hard time winning without the Kalian’s Tears.

On the other hand, Brian was greatly surprised as well.

‘He cut the sword’s movement with a single strike?’

He pushed exactly into the link between his sword movements.

This had never happened even once before.

‘The rumors were actually lacking.’

Biting his lips, Brian twisted his shoulder.

The sword that bounced off, twisted once and headed toward Roan once again.

Tang! Tudung! Tung! Tung!

Along with the sound of impact, a fierce battle ensued.

Actively using Kalian’s Tears, Roan easily blocked Brian’s ferocious attacks.

Perhaps because of that, Brian’s movement became more and more aggressive.

No, to be exact, he became more excited.

Even though he attacked from whichever direction, whatever technique, and with varying strength, Roan blocked them with unbelievable ease.

Thanks to that, he could bring out all the swordsmanship and techniques he knew as much as he wanted.

‘This is a first.’

Until now, all the duels couldn’t pass fifty bouts.

Within fifty bouts, either his opponent or he himself lost.

Thanks to that, he didn’t have any memory of swinging the sword as much as he wished.

But now, it was different.

‘If it’s now, I think I can bring out everything I know.’

He naturally became exhilarated.

Forgetting that this was a real duel, he purely focused his mind on the tip of his sword.

Ssk!

As his focus reached the peak, his mana unknowingly flew down the sword.

Pat!

A bluish mana faintly shined along the edge.

‘Hm!’

Roan, who had been easily bouncing off the sword, frowned at the sudden change.

He tried to step back and push away, but Brian furiously attacked instead.

‘Can’t be helped.’

Shaking his head inwardly, Roan used the Flamdor mana technique.

From the mana hole, a calm and powerful strength flew out.

Pat!

Along the pole, a clear light of mana took place.

Tang! Tadang! Tang!

Even the sounds of the impact changed.

A sharp sound hit his ears.

‘Kuuk!’

Roan clenched his teeth.

A stinging feeling on his hands.

As Brian began to actively use mana, it became hard to take him on.

Certainly, if they only compared their mastery of mana techniques, Brian was a step or two ahead.

‘But even so, I can’t simply back off like this.’

Roan poured mana into the Kalian’s Tears.

Suddenly.

Pat!

The entire world was colored in a golden light.

‘Hm. So that’s how he’s using the mana.’

Looking at the mana swirling in Brian’s body and the sword, Roan smiled.

Just by understanding the flow of mana, he could predict when and how Brian’s attack will come.

‘Un?’

At that moment, Roan’s eyes caught a strange flow.

The mana that was smoothly flowing in Brian’s body momentarily twitched and bounced off everywhere as if it hit a wall.

The bounced off mana soon collected together as one, and followed the mana road down the sword.

‘What?’

An extremely short moment.

It suddenly and momentarily happened.

Without Kalian’s Tears, he wouldn’t have been able to notice.

Then.

Pat!

The sword passed by his ears.

But Roan, to whom the entire world’s movement felt slow enough to yawn, easily dodged.

“Uak!”

“Did you see that?”

“I thought his head was going to break apart from the sword!”

The students, who were watching, shouted out in surprise.

This was the same for the professors.

“Did he use mana just now?”

“To use mana in a duel! It’s too dangerous.”

The ruckus was loud.

But on the other hand, Fred was calm.

‘Did I ever see Brian be that passionate?’

He didn’t.

Especially recently, Brian always looked tired.

‘For now, let’s wait and see.’

Fred shook his hand toward the professors to calm them down.

“If the situation becomes dangerous, let’s step in at that moment.”

At those words, the professors tried to mumble and say something, but soon nodded.

All the while, Roan and Brian’s fight become even more fierce.

And as it went on, Brian’s focus reached its height.

Now in his eyes, even Roan wasn’t seen.

The only thing that was seen was the end of his sword.

‘Just a bit more! Just a bit more!’

If this went on just a little bit more, he felt that he could break through his stagnation.

Below the extremely high concentration, a sweet expectation slowly arose.

That was the problem.

The desire took hold of Brian’s concentration and shook it.

‘Just a bit more!!!!!!!’

In that one moment, Brian’s movement changed.

The fierce yet stable movement changed to a raw madness.

The one who realized this change first was Roan.

‘His emotion quivered!’

Blocking the attacks that fell like a storm, Roan stepped back.

The mana inside Brian’s body jumped as if insane.

‘If this goes on, his mana will overflow!’

Becoming crippled was certain, and he could lose even his life if not careful.

Roan put strength into his hands holding the pole.

But he couldn’t carelessly attack.

‘Killing him would be much easier, but……’

Suppressing him was a problem.

At that moment.

‘Un? Again?’

The mana inside Brian once again bounced off everywhere as if it was blocked.

‘It’s an extremely short instance, but Brian’s movements become unnatural whenever the mana bounced off.’

Bouncing off the attacks that rained down, Roan raised his focus.

Waiting for the moment the mana inside Brian bounced off.

Thankfully, once Brian lost his consciousness and rioted, that instance became more common.

Tung!

Once again, the mana inside Brian bounced out.

‘Now!’

Dizzily moving his two feet, Roan twisted his pole.

Pat!

Cutting through the space, the pole’s tip hit Brian’s chest.

Truly a lightning-like attack.

Brian, who was in middle of an attack, couldn’t dodge or block.

Puck!

“Kuuk!”

Lowering his left shoulder, Brian felt pain.

Roan turned his body just like that and swung his pole.

Puck!

The pole powerfully hit Brian’s left side.

“Kuk!”

Grabbing his side, Brian stepped back.

But the light in his eyes was still ferocious, and the mana inside his body, as expected, was jumping as if insane.

‘Just a bit, just a bit more!!!!!’

While exuding a mad aura, Brian charged towards Roan.

‘Poor kid.’

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

From Brian, he could feel the incredible pressure and weight a genius must carry.

‘He must’ve been desperate to live up to the others’ expectations.’

That desperation must have led to this rampage.

Roan squinted his eyes at the sword that was cutting through the air and about to halve his face.

Ssk.

Brian’s sword almost touched Roan’s nose and closely passed by.

A perfect calculation of distance.

Ptt!

But even though it didn’t touch, the nose was cut and the blood flew.

It was because of the mana.

“Uuhuk!”

“Uwah!”

Cries exploded amongst the students.

Roan slightly squinted his eyes, but didn’t pause or hesitate.

Tat!

Stomping down on the sword that slid down, he jumped toward Brian’s chest.

“Un?”

“Eh?”

“A spearman attempting close combat?”

The students as well as the professors had confused expressions.

On the other hand, Roan’s expression was clam.

He pushed his body below Brian’s right arm.

Spt!

As if swinging around a tree, Roan turned to Brian’s back.

At the same time, he wrapped Brian’s arm and neck with his right arm and grabbed his right shoulder with his left arm.

A perfect choke.

“Kuhuk.”

Suffocated, Brian made a painful gasp.

He struggled to push Roan off, but Roan moved closer instead.

‘This is the choke hold of the Reid battle technique.’

Roan poured mana into his two arms.

The muscles expanded tautly.

In the end, Brian couldn’t take it despite struggling and fell on his back.

“Kuhuk. Kuk!”

Brian drooled as his eyes flipped.

Word for word the very moment before fainting.

All the strength in his body went out.

“Huu.”

Only then did Roan let go of his choke hold.

“Keek! Keek!”

Brian breathed roughly as he coughed.

Roan stood up from the stop and fixed the loose armor.

Of course, his eyes were on Brian.

‘For now, the mana is just about stable…… un?’

When he thought up to that point.

Brian’s mana that was calming down bounced off here and there within his body, and once again began to boil.

“Kuluk!”

Coughing deeply once more, Brian stood up.

His lips shined with a bloody light.

“It’s not over yet.”

He spoke with a common tone, but madness could be felt.

Brian was still on a rampage.

‘What a pain.’

Roan creased his forehead.

At that moment.

Ssun!

Brian gathered all of the mana inside his body.

Zzk.

The wooden sword couldn’t hold on and cracks appeared here and there.

“Uuaaaahh!”

With a horrible shriek, Brian kicked the ground.

He planned to put his all into this final strike.

It certainly wasn’t a good plan.

‘He’ll be crippled if this goes on!’

Roan quickly took up his wooden pole.

He observed the stream of mana inside Brian running toward him.

‘Just once more! Let the stream stop just once more!’

There was only one way to stop the rampage.

Stabbing in his own mana the very moment when Brian’s mana momentarily bounce out.

If not careful, Brian’s entire mana could be lost, but it was better than becoming crippled or dead.

‘Just once, just once.’

Holding the pole, Roan squinted at the stream of mana inside Brian’s body.

By then, Brian was already right in front of him.

If not careful, his head could be broken apart by a wooden sword full of mana.

Gulp.

Dry spit was swallowed naturally and a cold sweat ran down his forehead.

‘Should I dodge?’

A critical moment.

Then.

Tung.

The mana inside Brian bounced out in every direction.

Flinch.

Brian himself didn’t notice, but the tip of his sword faintly shook.

‘Now!’

Stepping forward with his left foot, Roan quickly lunged with his pole.

Boom!

Straight on.

With a blast, the left foot crashed into the stage.

The wooden pole cut and flew through space and hit the tip of Brian’s wooden sword.

BOOM!

A blast rang out once again.

Brian’s wooden sword exploded out everywhere.

Because the mana’s stream was momentarily cut off, it couldn’t take on Roan’s attack.

Just like that, Roan pushed the pole forward.

Puk!

The tip of the pole stabbed Brian’s stomach.

At the same time, a string of mana entered his body.

Paat!

Roan’s mana tore through Brian’s mana road.

Thanks to that, Brian’s mana that momentarily blasted out couldn’t clump again and returned to the mana hole.

“Kuhuk!”

Grabbing at his chest, Brian fell down just like that.

Kung.

A kneeling posture.

“Kuluk! Kuk.”

He threw up several dry coughs.

Putting away the pole, Roan looked inside of Brian’s body.

‘Huh. Thankfully, it seems to have calmed down.’

He leaked a sigh of relief.

Roan’s mana that tore through Brian’s body was also naturally dissipating.

Puk!

Roan planted the wooden pole next to his foot.

“Kuluk!”

Brian, who was continuing to cough, turned to Roan with a troubled face.

The madness that had filled his face was completely gone.

“I, I’m sorry.”

Brian knew well what he had done.

He quickly lowered his head.

Looking at that sight, Roan made a faint smile.

“Student Miles. I think……”

A gentle voice.

“You shouldn’t use that mana technique.”

He couldn’t be sure, but Brian’s stagnation in his growth was probably due to that damned mana technique that the kingdom’s geniuses made.

‘The mana inside his body didn’t flow naturally and was bouncing off bit by bit. It definitely isn’t something natural.’

Because they inputted this and that and everything known to be good, it resulted in an unexpected problem.

“And……”

Roan tapped his armor.

“Next time, please wear an armor. The basics are always important.”

Exhaling a long sigh, he stepped back.

Somehow, he didn’t feel quite satisfied.

‘I feel like I helped him, but why do I feel iffy?’

He shook his head and looked toward the students.

The students were shocked half out of their minds at Roan’s win.

That was the same for the professors.

The breathless silence continued.

In the end, Roan awkwardly smiled and open his mouth.

“The duel is over.”

Only then, quiet exclamations sounded here and there.

“Ah!”

“Woaaah…….”

The exclamations soon turned to cheers.

“Woaaaahh!”

“Amazing!”

“What, what was that last move?”

“What about that choke from before!”

The sound of claps poured down.

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

“Roan! Roan!”

Roan cheerfully smiled and waved his hand.

‘Is it finally over……’

The day felt too long.

Roan lightly bowed toward Rambel, who was standing off at the edge of the stage, and moved his feet.

eet.

Then.

“Sir, Sir Baron Tale!”

He heard Brian’s voice.

Roan simply stood at the end of the stage and turned his head to look at him.

Brian was still kneeling.

His face somehow looked relieved yet empty.

“I have a request.”

A powerful voice.

At the same time, it was a desperate voice.

Brian planted his two hands on the floor.

He looked straight into Roan’s two eyes and continued his words.

“Please take me with you!”

Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter. Thank you very much for your support. And please don’t give any donations next week. I got exams and papers coming up.

Confusion.

That was the first thing Roan felt.

No, to be exact, that was the first thing everyone in the training field felt.

“Just now, what did you……”

Before Roan could even finish his words.

“Please take me with you. I want to learn more by your side.”

Brian shouted at the top of his lungs.

He didn’t care about the gazes from the academy’s professors as well as his classmates and juniors.

‘I’m not embarrassed at all.’

Brian was sincere.

He was certain.

That he must follow Roan to escape the stagnation in his growth.

On the other hand, Roan was simply confused.

‘I do want to keep him by my side and use him, but……’

He definitely didn’t expect that Brian would approach him like this.

Roan awkwardly smiled and shook his hand.

“Even if you say something like that right now…….”

When he spoke that far.

“Since he’s that desperate, why don’t you just take him?”

A sharp voice was heard.

Roan, as well as everyone else’s gazes, turned and searched for the owner of the voice.

‘Princess Katy Rinse.’

The owner of the voice was Katy.

With her arms crossed, she had on a strange smile.

“You might not know much about things in the capital, but Brian is a genius amongst geniuses that the entire kingdom is paying attention to.”

“Yes, I know.”

Roan lightly answered back.

With an expression that seemed to ask what the problem was, Katy continued to talk.

“Then what’s the worry? The kingdom’s best genius is even kneeling and asking you to take him. Just take him with you.”

At those words, Roan replied in a calm and composed voice.

“Brian Miles is still a student. For now, he must graduate from the academy first. Then……’

His line of sight turned toward Brian.

“As princess said, the student Brian Miles is a genius that the entire kingdom is looking at. From the standpoint of the royal family, they wouldn’t look kindly upon such a genius going to a rural barony instead of the royal knight order.”

Several students and the professors nodded.

Particularly, some knight school professors strongly concurred.

‘A mere barony is absolutely out of the question!’

The amount of resources and interest that the royal family has poured into Brian was colossal.

And it was difficult to imagine him going to the Tale Barony, where its owner had just become a noble, instead of the royal knight order.

At that moment.

“Sir Baron Tale!”

He heard Brian’s voice.

He spoke with a desperate voice.

“If you leave me here just like this, I may just die.”

A threat.

No, the voice was too desperate to call it a threat.

Brian thought that this was the last chance.

With blood-boiling feeling in his heart, he continued to speak.

“It has been two years since I stopped growing for an inexplicable reason. I trained and trained while even cutting down on sleep, but there wasn’t a single bit of growth. I’m slowly falling apart. If this went on for just a bit longer, I may even take my own life. But……’

He stared straight into Roan’s two eyes.

“In today’s real duel with Sir Baron Tale, I saw some unknown possibility.”

The light in his eyes was blazingly hot.

Roan calmly looked back at that gaze.

As if throwing up a ball of fire, Brian desperately shouted.

“Please consider it as saving a person’s life and take me with you!”

A strange silence fell down.

‘I knew Brian was worried, but to think he was this worried.’

‘Right. He did become more and more lifeless as his seniority went up.’

‘Certainly, he was bright and full of confidence in his first year.’

The students imagined Brian’s former self.

Everyone’s faces became dark.

In truth, Brian who was the kingdom’s pride, the capital’s pride, and the academy’s pride, was in fact on the edge between life and death.

Everyone’s eyes turned toward Roan.

Roan gently stared at Brian.

‘If I don’t grab his hand here……’

Most likely, he will feel even greater despair and disappointment.

Unlike in the last life where he lived until twenty-eight, he might choose the terrible choice even earlier than before.

‘I guess…… I can’t say something like wait until graduation first.’

It became hard to ignore the sincere and desperate look in his eyes any longer.

At that moment.

“Sir Baron! Please take Brian with you!”

“If you take Brian with you, we will definitely pay back your kindness.”

“Please!”

Several students suddenly stood up and shouted.

“You guys……”

Brian’s expression was a bit surprised.

The ones lowering their heads toward Roan were Brian’s classmates in the knight school.

They were the friends he was close with in his first year when everything was well, but slowly became far apart as his stagnation began.

The students’ faces were just as sincere as Brian.

‘Brian is our pride.’

‘I have watched and know how hard he worked.’

‘Brian always swung his sword without missing a single day.’

For Brian, their classmate and friend, they lowered their heads.

At the same time, Roan, who had completely dominated and won against Brian who was called the kingdom’s greatest genius, felt an unknown awe.

“We beg you as well.”

“Please take Brian with you!”

Soon, voices that sympathized with Brian sounded off from here and there.

Instantaneously, the training field was in an uproar.

With a curious look, Katy looked at Roan.

‘Baron Roan Tale. Now what will you do?’

Her large eyes were saying this.

Feeling that gaze, Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘Is this also fate……’

His heart beated at the shouts that poured down.

‘Pierce and Brian, and Harrison and Chris too……’

Somehow, he managed to have the kingdom’s greatest geniuses as his subordinates.

Roan moved his feet towards Brian.

“We beg……”

“Please take……’

Instantly, the students who had been loudly shouting all closed their mouth.

“Student Brian Miles. No, Brian.”

Roan extended his right hand.

“The moment you grab this hand, we will go together.”

Instantly, Brian’s expression brightened.

But on the other hand, Roan’s voice became composed.

“It won’t be an easy path. Think about it thoroughly before……”

When he spoke up to that point.

Brian immediately grabbed Roan’s hand.

Smiling brightly, he stood up.

“I don’t need to think about it. I am already your subject.”

Brian trusted his judgment and decision.

There wasn’t a speck of doubt in his eyes.

Seeing that sight, Roan made a faint smile. (t/n: seriously, what’s up with all these bitter and faint smiles?)

Then.

“Waaaah!”

“Thank you very much! Sir Baron Tale!”

Cheers poured out.

“Brian. You definitely have to become a sword master!”

“I’ll cheer for you!”

The students’ cheers continued.

Katy, who had been watching from the side, also clapped and came up onto the stage.

“Congratulations.”

He wasn’t sure who she was congratulating.

A strange light glowed in her eyes.

That light was a mix of curiosity, goodwill, childishness, and playfulness.

“I want to prepare a place as a congratulation, so…… what do you think?”

A treat to a meal out of the blue.

Roan replied with a difficult expression.

“I already have an appointment with Principal Fred Brown.”

At those words, Katy immediately looked at Fred.

“Principal! You can come with us too. Would that be fine?”

A childish look.

Fred cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

“If Baron Tale is fine with that, then I’m content.”

At those words, Katy looked again at Roan.

‘Just like the prince said, she’s a complete tomboy.’

Inwardly making a bitter smile, Roan lowered his head.

“I will follow princess’ words.”

“Good!”

Katy clenched her fist and was delighted.

“There’s a restaurant on Sears Street that makes unbelievable steaks. Let’s go there.”

She looked rather elated.

Roan and Brian glanced at each other and then followed Katy down the stage.

The students were still cheering.

‘Brian’s popularity is quite amazing.’

Roan marveled as he looked around the training field.

Of course, there were those among the students who complained with dissatisfied and displeased expressions.

Roan didn’t want to especially pay them any attention.

‘They will fall on their own.’

The era that was coming was a one when people’s true colors and abilities were important.

The ones who discriminated and flattered people based on standing, money, and political power will die out by themselves.

‘Of course, there will be those who persistently hold on, but……”

He planned on personally cutting them down.

At that moment, Ian walked up from between the students.

“Princess. May I come as well?”

A bold request.

While Roan looked with a surprised expression, Katy brightly smiled instead and pinched Ian’s left cheek.

“Sure. Since our cute Ian wants to go, of course we’ll take you along.”

A shocking sight.

Roan’s two eyes became round.

‘The genius strategist and administrator of the future, Ian Phillips, is getting his cheek pinched!’

It was a sight that was simply impossible to imagine.

‘Were Ian and Princess Katy originally close friends?’

He thoroughly searched his memories from last life, but nothing that was related came up.

‘Princess Katy only had Pierce.’

Also, Ian didn’t marry and lived alone until he died.

“Princess. I’m now a student of the academy too. Please don’t treat me like a kid so much.”

Ian complained with a slightly annoyed but cute expression.

That sight was also a shock.

‘But he always showed a sharp and serious face even though he is young.’

Without a doubt, he now looked like an ordinary kid.

Furthermore, the difference between Katy and Ian’s age was merely two years.

It was not like there was a big difference in their age.

Katy spoke as she brushed Ian’s head.

“Ian. You’ll always be a little kid to me. From that moment ten years ago when you got lost in the palace library and cried.”

“I was only six at that time. And I wasn’t the only one crying back then. Back then, princess definitely……”

“Sshhh! Stop right there.”

Katy’s eyes wandered off as she shook her head.

Swallowing the words on the tip of his tongue, Ian smacked his lip as if disappointed.

Roan, who had been watching all along, chuckled.

‘So they knew each other ever since they were really young. Now that I see them like this, they look like siblings.’

This kind of experience was fascinating to Roan too.

Since these were things he couldn’t possibly have, see, or hear about in the last life.

At that moment.

‘Hm?’

Roan’s gaze that was staring at Katy and Ian trembled a little.

‘Princess Aily.’

He could see Aily, who quietly stood up amongst the group of students and was walking away.

Roan unconsciously became frantic.

“Princess Katy.”

“Un?”

Katy, who was playfully frolicking with Ian, looked at Roan.

Roan made a short bow.

“May I invite another person?”

“Who? I’m fine. I like it when things are loud.”

“Then. Just a moment……”

Roan faintly smiled and moved his feet.

Katy and several people’s eyes chased Roan’s back.

With slightly hurried steps, Roan walked toward Aily.

“Princess Aily.”

A softly calling voice.

Aily, who was just about to leave the training field, hesitated and then turned around.

“Sir Baron Tale.”

Smiling shyly, Aily slightly lowered her head.

Certainly, the way she interacted with people was different than Katy.

“Thank you very much for the lecture.”

Aily’s cheeks blushed red.

Roan brightly smiled and nodded.

“I’m glad you liked my lecture. By the way, um, princess……”

“Yes?”

“If you perhaps have time, would you please come eat with us?”

A sudden request.

‘What am I doing?’

Roan himself was surprised at what he did.

He awkwardly smiled and looked behind him.

Aily’s gaze naturally followed behind.

Wearing a peculiar expressions, Katy, Fred, and Ian stood there.

‘The person he wanted to invite to the meal is Aily-sis?’

Katy’s expression was slightly surprised.

But she soon shook her head.

‘If it’s Aily-sis’s personality, she’ll immediately reject……’

When she had thought up to that point.

Aily, who everyone was watching, faintly smiled and nodded.

“Sure. Let’s go.”

At those words, everyone’s expressions besides Roan’s was surprised.

It was completely unexpected to think that Aily, whose rumor as a shadow princess was well know, would accept a sudden invitation to a meal.

On the other hand, Roan was simply happy and satisfied with this situation.

He quietly stared into Aily’s two eyes and smiled.

‘Thank you very much.’

Such words hung at the tip of his tongue.

For some reason, he wanted to save his words.

It was difficult to say even a single word.

But he was sure of at least one thing.

‘Princess is also happy.’

Aily’s two eyes conveyed those words.

‘I’m glad I did the special lecture.’

Between his last life and the current life, he felt that this was the best decision he made amongst many.

‘The weather is really nice today.’

Roan stared up at the sky for no reason.

*****

A windowless office lit by a single candle.

“Those guys again?”

An enraged voice echoed through the space.

The owner of the voice was a middle-aged man with neat brown hair and round glasses.

Behind the glasses, his eyes shone with a sharp light.

“Yes. It seems they’re now putting their hands on the palace as well.”

The young man on the other side of the middle-aged man lowered his head.

His face was filled with restlessness.

It was because he only reported bad news these days.

As expected, the glasses man slammed down on the desk.

Boom!

“Since they are hillbilly bumpkins, they just don’t seem to know about the situation in Miller at all. Even we are simply taking a lick.”

“They are definitely insane brats.”

The young man immediately chimed in.

Suddenly, the light in the glasses man’s eyes turned cold.

Every time the candle’s flame quivered, his shadow repeatedly expanded and shrank.

Gulp.

The young man quickly closed his mouth and nervously gulped.

It felt as if his breath was smothered.

With the tip of his finger, the glasses man tapped on the desk.

Tap! Tap! Tap!

The steady sound thoroughly filled the office.

Taap!

The finger finally stopped.

The glasses man scratched the desk with the tip of his finger as he stared sharply at the young man.

“Baba.”

“Yes, yes!”

The young man, Baba, stood up straight and loudly answered.

The glasses man squinted an eye and continued his words.

“Are you just going to watch and let those insane bastards continue to run around?”

“N, no sir.”

Baba quickly shook his head.

The glasses man’s face slowly turned hard.

“The capital region around Miller Castle is our, Janis information agency’s, turf. It’s not where some country bumpkins from the kingdom’s East can run around. You got that?”

“Yes, yes sir. Understood. I’ll send the kids and teach them a lesson.”

The glasses man’s face twisted at Baba’s words.

“You idiot! Do you want to start a war with a noble?”

“The, then?”

Baba asked back with a helpless expression.

The glasses man exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. There are a lot of powerful guests who received our help. There are guests who are still receiving our help too. Just why do you think we’ve been providing those guests information and looking after them? It’s all to receive some help in times like this. Ok? Understood?”

“Yes, yes sir. Understood.”

Only then did Baba finally understood the glasses man’s words and plan.

The glasses man’s rage calmed down a bit only after seeing Baba’s expression.

“Good. Then I’ll leave the work to you this time, Baba. Carefully clean it up.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Baba replied with a seriously nervous face.

Within his head, many people’s faces passed by.

The glasses man waved his hand at that Baba.

Telling him to now leave.

Baba said a short goodbye and soon exited the office.

The glasses man, who was left alone in the dark and small office, licked his dried lips and made a strange smile.

“Was the name Baron Roan Tale……”

The tip of his mouth and eyes slightly trembled.

“The one who just became a noble shouldn’t act too greedy.”

A murderous light reflected in his eyes.

“Even on this floor, there’s something called pecking order.”

*****

A strange mood settled on the dinner table that Katy prepared.

Roan, who could be called the main character of the dinner, was busy talking with Ian, Fred, and Brian.

“Are you really going to build an academy and a library?”

“Yes. If there’s room in the funds, I also wish to make several smaller educational structures as well.”

“That’s quite an amazing plan.”

“But it won’t be easy.”

Katy attempted to enter the conversation several times but didn’t feel like it.

‘Boring. It’s not fun either.’

Things like academies, libraries, or administering branches weren’t fun and were hard to understand.

In the end, she turned her gaze toward Aily, who was on the other side of the table and was quietly focusing on her food.

‘Why did that sis agree to the invitation if she wasn’t even going to say a word?’

In the first place, it was a mystery as to why she decided to come and eat together.

Aily, who was about to put a piece of meat into her mouth, realized Katy’s gaze a bit late.

Looking at the sister a year younger than her, she made a faint smile.

“What are you smiling at?”

Katy was straightforward.

There was no decorum or twist.

She asked about whatever she was curious of and said whatever she wanted to say.

Aily put down the knife and the fork she was holding.

“I smiled because I’m happy.”

“At what?”

Katy asked again.

There was no bad intent.

As the pair’s conversation started, Roan, Fred, Ian, and Brian also stopped their conversation and looked at the girls.

Still with her smile on, Aily replied.

“At everything. The food is good, the mood is good, the company is good.”

The voice was really clear and gentle.

Katy slightly squinted her forehead and tilted her head.

“That famous shadow princess likes these things?”

She even mentioned that unpleasant nickname, shadow princess, as if it was nothing.

At those words, Aily whispered with a quiet voice.

“It seems that the shadow became long enough to touch here and there.”

“It… became longer?”

Katy didn’t understood and asked again.

Aily slowly nodded her head.

‘Un. A light came close by.’

She didn’t let out those last words and rolled them inside of her mouth.

The smile that hung on her mouth became slightly deeper.

Seeing Aily wordlessly smile, Katy as well as Roan and the others tilted their heads.

They still didn’t know much about the shadow princess.

Much more than others, she had many secrets.

Chapter 113




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter that should’ve been posted last week…

Edit: “Iiamas Union” has been renamed to “Aimas Union”.

“Huhuhu. The more I listen, the more I want to go live in the Tale Barony.”

Principal Fred Brown made a hearty laugh.

‘Is it because he was born and raised as a commoner? Or because he hasn’t been a noble for too long? Or perhaps is it because he is originally a rationalist with a kind heart?’

Whatever it was, Roan was a very good person. No, rather than simply a good person, he was a genius of geniuses with an excellent mind and heart.

‘It will only be empty words if a talentless man were to say them, but……’

If it was Roan, who was currently receiving the hottest attention, Roan may at least partially achieve his own dream and beyond. (t/n: here, “he” refers to Principal Fred)

‘It will be good if I can help with that.’

That was his honest thought.

As he held the role of Tron Academy’s principal for twenty years, Fred felt a strange thirst and a limit.

‘An education not only for the rich and the nobles, but an education that anyone can receive as long as one is the kingdom’s citizen.’

He wanted to attempt that.

And the young man in front of him, Roan, was personally trying to achieve what he had only imagined within his head until the age of sixty.

“Baron Tale.”

“Yes. Please speak.”

Roan lowered the teacup and smiled.

Fred thought that the smile looked so gentle yet full of confidence.

“As you know, Tron Academy is where the kingdom’s geniuses gather.”

Roan quietly nodded his head.

Fred’s words continued.

“But it’s not as if every graduate of the Tron Academy gets promoted and succeeds. Some of the students, due to this and that reasons, can’t put their talents to use and are wasting away their lives.”

A crestfallen light twinkled in his eyes.

“I know several of such students. Perhaps, if Baron Tale is willing……”

Fred and Roan’s gazes met in the air.

“I would like to introduce them……’

Fred exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. Of course, they are kids with lots of problems, so they could be rather hard to control and be a headache. You may even earn contempt from those who don’t look kindly upon them as well. But at least, the talent of each and every one of them is exceptional.”

After those words, he looked at Roan.

Now, there was nothing else he could do.

The choices now rested upon Roan.

Gulp.

He nervously swallowed for no reason.

Katy and Aily, and Ian and Brian too, lowered their teacups and looked at Roan.

Feeling everyone’s gazes, Roan faintly smiled.

“Hard to control and could earn other people’s contempt……”

The words rolled inside of his mouth.

Soon enough, he brightly smiled and shook his head.

“That won’t be a problem at all. There are plenty of guys like that among my subordinates. And if it’s Principal Fred Brown’s recommendation, there is no need to even think about it.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

“Rather, I wanted to ask you of that. Please introduce me to those talented geniuses who haven’t spread their wings yet.”

A polite and courteous manner.

Thanks to that, Fred’s nervousness disappeared like the melting snow in the spring.

He let out a hearty laugh.

“Huhuhu. Thank you. Truly, thank you. Now those guys will finally meet a good owner.”

The laughter continued without stopping.

Fred truly felt happy.

‘It would truly be a good opportunity.’

Ian and Brian, who were watching from the sides, also brightly smiled and nodded.

On the other hand, Katy’s expression wasn’t too good.

A rather annoyed but cute look.

‘Cht. Somehow, only they look cool by themselves.’

Although she couldn’t participate due to the academies, libraries, educational facilities and other complicated talks, she wanted to show off a cool look as a princess of a nation.

“Baron Tale.”

A softly calling voice.

“Yes. Princess Katy.”

Roan faintly smiled and turned his head.

Katy slightly raising her head and continued her words with a confident face.

“Baron Tale saved my brother’s life. But now that I think of it, I don’t think I’ve expressed my thanks as his sister. So……”

The tip of her mouth sharply went up.

A look as if she was forcefully holding on but was completely excited.

“If you need anything, say it. I’ll listen.”

Katy carelessly threw out incredible words that not even Simon could say.

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘It seems the tomboy girl wants to feel big.’

From one perspective, it was immature, and from another perspective, it was exceedingly innocent.

It was so transparent, he could easily see her thoughts.

‘There is really no need to refuse. But……’

Realistically, there wasn’t much that Katy could do for him.

Things like financial support or sending talented individuals over wasn’t something the young princess who was still attending the academy could do.

Administration wasn’t something that simple and easy.

‘Even that willful Prince Simon took a step back and is waiting for an opportunity despite being one step short of victory……’

But that didn’t mean there was nothing to earn from Katy.

Roan slightly lowered his head and asked.

“Then, would you please listen to my one request?”

“Is that so? You have something to request of me? Say it. I’ll listen.”

Katy looked even more elated.

Inwardly smiling, Roan answered in a polite manner.

“I would like to use the palace library.”

“The palace library?”

Named Norman Library after the founding king, Norman Rinse, the palace library of the Rinse Kingdom was only accessible by the royalty and members of the most powerful nobilities.

Because precious books from the entire kingdom as well as from the entire continent were stored inside, it wasn’t easy to receive permission to enter.

For Roan, who just became a baron, it wasn’t easy to even receive the test for the entrance pass.

Katy and Roan, as well as all others there, knew this truth.

‘Oho! The palace library……’

Katy’s expression turned strange.

That was part joy and part delight.

‘I can give something like a pass to the palace library as much as I want!’

That was the special privilege her father, King Deni Von Rinse, gave her, who was a student in the academy, for her study.

It was prepared just in case Katy visited the library with her classmates who studied with her.

Of course, Roan knew that Katy had such a privilege thanks to Agens and the information troop’s work.

‘If I didn’t, it wouldn’t be a topic that I could easily bring up.’

If not careful, only Roan’s thought and plan would be exposed.

Then, he heard Katy’s sharp voice.

“Okay! I’ll have the pass to the palace library issued for you.”

“Thank you. Princess.”

Roan brightly smiled as he lowered his head.

‘Yeah. It’s this very feeling.’

Seeing Roan lower his head, Katy felt a small ecstasy.

The fact that she could do something for someone else made her really happy.

She started a rampage that wasn’t quite a rampage.

“Anything else? Is there anything else? Say it. I told you I’ll hear it all, right?”

She was that sort of tomboy.

Roan faintly smiled and shook his head.

“The pass to the palace library is plenty enough.”

“Hmm. That so?”

Katy smacked her lips as if she was disappointed.

Her pouting lips stuck out about as thick as a finger.

The others who were watching from the side inwardly awed at the sight.

But only one person among them, Aily, didn’t look at Katy and looked instead at Roan.

‘A large scale development is starting in the Tale Barony?’

The construction of academies, libraries, and small scale educational facilities too were parts of that development.

Aily took a sip of her tea and lightly closed her eyes.

Within her head, lines extended and drew complicated and solid plans.

‘Should I invest in the Tale region?’

A question she asked to herself.

The answer?

The ends of Aily’s mouth slowly went up.

With that, the answer was as good as decided.

*****

A hill well-shaded by trees deep within the mountains.

The wooden mansion situated in the middle of the hill had quite a view.

In front of the mansion, there was a garden that didn’t fit in with the mountain.

The garden looked as if a skilled gardener had maintained it without skipping a day.

In the middle of the garden, there was a table carved out of a high quality marble.

On that table, a beautiful young man sat there, enjoying a warm cup of tea while reading a book.

“Hmm. Hm.”

As if he was happy, he was even humming a tune.

At that moment.

On the sloping road below, a young man showed up.

Unlike the beautiful young man, he was a rather manly and large young man.

Fluttering his brown and crude-looking travel wear, he walked with bold steps.

The beautiful young man stared at the manly young man, then closed the book he was reading and stood up.

“You came faster than expected. Viscount Raymond.”

A beautiful voice that tickled one’s ears as much as his face.

The manly looking young man, Viscount Guy Raymond, extended his right hand.

“Glad to meet you. Baron Kyword.”

As expected, it was a voice as rough as he looked.

The beautiful young man, Baron Noel Kyword, shook Guy’s large hand and smiled.

“For now, let’s sit down and talk. Would you like a cup of tea?”

Guy shook his head at the polite question.

“I’m fine. Let us cut right to the chase.”

Noel cheerfully smiled and nodded.

“Sure. Let’s do so.”

A relaxed expression.

Even against Guy’s rough reply, he didn’t lose his calm.

Guy squinted his two eyes and the light in his eyes shone.

‘Byron Kingdom’s rising hero, Noel Kyword.’

Noel was originally the firstborn of an ordinary and rural baron house.

Because even the household was ordinary as well, not much was known within the Byron Kingdom as well as in the nearby regions.

In other words, there was nothing special about them.

But when the Byron Kingdom allied with the Istel Kingdom and retreated after it attacked and suffered enormous damage, this presence-less young man revealed his true talent that he had hidden until now.

Within a short amount of time, Noel executed exceptional strategies and tactics, and cleaned up the Orc tribes that had been terrorizing the Byron Kingdom’s north according to Roan’s plan.

Not only that, he brought together and reorganized the Kingdom’s army that received serious damage and perfectly executed the border’s defense with an efficient use of troops.

In other words, he was the kingdom’s hero that raised the falling Byron Kingdom back up.

The Byron royalty paraded Noel as a hero and granted the title of Baron Kyword along with the entire southeast region upon him.

And after that, Noel achieved amazing feats in the central administration.

‘He is similar to our kingdom’s Viscount Peid Neil.’

Peid Neil.

Originally from a commoner background, he was a senior adjutant of the Port troop,

the second corp of the Istel Kingdom’s western troops.

When the Istel Kingdom’s troops lost in the war against Rinse Kingdom, he orchestrated uncanny tactics and strategies while the troops retreated back to the kingdom.

‘Thanks to that, the main troops retreated without harm and Rinse Kingdom’s eastern troops received enormous damage.’

In fact, Gale and the Rose troops were completely wiped out in that chase, and the seventh troop as well as various other troops received heavy damage.

As a result, Roan even went on a rampage.

All that was the work of Peid Neil, the fox of the battlefield.

‘Viscount Neil used the feats from that time as a step, and diligently raised deeds to achieve the title of Viscount.’

Peid and Noel.

For some reason, they were somehow similar.

“Viscount Raymond?”

At that moment, he heard Noel’s voice.

‘Ah, no.’

Only then did Guy get ahold of himself one step late.

‘Now isn’t the time to think of something else. I must finish the work as Viscount Neil instructed and achieve the desired result.’

He coughed several times, and looked straight at Noel.

“I’ll say it straight. Our kingdom needs food.”

“Hmm.”

Noel gulped with a difficult expression.

“As you know, our Byron Kingdom is mostly mountains and wastelands besides the south. We import wheat and various other grains from Estia Empire. But to give food to Istel Kingdom in this situation is quite…… hmm.”

He left his sentence open.

Guy glared at Noel with a sharp light in his eyes.

‘As expected, he’s coming like this.’

This much was certainly expected.

Guy held up the card that Peid handed to him.

“If you provide us with food, we’ll help you when you attack the Pershion Kingdom.”

Immediately, Noel, who had been wearing a repulsive expression, slightly creased his brows.

‘Hmm. They know we are preparing for war.’

One person showed up in his head.

‘Peid Neil. The fox of the battlefield must have smelt it.’

As Guy had said, Byron Kingdom was preparing to attack the Pershion Kingdom in the east.

‘There’s no better opportunity than now.’

There were four kingdoms that shared borders with the Byron Kingdom.

Estia Empire in the west, Rinse Kingdom in the southwest, Istel Kingdom in the southeast, Pershion Kingdom in the east.

Amongst these, there was no cause for invasion from Estia Empire due to the kingdom’s good relation with the empire, and the Istel Kingdom was in a dangerous situation due to repeated poor harvests and the loses from wars.

‘Rinse Kingdom was a bit worrying, but that place is in middle of a sibling fight over the throne.’

As long as no one went out of his way to touch them and made them unite, they too won’t have the time to pay attention to Byron Kingdom.

‘Right now is the perfect time to conquer the Pershion Kingdom.’

And so, the Byron Kingdom was very quietly preparing for a war.

‘The Istel Kingdom will send additional troops in this situation?’

Noel bitterly smiled and shook his head.

“I know the Istel Kingdom’s situation clearly. You’ll wage a war when it’s hard to even eat a single meal per day? It’s honestly hard to believe.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Guy spoke with a great strength in his voice.

“A hungry tiger is, in fact, much more violent.”

From his chest, he took out a half-broken wooden medal.

On the medal, the word Istel were engraved.

“This is the one of the halved seal of our Istel Kingdom’s Northern troop.”

It was a medal that wasn’t quite a medal.

“Viscount Peid Neil holds the other half.”

Guy extended the medal toward Noel.

“We will entrust to you the entire Northern troops, including Viscount Peid Neil and myself Viscount Guy Raymond.”

An extraordinary deal.

With a red face as if about to spit out a ball of fire, Guy continued his words.

“Please buy us.”

A desperate voice.

The Istel Kingdom’s situation was that bad.

‘I did hear that the negotiation with Aimas Union fell down……’

Noel exhaled a short sigh.

He stared at the medal and considered for a moment.

No, he merely pretended to think and took time.

‘It’s a deal that we have no reason to refuse.’

Again, Noel exhaled a long sigh.

“Hu. It’s a really difficult choice. A situation where I can’t do this, or do that……”

He acted serious for a moment, then clenched his teeth as if he had come to a decision.

Noel looked at Guy and nodded.

“Okay. Originally, our Byron Kingdom and Istel Kingdom are old friends. How could I ignore a friend’s hardship?”

He extended his hand and took the medal.

“The medal of Istel Kingdom’s northern troops, I, Noel Kyword, will receive it.”

An act as if receiving a big responsibility.

‘Kuk.’

A hot flame poured out to Guy’s throat, but he clenched his teeth and endured.

‘Just a little longer, I’ll endure just a little longer. Once the Kingdom’s situation improves, then……’

A fierce and cold glare was pointed at Noel.

‘I’ll have all of Byron Kingdom kneel down.’

A hellfire burned inside, but Guy forced a smile.

At that moment, Noel made a strange expression.

“Anyhow, this is that, and……”

An eyebrow greatly twitched

“Have you perhaps heard of Rinse Kingdom’s Roan?”

Immediately, Guy creased his forehead.

Because at the completely unexpected place, and at a completely unexpected moment, he heard a name he didn’t want to hear.

He looked at Noel and replied with a quiet voice.

“Within our Istel Kingdom’s troops, there is no one who doesn’t know the crimson ghost.”

Chapter 114




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Thank you st8_lupe for staying up with me until late to proofread it. Also, the sponsored chapter will probably be posted tomorrow (basically about 24hrs from release of this chapter)

Edit: Uuh… just a little heads up for people who are waiting, the sponsored chapter may be a bit delayed. Sorry about the inconvenience.

“Brian. I told you, there’s no need to go that far.”

As he let out a long sigh, Roan was flabbergasted.

His eyes turned to Brian, who was following behind him.

“No. I’m really okay.”

Brian vigorously smiled as he replied.

From head to toe, he was covered in armor.

The problem was.

“Even if the basics are important, I didn’t mean that you should wear heavy armor like that even on regular days.”

The armor Brian was wearing was an extremely heavy armor that wasn’t usually worn even for battles.

Brian shook his hand.

“No no. As Sir Baron said, the basics are important. Also, I have also stopped my mana training since yesterday too.”

“Hm.”

Roan tried to say few more words but soon closed his mouth.

It was because Brian’s face was too serious.

‘He’ll probably stop after a few days.’

Roan shook his head and once again moved his feet.

Austin, who was walking along at the side, stuck close and quietly whispered.

“That guy. Is he really a genius? From what I see, he looks a bit lacking somewhere.”

Roan chortled at those words.

At that moment, Brian’s voice rang out.

“Sir Hundred-man Commander Austin! I really am a genius!”

As the firstborn of the Viscount Miles’ house, Brian’s standing was a noble, but now that he had become Roan’s subordinate, the hierarchy was set according to the military rank.

Therefore, Brian, who was a common soldier, held Austin, a hundred-man commander, as his superior and spoke politely.

Of course, Austin, and the ten-man commanders below him, felt awkward at first trying to talk down on Brian, who was the son of a noble. But because Brian lowered his head and came in first, the ups and downs were organized without a problem.

Looking at Brian who was tottering on, Austin shook his head.

“I’m not sure about being a genius, but at least his strength is really good.”

With a snicker, a skeptical laugh leaked out.

All the while, Roan busily moved his feet and carefully inspected the inside of Miller Castle.

Before Simon’s orders and Katy’s pass to the Palace Library were issued, he planned to meticulously look around the entirety of Miller Castle, the largest and most developed place in the kingdom.

‘Perhaps because it’s the capital, it’s well organized.’

Most of the roads were wide and clean and the placements of houses and shops were highly efficient.

‘I need to make the Tale barony as good as, no, better than Miller Castle.’

But even if he said that, Roan couldn’t do everything by himself.

Also, he was a soldier who spent most of his life on the battlefield.

Within his head, there were several extraordinary plans that Roan saw and experienced, but he slightly lacked the ability to actually realize them.

‘I need various geniuses from multiple fields.’

It wasn’t possible to develop the barony with only strong warriors.

At least, it was good that Principal Fred Brown had recommended Tron Academy’s graduates to him.

‘Once they come, there should be a little more room to breath.’

Of course, if they were people hard to control like Fred said, he should be resolved for some trouble.

While he thought about various things, Roan’s feet arrived at the slums located on the edge of Miller Castle.

“Hhm.”

Austin, who was walking by his side, creased his forehead and pinched his nose.

A headache ensued from the incredible stench.

Ten steps.

From the glamorous and wide road that crossed the Castle, they had walked merely ten steps.

But the sight that unfolded in front of their eyes was completely different compared to the brilliant Miller Castle from just before.

A road that two people could barely walk past each other.

A small creek crossed that road.

The source of the stench was that creek.

In the murky waters where not even the bottom could be seen, various trash and bugs filled the creek.

“Cough! Cough!”

“Uaaah! Mommy!”

“Uuhuhuhuhugh.” 1

“Sh*t! Dammit! Who is crying and being all gloomy and noisy?!”

The coughs of the sick, cries of a woman and a child, cursing of a drunkard.

All kinds of cruel sounds filled the alley and echoed out here and there.

“Sir Baron. This looks like the slums however I look at it, so let us stop here and go back.”

Austin was still plugging his nose.

On the other hand, Roan looked at the decrepit and dirty alley with a serious expression.

Thin and haggard people looked at Roan and his companions with caution in their eyes.

‘I too was like that once.’

A memory he temporarily forgot.

Miserable scenes brushed through his head.

Slightly shaking his head, Roan looked at Brian.

“Brian. Where is this?”

“This is the Aran Alley. It’s the poorest place in Miller Castle. I have also only heard rumors of this place and this is the first time I have actually come here.”

Even for Brian, who attended Tron Academy, it was his first time in Aran Alley.

“Does the administration of Miller Castle or the palace not know about the situation here?”

Brian bitterly smiled at Roan’s question.

“Of course not. They know everything. They are simply keeping their hands away as such.”

“Why?”

Roan soon regretted after he asked the question.

‘There wouldn’t be any reason why. The people high above wouldn’t be able to see places this low.’

As expected.

“Who knows. I’m also not sure about that.”

Brian shook his head with an empty expression.

“Hu.”

Roan let out a long sigh and looked at Austin.

“What are the Amaranth troops doing at this moment?”

The number of the Amaranth troops who accompanied Roan to the capital, Miller, totaled 200 people.

“Several soldiers are on a mission with the information squad and the rest of the soldiers are carrying out individual training and squad tactics training.”

Even though it wouldn’t be weird to momentarily hesitate or be moved by the brilliant Miller Castle, the Amaranth troops were going about the same daily routine as always.

They didn’t make light of their mission and their duty.

Of course, it was same for Roan.

As expected, he decreased his hours of sleep and focused on training the Flamdor mana technique and the Reid fighting style.

In addition, these days he was combining various spear styles from real battles into one fighting style.

This work would’ve been impossible for the past Roan, but using the techniques of the Reid fighting style, he was able to at least look the part.

Although, he would have to see if it will be useful.

Roan nodded his head and waved his hand.

“Excluding the troops moving with the information squad, call all the troops here to Aran Alley.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Austin didn’t ask why.

It was because Roan didn’t gave out pointless orders.

Soon, Austin exited Aran Alley.

Brian, who was standing behind, asked with a careful tone.

“What, what are you planning to do?”

At those words, Roan stared at Aran Alley and gave a short reply.

“I plan to shine the light of glory upon this alley.”

“Yes?”

Brian didn’t understand and asked again.

But instead of answering, Roan faintly smiled.

Soon, the Amaranth troop showed up with a loud noise.

Brian unconsciously stared at them, then stopped and widely opened his eyes.

His gaze stopped on the left side of their breastplates.

On the left side of the breastplate, there was a coat of arms depicting a flower petal, two spears, and one shield.

And a short sentence written around them.

Let our path be accompanied by the light of glory.

Roan’s words were that of the sentence written on the crest of Tale Barony.

*****

“Did you hear that story?”

“Which story?”

“The one about Sir Baron Tale.”

“Ah! The Amaranth troop?”

“Yeah. That.”

Next to a beautiful road, people gathered.

Grouping together here and there, they were all busy talking about one story.

“It’s already the eighth day, right?”

“Right. The day they started cleaning Rott Creek in Aran Alley and looking after the people in the slums was exactly eight days ago.”

With slightly surprised faces, the people were flabbergasted.

That was because anyone who was a resident of Miller was quite aware of just how dirty and disgusting Aran Alley and Rott Creek was.

It was to the point where one would throw up his breakfast just by coming near.

“What a strange person.”

“You said it. Is he perhaps like that because it hasn’t been long since he became a noble?”

“Maybe.”

The very protagonists of the hottest rumor in Miller Castle were Roan and the Amaranth troop.

“If he just became a noble, shouldn’t he be greeting powerful nobles or holding a dance hall?”

“Exactly. That’s the politics of nobles and their society.”

It was a statement fitting for a resident of Miller.

But even so, they were of course commoners.

“But I wouldn’t mind if there were more nobles like him.”

“Of course. If other nobles were like Sir Baron Tale…… huu.”

At that moment, all the people who were gossiping by the road looked towards one place and exclaimed.

“Oh! It’s Sir Baron Tale.”

“It’s the Amaranth troop.”

Half unnerved voices.

That was no wonder, as the sight and look of Roan and the Amaranth troop simply couldn’t be seen as that of a regal noble and his followers.

Shabby work clothes greatly covered in filth.

In their two hands were brooms and rags instead of swords and spears.

‘It, it’s more extreme than the rumors.’

‘I, I never saw a noble like this.’

The residents were astounded.

But that shock definitely wasn’t something repulsive.

Somehow, it felt joyous and fulfilling.

Clap!

At Roan and the Amaranth troop that walked by in front of them, someone clapped.

Clap! Clap!

The sound of clapping slowly spread.

Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

Soon, the entire street was filled with the sound of claps.

As if shy, the Amaranth troop awkwardly smiled and hurried their feet.

But at the very least, their two eyes were full of unconcealable pride and respect.

‘As expected, it’s good that we did as Sir Baron said.’

The members of the troop all tightly clenched their fist as one.

‘We’ll absolutely trust Sir Baron and follow him until the end.’

With this event as a catalyst, the troop’s loyalty became even deeper.

*****

Roan wasn’t the type to simply give out orders and sit back.

He always moved before his troops.

Austin tried to stop Roan on multiple occasions, but each time, Roan replied with the same words and clearly expressed his will.

“When I have all my limbs cut off and my body beaten so that only my mouth is alive, I’ll only order with my mouth.”

Roan wasn’t a leader who simply talked with his mouth.

Even now, he was cleaning the Rott Creek, where the dirtiest and most repulsive smells originated.

Rott Creek was a small streamlet that flowed across Aran Alley, but was currently polluted with various filth.

‘The poor of the Aran alley are using this water as drinking water.’

A truthfully horrible state.

Because of that, Roan first ordered the Amaranth troop to clean Rott Creek.

Furthermore, he bought clean water and bread in bulk and handed them out plentifully to the people of Aran Alley.

It had costed much more money than expected, but he didn’t feel any regret.

‘If it’s money, I can just earn it again.’

In the first place, it was money gathered to use like this.

Walking along Rott Creek, Roan continued to clean out the trash.

“He’s really incredible.”

“Even though he became a noble, he didn’t change at all.”

“What are you talking about? He’s looking after people below him even more now compared to before.”

“Yeah. Right. Maybe the words true noble refers to Sir Baron Tale.”

Staring at Roan completely focused on cleaning, several members of the troop were amazed.

At that moment, a man with his face full of grime dragged his two feet and appeared.

The clothes he had over him was more of a rag than a cloth.

Because his hair grew out without restraint and covered his eyes, and because he was simply too dirty, it was hard to even estimate his age.

The man wobbled towards Roan.

When the members of the troop who were watching from the side tried to intervene just in case something happened, Roan shook his head and signalled them with his eyes.

Sending the troops back, Roan smiled towards the man staring at him.

“May I help you?”

Even after becoming a noble, Roan used polite speech to everyone except his subordinates and in special cases.

The man wordlessly stood and stared at Roan, then took out a piece of bread.

It was a rather dirty piece of bread with black spots speckled around.

“I thought you might be hungry, so I brought this.”

An unexpectedly clear and young voice.

Roan brightly smiled and nodded.

“Thank you very much.”

He received the dirty bread as if it was nothing, and took a large bite.

Seeing this, the man roughly sat down on the side of the Rott Creek without a word.

Scratching his neck with the tip of his finger, he looked at Roan.

“Sir Baron Tale. Why are you helping us poor of Aran Alley when we don’t have any connections or relations?”

A sudden question.

Brushing off the bread crumbs on his mouth, Roan answered.

“Is there any need for a reason to help someone else? I simply wish that the life in this place becomes better even by a little bit.”

“Hhm.”

The man let out a short sigh.

Picking his nose this time, he asked.

“This year, I turned exactly twenty nine. I want to do something big before turning thirty, so may I perhaps work in the Tale Barony?”

At those words, Roan stared at the man with calm eyes.

There were certainly hairs covering his two eyes, but even his eyes were small too, so it was hard to look at his eyes.

Roan soon smiled brightly and nodded his head.

“You can do anything as long as you have the determination. Sure. Let’s work together.”

The man’s eyes slightly trembled at those words.

Scratching the back of his head, he asked again.

“Can I enter the Amaranth troop?”

“If your scores in the newbie training camp is good, sure.”

“Can I be a ten-man commander and a hundred-man commander?”

“If you have merits that are fitting, then of course.”

There was no hesitation in Roan’s answers.

The man hesitated for a moment, then asked again.

“If I keep on raising merits, can I go even higher?”

At those words, Roan brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“If you raise really great merits, I can give you my place.”

“Hhm.”

The man let out a short sigh once again.

His expression was slightly shocked.

But soon, he greatly yawned and lowered his head.

Roan quietly watched that sight and soon returned to cleaning up the trash.

After an unknown amount of time.

“Hu.”

Roan breathed out a short sigh.

A satisfied expression.

The clean up of the entire creek was finished.

At that moment, the man, who was quietly sitting until now, stood up and lowered his head.

“Thank you very much for cleaning so well. Sir Baron Tale.”

Roan simply smiled at those words.

When Roan once again began to walk, the man abruptly walked in close and whispered with a quiet voice.

“As a thanks for cleaning our Rott Creek so well, I’ll give you a simple prediction.” (t/n: prophesy? It’s basically what those people with tarot cards do for a living)

The man suddenly grabbed Roan’s hand and murmured unrecognizable words.

Then he soon squinted his eyes and made a strange smile.

“When the owl brings a branch, there will be great danger to your body, so please be careful.”

Simply hard to understand words.

Roan creased his forehead and looked at the man in front of his eyes.

‘This man…… who is he?’

When he thought so.

The man once again deeply lowered his head.

“My name is Clay.”

He slowly raised his head and looked straight into Roan’s eyes.

The glaringly wide eyes were already back to before.

Eyes so small that one wonders if he could even see what was in front of him.

Clay faintly smiled and finished his words.

“Please do remember.”

It was unknown whether he meant remember his name, or the prophecy.

Chapter 115




Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter. Thank you very much for your supports.

In two years at the earliest, and in five years at the latest, the world started to drastically change.

Emperors and kings as well as nobles, big-time merchants, and other such powerful people began to competitively focus on gathering talented people.

There wasn’t any special reason.

It was merely one of the methods to live a better life than others.

But the Great Warring Era began to sprout at that moment.

‘As the time passed, factions with overwhelming strength and financial power appeared.’

Whether those factions were emperors, kings, or nobles wasn’t important.

That was because the appearance of powerful factions always led to competition and war.

Of course, there were several big events and accidents besides that.

As the various circumstances tangled and became complicated, the world finally entered the Great Warring Era.

‘I need to find the hidden geniuses who weren’t found in the last life.’

The reason Roan came to this thought.

It was because of Clay, the small-eyed young man he met in Aran Alley.

‘He definitely wasn’t an ordinary man.’

The inexplicable prediction he left.

When the owl brings a branch, there will be great danger to your body, so please be careful.

Two days had already passed since he met Clay, but forget an owl, he didn’t even see a common sparrow.

‘Is an owl not the owl?’ 1

If he could, he wanted to meet Clay again once more, but Clay simply couldn’t be found anymore for some reason.

‘Since I left the work to the guys in the information squad for now, the news will arrive soon.’

Roan forced the small thoughts out of his head and moved his feet.

As always, he was going to Aran Alley today.

At that moment, he heard a familiar voice from behind.

‘Sir Baron.’

When Roan stopped and turned around, he saw Keep approaching from far away.

‘Did they find him already?’

However excellent Keep and the information squad was, this was much faster than what he thought.

“Sir Baron. There is an important report.”

Keep, who arrived in front of Roan by that time, glanced around the surroundings once and whispered in a quiet voice.

“Miller Castle is moving as we wished.”

“Hm?”

Because it wasn’t the report he was expecting, Roan looked slightly surprised.

But he soon erased his expression.

Keep took out a small paper from his chest.

Roan took it and placed it in his chest, and then slightly nodded his head.

“Then. I will go now.”

Keep executed a short salute and then walked into a crowd.

Soon, his back disappeared from sight.

A meeting finished in a literal instant.

Roan sharply heightened his five senses and slowly moved his steps.

The destination was no longer Aran Alley.

He hid naturally into a crowd.

As much as he was good at exuding his presence, Roan was just as good at hiding it.

And when he actively used Brent’s ring on top of it, his presence turned hazy even if he was right in front of another person’s nose.

Roan, who was flitting through the crowd and following the busy road, entered a small alley formed between two stores that almost touched.

The alley, where not even the sunlight touched, was extremely dark, but it posed no problem for Roan.

He moved his feet without pause and after turning multiple times in the complicated alleyways, he stopped at a rather dark and remote location.

Sssk.

When he took out and unfolded the paper from his chest, he saw small words tightly written on the paper.

The movement of the Janis information agency, an information group working around Miller Castle, is unusual.

The small paper was a type of report.

Although Keep diligently learned words after taking charge the information squad, incorrect words could be seen here and there.

But it wasn’t at a level where the content couldn’t be understood.

They finally took the bait.

Words that brimmed with confidence.

A smile also formed on Roan’s mouth.

‘It didn’t take as long as I had expected.’

Composed eyes and face.

In truth, Keep and the members of the Amaranth information squad operating loudly was all a planned move.

‘Since I need to place groundwork in Miller Castle.’

Roan planned on gathering the information agencies that moved around Miller Castle.

And a part of that plan was provoking the Janis information agency.

‘So, they are plan on attacking me and my information squad?’

Keep and the information squad had a complete grasp of the Janis information agency’s moves.

But.

What sort of plan they are preparing is currently being investigated.

They have yet to find out just how the Janis information agency planned on attacking.

But Roan trusted Keep and the information squad.

‘Find out at your own pace.’

For now, he had to focus on something else.

‘By now, I probably have spies on me.’

It was certainly possible.

Roan folded the paper and put it in his chest and then made a peculiar expression.

‘Now, should I go and check?’

He exited the alleyway and once again headed to Aran Alley.

At the entrance of Aran Alley, a countless number of people stood there.

If he was a normal person it would be almost impossible to find the spies amongst the large number of people.

But Roan had Kalian’s Tears.

Pat!

When he focused his eyes, the movements of the people, who completely crowded the alley, moved slowly as if they were standing still.

‘Hmm.’

Within that small instant, an incredible amount of visual information poured in.

The eyes heated up as if they would explode and a headache approached.

Roan clenched his teeth and carefully observed every part of the alley.

At the same time, he moved his feet not toward Aran Alley, but to the right.

A slow and tedious movement that makes one feel like yawning.

Even during that time, Roan didn’t miss a single line of sight of every person that filled the alley.

Then.

‘There they are!’

The tips of Roan’s mouth slowly went up.

There were exactly four people whose eyes turned following the tip of his foot that suddenly changed directions.

From a glance, they looked like completely ordinary middle-aged men.

Pretending to be complete strangers from one another, each of them was concentrating on their own work.

‘Four people……’

The smile on his mouth became deeper.

Pleasant plans passed through his head.

‘It’s the perfect number to play around with.’

Roan then shook his head and blinked his eyes.

Immediately, the people, who were moving slowly as if they were standing still, moved in their original speeds.

The murmuring noises turned back to clear voices in conversation.

Roan stretched for no reason and switched his direction once again toward Aran Alley.

As expected, the four spies subtly glanced at Roan several times.

Tragically, they hadn’t realized the fact that their identities were compromised.

*****

“Nanny.”

“Yes. Princess. Please speak.”

Margaret brightly smiled and stopped the work she was doing.

At that sight, Aily made a faint smile.

A look as if she had completely finished the thought she had for the last few days.

“I have decided. I plan on investing in the Tale Barony.”

“Princess.”

Margaret put down the cleaning supplies she was holding and moved towards Aily.

“Certainly, Baron Tale is the most famous person these days, but he is someone who just became a noble. I don’t think he is such a good target to invest in.”

Aily nodded at those words.

“If we only consider the current situation, you’re right.”

Soon as she finished her words, Margaret made a strange expression.

“But you’re going to invest in him? It’s not perhaps because there’s a different feeling, no?”

Until now, Aily’s investments were extremely cold and calculated.

Thanks to that, there was not a single failure.

“What do you mean a different feeling?”

Aily shyly smiled as she asked back.

“That, that is……”

Margaret panicked and stuttered her words.

Aily cheerfully smiled and shook her head.

“I”m investing while looking at the future value of Sir Baron Tale.”

“Future value?”

“Yes.”

Aily slowly nodded her head and continued speaking.

“Sir Baron Tale will definitely become a great person. The Tale Barony too would become much larger and a brilliant land. That is definite.”

Her gaze turned to Margaret’s eyes.

“If I invest then, it will be too late. If I’m going to invest, this is the perfect time. While no one has invested, I’ll invest faster than anyone else.”

The expression that was always gentle and shy became confident and assured.

“Hhm. If princess says so, it should be right.”

Until now, Aily’s eyes for people were never wrong.

But, there was one thing that Margaret was worried about.

‘She didn’t perhaps become completely smitten during that time, right?’

Margaret was worried that Aily’s eyes for people may have been blinded by the unfamiliar feeling she felt for the first time in her life.

But Aily had even noticed Margaret’s doubt already.

‘Nanny. Don’t worry too much.’

She inwardly made a smile.

‘My eyes are clearer and more precise than ever before.’

Such a strong certainty was a first.

Aily’s two cheeks blushed red.

‘That person is special.’

She wasn’t sure exactly what it was, but she felt so.

As if.

‘Like that person.’

*****

Aran Alley was receiving unexpected attention.

It was all thanks to Roan.

It was because a few nobles envied Roan and also went on poverty-relief projects when Roan received passionate cheers from the residents of Miller as he emptied his personal funds to clean the entirety of Aran Alley and Rott Creek and provided water and food.

Thanks to that, the people of Aran Alley experienced goodwill and good food that they had never experienced before.

When the situation progressed to this point, Roan left only a few information squad members in the Aran Alley and pull out the Amaranth troop.

It was a judgment that their jobs were now finished.

When they cleaned up their temporary lodgings and were preparing to leave, the people of Aran Alley gathered one by one.

The people, who were greatly guarded when Roan and Amaranth troop first visited, now had a close enough relationship where they boldly walked up and shook hands.

“Sir Baron Tale. And everyone of the Amaranth troop. Truly, thank you very much.”

“Thank you very much.”

“Really, thank you very much.”

Toward Roan and Amaranth troop, the people bowed.

“I’m glad we could be of help.”

Roan and the Amaranth troop quickly saluted.

An awe-inspiring sight.

The people of Aran Alley even came out to the main street to see Roan and Amaranth troop off.

Several residents of Miller also came out to the street to clapped and cheered.

‘How reliable.’

The support of the people of Aran Alley and the residents of the surroundings.

It may look like a seemingly meaningless relation, but this would become a great asset to him in the future.

‘This is the scene I want. A scene where everyone comes and lives together.’

Roan smiled at the sound of claps that poured down.

A feeling of confirmation that his actions until now weren’t wrong.

When he looked back, the members of the Amaranth troop also wore proud expressions.

‘Even if it takes a little bit longer, we’ll go on our own way.’

He believed that the means were just as important as the final result.

Roan deeply inhaled.

His steps became slightly faster.

*****

It look longer than expected for Katy to issue the pass to the palace library.

Simon too, from meeting various nobles and solidifying his bases, was too busy.

Thanks to that, Roan was able to focus on the training he had been slightly neglecting.

Of course, he didn’t only train.

‘They peeked again.’

Roan noticed that the small bag he left below a tree was slightly disheveled.

But with no sign of caring, he turned his shoulder and sat down on the ground.

‘Those guys from the Janis information agency. They didn’t even realize that what they’ve been peeking at are all false informations……’

A laughter came out again and again.

So far, Roan acted as if he didn’t notice the Janis information agency’s spies.

That wasn’t all.

With Keep, he falsified information and intentionally exposed it or barely guarded it.

And each time, the spies secretly checked the false information and reported to the Janis information agency’s headquarters.

To make checkable false information look real, there were times when Keep and the information squad members played an act.

Thanks to that, the spies of the Janis information agency believe that the information that Roan was poorly guarded was all true.

‘Then should I start training again?’

Various plans were progressing calmly and well.

With a light heart, Roan stood up and grabbed the Travias Spear.

At that moment.

“Sir Baron!”

Austin’s voice was heard.

He hurriedly ran over and gave a short salute.

“What is it?

At the lightly asked question, Austin calmed his breath and answered.

“Someone from Viscount Holten’s house came.”

“Holten?”

Roan creased his forehead.

It was a place he had no relation with and even the name of the house was unfamiliar.

Austin nodded his head.

“Yes. They brought an invitation.”

“An invitation? An invitation for what?”

Roan tilted his head.

“It seems you’ll have to personally check it.”

At Austin’s words, Roan placed the Travias Spear at his waist and moved his feet.

‘Viscount Holten……’

Even if he searched his memories, nothing really came up.

In the end, he had to personally meet them.

Roan widely shook his head and hastened his steps.

After exiting the training hall and going through two buildings, a young man in a clean suit was seen.

“It is an honor to meet you.”

The young man greeted very politely.

A noble’s etiquette.

From his chest, he took out a stiff invitation.

“Sir Viscount Anthony Holten plans on hosting a hunting competition. He wishes for Sir Baron Tale to participate.”

“Hhm.”

A hunting competition.

It was something completely unexpected.

But Roan didn’t show his emotion and received the invitation while smiling faintly.

The crisp invitation was sealed in wax.

At that moment.

‘Un?’

Roan’s eyes slightly trembled.

His eyes stopped on the wax seal’s design.

Usually, the wax seal represented the seal or the symbol of the house sending an invitation.

Roan looked at the young man that handed him the invitation and asked with a soft voice.

“This symbol on the wax seal is rather unique.”

The young man cheerfully smiled at those words.

“Yes. It seems Sir Viscount Holten likes to use as an addition to the house’s seal.”

“I see.”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

His gaze once again turned towards the wax seal.

The light in his eyes slowly became composed.

‘The symbol of the wax seal is……’

His heart sped up.

‘A tree branch……’

Was it a simple coincidence?

Clay’s face appeared in his head.

Chapter 116




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter.

“By now, he should have received the branch……”

The young man happily making a strange smile was in fact Clay.

Unlike when he met Roan, his looks were completely different.

The hair was neatly organized and his suit looked neat and clean despite being old and humble.

But the thin eyes that seemed doubtful whether it could see in front were the same.

Standing on the summit of a rather tall mountain, he looked down at the wide open field that spread out below.

“Whenever I see it, it’s quite the beautiful sight.”

But the smile on his mouth was instead bitter.

“Although it’s probably hell when up close.”

Just how many people live in pain down below.

Clay’s mouth felt bitter.

“There’s just no good person. A good person……”

No, just a good person isn’t good enough.

He also had to have the strength and ability to change the world.

And at the same time.

‘Someone who could recognize my talent.’

Such a person was needed.

Clay wasn’t a philanthropist and neither was he a saint.

He was the type that was only satisfied when he received treatment that was on par with his abilities.

‘It would be good if Sir Baron Tale is such a person, but……’

He let out a long sigh.

‘If he isn’t worth serving then I should go into the mountains and spend the rest of my life reading books.’

It would be a waste to not use the vast knowledge within his head, but he had no desire to carelessly use them.

‘I’m sorry since it feels like I’m going against master’s tenants, but……’

Make the world a better place.

That was the master’s teaching.

But he didn’t want to do good for the world without any rewards.

Clay inhaled deeply as he looked down at the field.

“Should I go down about now?”

It had already been four days since he entered the mountain.

Clay slowly moved his feet.

‘Come to think of it, I wonder how the elder brothers are doing.’

The sorely missed faces suddenly appeared in his mind.

But he soon shook his head.

‘The elder brothers should have already accomplished more than just settling down.’

That’s just how talented they were.

‘I should just worry about my own future.’

It would be fine to be nosy after that.

Clay’s footsteps slowly became faster.

*****

“Is that so?”

Roan checked once again.

Keep nodded his head.

“Yes. We checked through multiple routes. The symbol of Viscount Holten House is……”

The two’s eyes met in the air.

“Definitely an owl.”

“Hhm.”

Roan let out a low sigh.

‘Is this owl the owl Clay was talking about?’

There wasn’t any way to be certain.

But the invitation the owl sent was stamped with the symbol of a tree branch.

A combination too perfect to be called a coincidence.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Roan tapped on the table with the tip of his finger.

His thoughts became deeper.

‘He said that there would be great danger to me when the owl brings a branch. If so……’

If he saw the Viscount Anthony Holten as the owl and the invitation as the branch, then there was a great possibility that this hunting competition wasn’t ordinary.

Tap.

Roan stopped the finger that was tapping on the table and looked at Keep.

“Keep. Thoroughly investigate the hunting competition Viscount Holten and his house is hosting.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Keep slightly lowered his head and answered.

With a cold expression, Roan spoke one more time.

“You cannot miss even a single, small detail.”

“Yes. I’ll keep it in mind.”

With a resolute expression, Keep once again lowered his head.

‘This is the first time he emphasized something twice.’

Roan was usually the type to trust and let other be after he gave out a command once.

Until now, there had never been a time when he would emphasize or give out the same order multiple times.

‘This mission, it’s exceptionally important.’

Keep clenched his fist.

With a short salute, he exited the office.

“Huu.”

Roan, who was left alone, let out a short sigh and grabbed a pen.

He needed to organize the chaotic thoughts within his head.

‘I must have really become a noble.’

A sensation of truly being in the center of a behind-the-scenes fight.

‘But either way, I don’t plan on being taken down without a fight.’

It would be wrong to think of him as a mere amateur noble that just became a baron.

He was a veteran soldier that walked the battlefield for twenty years.

‘Then, should I start the fight?’

A fight without a sword or a spear.

The battlefield was the capital, Miller.

The first to attack may be Viscount Anthony Holten, but Roan was already preparing a counterattack.

*****

“Sir Duke. However you think, it can’t be helped to be disappointed.”

Viscount Lary Borg, who turned exactly forty this year, shook his head with a disappointed look.

The white haired elder sitting across from him creased his forehead.

“There’s no need to be disappointed. Because what’s important now is who will be the next king.”

The elder, who was letting off a strong pressure despite being old, was Edwin Voisa, one of the four dukes of the Rinse Kingdom and the one with the strongest faction.

Lary smacked his lips.

“But if he stayed a bit longer, he would have even received a title of nobility from Estia Empire……”

“Quiet! Don’t say unnecessary things.”

Edwin loudly shouted and glared with his two eyes.

‘Oops!’

Suddenly shocked, Larry closed his mouth.

“Mills is the firstborn of our Duke House and the next duke of the Rinse Kingdom. He must be known only as that to the people. Do you understand?”

Lary quickly lowered his head at Edwin’s words.

“Yes. I, I understand.”

“Hmm.”

Edwin didn’t look very convinced.

No, he looked completely annoyed.

Truthfully, he didn’t really like summoning Mills Voisa, the firstborn who was studying abroad in Estia Empire, back to Rinse Kingdom.

‘Even though the results of purposely sending him abroad to the unfriendly Estia Kingdom were just starting to come out. Tch.’

If he stayed a bit longer, he would have been able to receive a title of nobility from Estia Empire.

‘Dammit.’

He grinded his teeth.

‘The rest of the damned dukes are calling back all the kids sent out to other kingdoms.’

With the monster expedition as the trigger, the competition for the next king had truly began.

In this situation, Edwin simply couldn’t just stand by and do nothing while the other dukes moved.

‘I don’t want to admit it, but the other damned dukes’ children, as expected, have been outstanding talents since they were young.’

If they returned, he may be left behind in the competition for the throne.

Because of that, Edwin also quickly summoned his firstborn, Mills, back to the kingdom.

‘If Mills comes back, those brats wouldn’t be able to do anything even if they come as a group.’

He trusted Mills.

To Edwin, Mills was the pride and treasure of the house.

‘Once Mills comes back, we can flip this situation where the first prince is in the lead.’

His eyes were cold and a smile hung from his mouth.

The return of the duke houses’ successors.

Rinse Kingdom’s competition for the throne had now entered a new stage.

*****

Tak.

Roan put down the thick stack of paper with a satisfied look.

“Good. It’s good enough with this.”

“Thank you.”

The person lowering his head on the opposite side was Keep.

For some reason, his face looked haggard and rough.

Roan stood up from his seat and grabbed Keep’s hand.

“Keep. You’ve really done a lot of work.”

“No sir. I simply did what I had to do.”

Keep lowered his head.

Because he had been meticulously investigating the hunting competition that Anthony and Viscount Holten’s house prepared, he hadn’t had an ounce of sleep in the last three days.

It was a tiring and hard mission, but his heart skipped a bit every time a hidden information was revealed.

‘If we passed it without knowing, Sir Baron would have been in great danger.’

He once again felt how powerful information was.

At that moment, he heard Roan’s voice.

“Now, should we put together a plan of our own based on this information?”

A face full of playfulness.

Keep brightly smiled without knowing and nodded.

“An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. And we should return a trap for a trap.”

Roan nodded instead of answering at those words.

Soon, Austin and Harrison, the two hundred-man commanders, and the ten-man commanders below them were called.

Putting his head together with them, Roan began a heated debate.

Each’s words hit against one another and a plan was slowly formed.

At the same time, words poured down onto an empty white paper.

Meticulously and perfectly, the plan was constructed.

*****

“Hhm. This is quite troublesome.”

The young man’s expression was extremely serious.

He was looking at three cards on top of a table.

The middle-aged man, who was staring at that scene from the side, cheerfully smiled and shook his head.

“Please don’t lie. You have already made your decision.”

At those words, the young man scratched his nose and brightly smiled.

“Does it show?”

“Of course. It has already been thirty years since I supported Master Clyde. I can tell with just a glance.”

“Thirty years? Even though I’m thirty years old right now?”

The young man, Clyde, asked back with a playful expression.

Copying that playful look, the middle-aged man shrugged.

“Since I’ve been at your side ever since you were born, I have served you for thirty years.”

“Yeah. You are right.”

Nodding his head, Clyde looked at the three cards again.

“Goden.”

At Clyde’s call, the middle-aged man, Goden, came closer.

“Yes. Master Clyde.”

“I believe……”

Hesitating the end of his words, Clyde picked up a card amongst the three cards.

“The next king will be this person.”

“I’m not sure. I simply trust and follow Master Clyde’s decision.”

He was honest.

Even until now, Goden didn’t doubt Clyde’s decision even once.

Looking at Goden, Clyde made a smile.

A confident and satisfied expression.

He shook the card in his hand.

“So I’m planning to invest in this person’s faction, but……”

He hesitated his words.

He put down the card he was holding up.

The smile disappeared and the expression once again turned serious.

“A variable appeared.”

Goden made a bitter smile at those words.

“Do you mean Baron Tale?”

Clyde nodded his head instead of answering.

His gaze turned back to the three cards on the table.

On the three cards, the names Simon, Tommy, and Kallum were each written.

“Is Baron Tale an influential enough person to change the throne’s successor? No, can he become such a person?”

It wasn’t a question directed at anyone.

Muttering to himself, Clyde fell deep into contemplation.

With the tip of his finger, he touched Simon’s card.

Goden simply stared at that scene without a word.

After an unknown amount of time.

“Huu.”

Clyde let out a long sigh.

With the tip of his finger, he pushed Simon’s card away.

“As expected, I should go with my original decision.”

Clyde picked up a card amongst the other two.

“However I think about it, the person who will become the next king is this person.”

“I simply trust and follow Master Clyde’s decision.”

Goden repeated the words he said before.

Clyde intensely stared at the card he picked up.

“Goden.”

“Yes.”

“Please collect all the spare funds in the company. I’m personally going to the palace.”

“Understood.”

Goden exited the office as he answered.

Clyde, who was left alone, was still staring at the card he was holding.

‘It should be a good decision, right?’

It certainly wasn’t a decision based on instinct.

Based on all the information he had gathered, he selected the card with the highest possibility.

But there was one thing that continued to bother him.

“Baron Roan Tale.”

One of his eyes thinly closed.

“Just where did you pop out from?”

A humorous voice.

But his face, at least, was humorless.

“Running about any more than this is no good. Because the merchants like me……”

A cold air hung from the tip of his eyes.

“Really don’t like losing.”

*****

“Oh! Baron Tale. Welcome.”

The middle-aged man who handsomely grew out a moustache brightly smiled and opened his two arms.

Roan quickly dismounted from the horse and lowered his head.

“It is an honor to meet you. Sir Viscount Holten.”

The middle-aged man was Viscount Anthony Holten, the very man who sent Roan the invitation to the hunting competition.

“An honor…… hahaha. I’m the one honored to meet the hero of the expedition.”

The two shook hands and exchanged simple greetings.

Looking at the nobles and the knights behind Anthony, Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘If you all openly let out hostility like that, that dark plan of yours would be recognized.’

It was a point where the Amaranth Information Squad’s report wasn’t needed.

The nobles’ gaze toward Roan was that sharp and cold.

“Now, let me introduce the guests who will be enjoying the hunt with us today.”

One by one, Anthony introduced the nobles who wordlessly stood and were completely unaware of Roan’s thought.

“It is an honor to meet you.”

For each and every time, Roan greeted in a very polite and courteous manner.

At least, it seemed like that to Anthony and the other nobles.

“Should we then go to the hunting field?”

Anthony, who finished the introductions, asked with a subtle expression.

“Let us go, then.”

“Let us depart quickly.”

Several nobles hurried others and got on the horses’ saddles.

Roan also nodded instead of answering and grabbed the horse’s reins.

“Uurat!” 1

Anthony led the House’s knights and departed first.

The nobles who were glancing at Roan immediately followed behind Anthony, and as expected, they were each accompanied by three or four knights.

‘The knights are…… at amateur levels.’

Since he checked with Kalian’s Tears, it was certain.

Roan snickered and kicked the horse.

Unlike the other nobles, he brought just one subordinate.

And even then, he was a subordinate who was quite unlike a knight.

“Sir Baron. Isn’t the number too big for trappers?” 2

The one who asked him with a worried expression was Harrison.

Looking at Viscount Holten House’s soldiers following behind, he creased his forehead.

Roan faintly smiled at those words and shook his head.

“Don’t worry.”

A confident voice.

A self-assured attitude.

“Because our preparations are perfect.”

A Good Person (3) End.

Chapter 117




Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter.

“Hunting competition?”

“Yes. They say it’s a contest hosted by Viscount Holten.”

Simon, who was reviewing the future plans with his faction, made a surprised expression at the unexpected report.

“Holten? By Holten, you mean……?”

The expression turned sour.

Viscount Tio Ruin, who made the report, nodded as he bitterly smiled.

“Yes. He is Viscount Anthony Holten, who is supporting Prince Tommy.”

“Hmm.”

Simon let out a quiet sigh.

Carefully checking Simon’s expression, Tio cautiously spoke.

“It seems that Baron Tale participated without knowing.”

Simon made a strange expression at those words.

Glancing at the papers in his hand, he shook his head.

“I don’t know. Baron Tale shouldn’t be such a neglectful person……’

Simon murmured in a quiet voice.

During the Poskein Monster Expedition, Roan didn’t miss a single location or path of the monsters and completely comprehended everything.

There was no way that he wouldn’t find out which prince the noble was supporting and what kind of personality the noble had while accepting that noble’s invitation.

‘There’s no reason for Baron Tale to side with Tommy in this situation……’

In the end, it meant that he participated in Anthony’s hunting competition for a different reason.

‘He’ll do fine on his own.’

Simon trusted Roan.

No, instead, he wanted to give him power.

“Viscount Ruin.”

“Yes. Prince.”

Tio slightly lowered his head.

Reviewing the contents of the papers, Simon spat out an order.

“Give Roan a good bow. Since it’s a nobles’ hunting competition, he can’t just use a cheap infantry bow.”

“Yes. I shall do so.”

Tio brightly smiled and moved his feet toward the exit.

‘Thankfully, it seems he doesn’t doubt Baron Tale.’

His heart felt lighter than before.

At that moment, he heard Simon’s voice once again.

“Ah! ” Isn’t there an excellent archer amongst the guys that Roan has?

“Yes. He probably has a rank called the hundred-man commander.”

Because the words hundred-man commander didn’t flow from his mouth very well, Tio made an awkward smile.

Truthfully, the peculiar troop organization of the Amaranth troop was already a big topic amongst many nobles.

Some young nobles copied Roan and imitated him, but most nobles thought of it as useless work and disliked it.

“Give him one as well.”

“Yes. I shall do so.”

Tio once again bowed his head.

The reason he served Simon.

It was because of this point.

The manner in which he doesn’t ask about one’s status as long as that person was talented.

‘If his personality becomes a little softer, he will become a magnificent king.’

Tio grabbed the door’s handle.

‘The God’s Drug. We just need to obtain the God’s Drug.’

If so, Simon could eliminate the evil energy of the mana technique that Simon was training in.

If he could do that, he wouldn’t have to lose his rationality and go on a rampage even if he became angry.

‘Sir Duke Webster. Please.’

The one getting the God’s Drug was Simon’s grandfather on his mother’s side, Bradley Webster’s mission.

Tio exhaled a short sigh and exited the conference hall.

Simon glanced at Tio’s back and faintly smiled.

‘Viscount Ruin. I can see you worrying about me all over your face. Huhuhu.’

Somehow, he felt proud.

A loyal subordinate who worried about him day and night.

‘If only there were more people like Viscount Ruin, there wouldn’t be any need to get angry.’

A bitter smile formed on his mouth.

Instead of within himself, Simon was still searching for the root of all the faults elsewhere.

*****

‘Roan Tale.’

Glancing at Roan, who was following behind, Anthony gritted his teeth.

‘You will die here today.’

The friendly looking face was gone as if it were a lie.

A cold animosity floated in his eyes and mouth.

‘Those Janis guys. They’re so praiseworthy.’

Anthony and the Janis information agency’s relationship.

It started when he suspected his wife’s affairs.

For Anthony, who was a noble of the kingdom and a wealthy man, the Janis information agency wholeheartedly gathered evidence.

In the end, Anthony’s suspicion was found to be a misunderstanding, and his love and trust in his wife became much stronger from his guilt.

With that event as the catalyst, Anthony came to really like the Janis information agency and didn’t hold back in giving monetary support.

Especially once the three princes of the Rinse Kingdom began competing for the succession of the throne, Anthony and the Janis information agency’s relationship became even closer.

It was because Anthony needed the information on the other princes once he entered Tommy Rinse’s faction.

‘Each and every bit of information they provided was helpful.’

Thanks to that, he was able to rise to a position where he could converse privately with Tommy despite being a mere viscount.

If Tommy became the next king just like that.

‘I can become a count, no, at least a marquis.’

It was a situation where only the opportunities to ascend existed.

But Anthony’s path was blocked by a dark cloud.

The cause was the Poskein Monster Expedition.

Simon, the first prince, managed to raise overwhelming results in this expedition.

Thanks to that, the competition for the throne, which was proceeding tightly until now, had slightly leaned towards Simon.

And on top of this, the fact that the second prince, Tommy, tried to kill Simon was revealed and his position became highly volatile.

Anthony became desperate.

A scheme, an event, or an accident that could turn the situation around was needed.

A chance for Tommy to stop Simon’s rampage and rebound back.

But sadly, he couldn’t easily find such a chance nor did it come to him easily.

And at that time, Baba of the Janis information agency discreetly came to him at a late hour.

‘Baron Tale, they asked me to get rid of him.’

Baba said that Roan was gaining control of the Miller Castle’s information.

If the situation continued to proceed, Anthony couldn’t be provided with valuable information and Simon, who was on a winning streak, would monopolize the information of the entire region around the capital.

‘I can’t let that happen.’

Also.

‘If we look at the facts, the reason Prince Simon was able to raise the overwhelming results were all because of this guy, Roan.’

And the one who saved Simon’s life was him too.

If only there wasn’t Roan, Simon would have lost his life in the expedition’s battlefield and the throne would have been Tommy’s to take.

At least, that’s what Anthony thought.

In the end, Anthony decided to take Baba’s proposal after some contemplation.

Putting his head together with Baba, he came up with a plan.

The so-called Roan assassination plan using a hunting competition.

‘It is in fact a hunt, but a hunt for Roan rather than animals.’

A vile and foul smile hung on his mouth.

When they were planning the hunting competition conspiracy, Baba boasted with the Janis information agency’s name on the line.

‘Once I kill that bastard Roan, the Janis information agency promised to disguise it as an accident.’

In preparation for that, they had already set up traps in the hunting grounds.

They weren’t just simple deep holes.

The traps were made so that the earth will fall down from the left and the right once he stepped on the weeds covering the hole, and sharp swords and spears were planted upside down inside.

In name, they were traps to catch the bears that appeared around the region.

Roan would step on the bear trap during the hunting competition and suffer an untimely death.

And if he didn’t die even after falling into the trap?

‘Then we’ll have to personally use our hands.’

Because of that, the knights and the territory’s soldiers, as well as nobles who were close to him, all accompanied him.

Of course, the nobles that came along were all those who supported Tommy.

‘It certainly is a dangerous plan.’

But the reward for success was just as incredible as the danger.

‘If we can at least catch Roan, Prince Simon’s faction will fall into total chaos.’

At that time, Tommy simply had to calm the faction’s internal strife and prepare to fly once again.

Anthony thinly closed his eyes.

‘Once this job goes well, I too will fly.’

His heart thumped.

It felt as if a brilliant future was spreading out in front of his eyes.

Then.

Jing! Jing! Jing! Ddung! Ddung! Ddung!

The sounds of cymbals and drums loudly echoed.

“Waaaah!”

Soon after, the soldiers, who had the role of trappers, yelled and sprinted out.

Paat!

Through the tall weeds, a nimble deer showed itself.

Dodging the trappers, it frantically moved back and forth.

The hunting competition had finally begun.

“Who has the courage to go and catch that deer?”

When Anthony loudly shouted, a knight that was nearby, went up.

“I, Ted Weiss, will attempt to hit it once.”

As a knight of Viscount Holten’s house, Ted was famous for his exceptional archery skills.

‘Good. Then should I discourage Baron Tale a bit here? Huhuhu.’

Anthony wanted to boast about his subordinate’s skill.

At the same time, he wanted to show the bumpkin from the Kingdom’s eastern countryside that the capital wasn’t an easy place.

“Oh! Good. Ted. You go and take a shot.”

“Yes sir!”

Once Anthony’s permission was granted, Ted quickly pulled his bowstring.

Piing!

Soon, an arrow flew across the air with a sharp sound.

A beautiful curve.

Puuck!

A frightening sound echoed.

The deer that was running away from the trappers immediately fell down.

The arrow was stuck precisely in the deer’s neck.

“It’s a bulls-eye!”

A soldier loudly shouted.

“Hahaha! As expected, you live up to your reputation!”

“If it’s Ted Weiss of Viscount Holten’s house, he is quite the well-known archer in the capital.”

“Sir Viscount Holten must feel quite confident.”

With surprised expressions, many nobles clapped.

Slapping Ted’s shoulder, Anthony nodded his head.

“Hahaha. Certainly, I do feel confident.”

Ted slightly lowered his head at those words.

Then, a noble looked at Roan and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Rather than just doing this, Sir Baron Tale too, please show us your skills. I would like to see the skills of the expedition’s hero.”

“Yes. Let us see.”

“I want to see too.”

Insistence as if staged.

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘They probably plan on ridiculing me if I make a mistake here.’

But he had no plans to go along with the play.

With a cheerful smile, he answered in a leisurely manner.

“I’m a spearman, so I simply don’t have confidence with a bow.”

Of course, it was a lie.

His archery skills were certainly lacking compared to his spearmanship, but he held archery skill that was definitely above that of an ordinary soldier.

But to break off the noses of these arrogant nobles and knights, an overwhelming skill that was incredible even if one were to see it was needed.

‘Rather than an ordinary archer, this is when a godly one is needed.’

If it was a godly archer, incidentally, there was one nearby.

Roan moved to the side.

“He is the Hundred-man Commander, Harrison of the Amaranth troop.”

His right hand pointed at Harrison.

Harrison, who was quickly watching the situation unfold, instantly understood Roan’s intentions.

He quietly held the bow and took out an arrow.

A relaxed look and manner

Seeing that sight, Roan faintly smiled.

“He is our troop’s best archer.”

As soon as he spoke, he heard someone snort.

“Hmph.”

When he looked back at the sound, the knight, Ted, was making a haughty expression.

He looked at Harrison’s bow and shook his head.

“I’m worried that the bow would break from old age.”

A clearly mocking tone.

“Yes. It’s simply too old.”

“And the bowstring is much too coarse.”

“I wonder if the arrow would fall down in front of our feet instead. Hahaha.”

Many nobles chimed in and delighted themselves.

Roan creased his forehead.

He could take ridicule as much as possible if they were directed at him.

But he couldn’t take ridicule towards his subordinate.

There was already a case in the past when a similar event happened and he beat up Jack, his senior officer, to a pulp.

Roan was about to shout something back.

“Sir.”

Harrison softly smiled and shook his head.

A sign that he was okay.

At that moment.

“A deer!”

The trappers shouted.

Pabaat!

A deer showed up crossing through the weeds.

As expected, it moved frantically.

Harrison calmly held his breath and drew the bowstring.

Kigigigik. Ping!

As quick as the bow had been drawn, the string was released.

A rapid fire.

It was an archery as if aiming was unnecessary.

Sswaeaeaeaeaeg! 1

A sharp sound rocked the ears.

Roan as well as everyone else’s eyes chased the arrow.

Puuk!

The arrow perfectly planted itself into the deer’s body.

“It’s a bulls-eye!”

The soldiers loudly shouted.

Immediately, Anthony and many other nobles’ faces turned strange.

That was a look as if forcefully holding back a laughter.

“An excellent skill. It did hit the deer.”

“Ted Weiss here hit the deer’s neck, but that soldier over there hit the wide body.”

At the nobles’ praises, Ted’s shoulder went up a palm higher.

With an arrogant face, he looked back at Roan and Harrison.

“As expected, the difference between the capital and the countryside can’t be……”

When he spoke up to that point.

Ping! Ping! Piing!

Like when he shot the first arrow, Harrison consecutively fired several more arrows without aiming.

“Wha, what?”

The nobles and the knights looked at the arrow with a surprised expression.

Puk! Puk! Pupuk!

Four arrows planted themselves into the deer’s body in a blink.

Immediately, a heavy silence spread out.

The soldiers acting as trappers, Anthony and the nobles, and Ted with the rest of the knights all opened their eyes widely in shock and made faces that seemed to doubt what had happened.

Only two people.

Only Roan and Harrison looked at each other and smiled.

“They, they’re all bulls-eyes!”

A soldier shouted a moment late.

Only then did the suffocating silence break.

“Just, just how does, that, that skill……”

“Is that really possible?”

The nobles who were ridiculing Harrison were blown away.

In particular, Anthony received an incredible shock.

“To think that the four arrows fired later would hit the first arrow……”

He couldn’t even finish his sentence.

His sight was still on the deer’s fallen body that was far away.

There were total of five arrows planted in the deer’s body.

The shocking thing was that all five arrows were planted in an area smaller than a thumb’s nail.

In fact, one arrow had exactly pierced through an arrow that was shot before it.

“I feel rather envious of Baron Tale.”

“You said it. To have such an incredible archer as a subordinate……”

A few nobles couldn’t hide their envy inside and praised Harrison.

That was a kind of instinct.

At that moment.

“Impossible!”

Knight Ted thunderously shouted.

Glaring straight into Harrison’s eyes, he gritted his teeth.

“This is your real skill?”

At those words, Harrison glanced at Roan and then looked back at Ted.

Harrison slowly shook his head.

“It is not.”

As soon as he said so, Ted cynically smiled.

“Hmph! As expected. This can’t be your skill.” 2

“Yes. You’re right.”

Harrison nodded his head and held up his old bow.

“If only the bow was intact, I would have pierced through all the arrows.”

A sincerely disappointed look and voice.

“Wha, what?”

Immediately, Ted’s face burned red.

As if he were to immediately jump at Harrison, his entire body trembled.

“You bastard, you dare to make fun of me? For a worthless country bumpkin, you……”

When he spoke up to that point.

Paat!

A heavy sound rang through his ears.

At the same time, a black iron pole appeared.

Tuk!

The end of the iron pole touched Ted’s neck.

“Stop right there.”

A cold voice.

The one holding the iron pole was in fact Roan.

“From this point on, it would be best if you shut your mouth.”

The identity of the iron pole was the Travias Spear.

“Just, just what is……?”

Ted turned his head with a shocked expression.

Ssk.

The Travias Spear pressed down on the tip of his jaw.

“I told you that you should shut your mouth. If you flap that mouth one more time, I will break your jawbone.”

A even colder voice than before.

“Hhmph!”

Unknowingly, Ted instinctively closed his mouth with his two hands.

It was because he understood that Roan wasn’t joking.

“Ba, Baron Tale. Why are you suddenly doing this?”

At the unexpected situation, Anthony awkwardly smiled and shook his hand.

While glaring at Ted, Roan briefly answered.

“Ted Weiss looked down upon and ridiculed my subordinate.”

Strength went into his voice.

“An insult to my subordinate is in turn, an insult to me.”

Gigik.

Travias Spear became a little longer.

Roan turned his head and looked at Anthony.

“The only ones who stay quiet after being insulted are cowards.”

Good Person 4 End.

Chapter 118




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Sorry about the late release. There were some issues we had to resolve.

“Hm. So he is currently hunting with Viscount Holten?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

With a slightly nervous expression, Baba answered.

“It’s not bad, but…”

The glasses man on the chair rubbed his chin.

Baba unconsciously took a dry gulp.

A timid look that didn’t match his big size.

He was that afraid of the glasses man, Hooke, the master of the Janis Information Agency and the best information agent in Miller Castle, who was in front of him.

“Hm.”

With a sharp light shining in his eyes, Hooke fiddled with his glasses’ frame.

It was one of his habits that came out whenever he was contemplating or was deep in thought.

A moment later.

“And if the plan goes wrong and Viscount Holten fails?”

Did he perhaps expect the question?

Baba immediately answered.

“We will cut off our tail.”

“Cut off our tail?”

“Yes. We have already cleaned up the articles and records related to the plan. If the plan goes wrong, we will immediately dispose of them.”

An immediate answer.

A confident face.

Only then did Hooke show a look that was slightly relieved.

But there were still many other things that needed to be checked.

“There are a significant number of nobles that hold a close relationship with us. Among them are counts as well as marquises and dukes.”

Baba nodded instead of answering.

He too had clearly memorized the Janis Information Agency’s list of customers.

The big shot nobles whose names he wouldn’t dare to mention lightly.

“What’s your reason for leaving them alone and choosing Viscount Holten instead?”

With an expression that seemed to emphasize how obvious the answer was, Baba replied.

“There is the advantage of him being easier to control than other big nobles, but most of all, Viscount Holten’s ambition is big. He is……”

His expression turned strange.

That was a certain kind of sneer.

“A man who wouldn’t even refuse a poisoned apple for success.”

It was true.

In the case of higher nobles who had already achieved much and had much to lose, there was no need for them to risk danger for a greater success.

But those like Anthony, whose ambitions were grand despite being in an ambiguous standing, wanted to accomplish big achievements even if they had to overextend themselves.

And because Baba recognized that and threw out the bait, Anthony had immediately bitten it.

Making a foul smile, Hooke nodded his head.

“Well, that’s probably why he’s thoughtlessly jumping at a shabby plan like this. Kuk.”

A sneer leaked out.

“And the reactions from the princes?”

It was a fact that most nobles, no, almost all residents of Miller knew that Roan was on Prince Simon’s side and Anthony was on Prince Tommy’s side.

It was highly possible that the princes would take some kind of action.

Baba answered with a slightly nervous look.

“Surprisingly, there is no reaction. It seems that all three princes are watching the situation.”

“Really? I wasn’t sure about the other princes, but I thought that there would some reaction from Prince Simon’s faction……”

Hooke made a surprised expression.

However much the Janis Information Agency held and controlled Miller Castle’s information, it obviously didn’t know very much about the situation inside the palace.

“Anyhow, I quite like how you handled the work this time.”

Hooke looked at Baba and nodded his head.

Only then did a look of relief appear on Baba’s face.

‘He’s doing it again.’

Hooke didn’t miss that change in Baba’s face.

Frowning his nose, he asked in a small voice.

“The spies on Baron Tale are still properly attached, right?”

“Yes. They have continued to bring various information until now.”

Baba nodded his head with a confident face.

“This time, if the plan goes wrong, they must spy on him more thoroughly. If he shows even a small suspicious movement, tell them to report immediately.”

“Yes. I understand.”

Baba answered with a slightly nervous look.

It was a brief movement, but his expressions changed too often.

Hooke tried to say something, but soon afterwards waved his hand instead.

A sign telling him to now leave.

Lowering his head, Baba bowed and exited the office.

Hooke, who was left alone, bit down on his lower lip.

‘Baba. I was planning on making him the agency’s next master since he received quite a lot of the members’ support and had good talent, but……’

It seems he had to change his thought.

‘He is too young and soft. His vicious side is lacking.’

The heart was too weak to carry the group.

At his single expression and word, Baba repeated being delighted, nervous, and afraid.

‘It seems that I have to look for a new guy.’

Hooke planned to slowly increase the Janis Information Agency’s size.

His ambition was certainly great.

But whether his talent was enough to follow that ambition was unknown.

*****

‘Dammit.’

Viscount Anthony gritted his teeth.

‘Even though we haven’t even gotten to where the traps are.’

He didn’t expect Roan to possibly take out a spear in front of nobles.

Of course, the nobles of that era weren’t the type to look away from insolence.

An era when honor was highly held up.

However, Anthony thought that Roan, who only recently became a noble, would remain docile.

And just like that, he hadn’t understood Roan properly.

If he was someone who had watched Roan until now, he absolutely wouldn’t have ridiculed or mocked Roan’s subordinates.

“Baron Tale.”

Forcing a smile, Anthony shook his hands.

“Ted simply made a mistake because his personality is a bit rash, so please kindly forgive him.”

For now, he had to calm Roan down.

‘Only then could I drop him into the trap, kill him, and cover it up as an accident or whatnot.’

But Roan’s expression was still cold.

“I’ll have to get an apology.”

“Yes. Of course he’ll have to apologize.”

Anthony immediately nodded his head and signaled towards Ted with his eyes.

Ted deeply bowed towards Roan.

“I’m sorry. I have shown you a bad side of……”

When he spoke up to that point.

“Stop.”

Roan shook his head and stopped him.

He pointed at Harrison with his chin.

“You should be apologizing to Harrison instead of me.”

“Hmm.”

Ted gritted his teeth.

To Roan, who was a noble, he could lower his head as many times as needed.

But that was different for Harrison.

‘I have to lower my head to the commoner bastard?’

He was a knight.

And even though it was only an honorary title that couldn’t be passed down, he had the title of a baronet. 1

He couldn’t lower his head to Harrison.

But.

‘Damn it. If it only wasn’t for the planned trap……’

For now, appeasing Roan came first.

Most of all, Anthony kept on sending him signs with his eyes right in front of him.

An urgently pressing look.

‘Dammit. Kuuk.’

Inevitably, Ted lowered his head slightly toward Harrison.

His face had blushed and was contorted.

“I, I’m sorry. I became excited and said too much.”

Harrison looked at Ted with a calm face, who was lowering his head at him.

But truthfully, he was greatly anxious inside.

And at the same time, he felt a thrilling exhilaration.

‘That prideful and arrogant knight bowed his head.’

And to him, who was a commoner.

It was a sight he wouldn’t had even dared to imagine.

Of course.

‘It’s probably to calm down my lord for now.’

Harrison, too, had a complete grasp of their scheme.

With a cough, he slightly raised his hand.

“It’s okay.”

As soon as he said so, Ted immediately raised his head up high.

His face was still brightly blushing.

Glancing at Roan and Anthony once, he returned to his original place.

His entire body trembled from the humiliation.

If he could, he wanted to immediately draw his sword.

‘I’ll wait just a bit, just a bit more.’

Once Roan and Harrison fell into the traps, he planned to stab the sword into their bodies.

Then, he heard Anthony’s voice.

“Really, that rash personality is quite troublesome. Hahaha.”

Anthony deliberately laughed aloud and changed the mood.

“Shall we continue the hunt?”

He signaled with his eyes to the nobles that came along.

The nobles, who became scared at Roan’s pressure and were reading the mood, soon noticed and nodded their heads.

“Yeah. That should be good.”

“There are only deer here, so why don’t we go a bit more towards the east?”

A conversation that naturally flowed.

There wasn’t a single part that was strange.

But inwardly, Roan was making a bitter smile.

‘So they’re suggesting to go towards the traps.’

He too had no need to specifically refuse.

That place was already Roan’s, not Anthony’s, territory.

Roan looked at Anthony and the nobles and nodded.

“Then, let us go east.”

*****

Paat!

An extremely crumpled piece of paper hit a wall and bounced off.

“So he is going to come at me like that……”

The man panting and raging was Baron Elton Coat.

“I betrayed Prince Simon because I trusted Prince Kallum, but…… he’s saying that I’m no longer needed now that the job is done? Hmph!” 2

The ball of paper Elton threw was a letter from Kallum.

After betraying Simon and placing himself in danger, Elton’s position became extremely dangerous.

He ran away from Simon for now and returned to his land in the north, but not knowing when he might be subjugated, he passed the days in fear.

With a sense of grasping at straws, he kept sending letters to Kallum, but Kallum didn’t even reply back once.

Also during that time, Baron Gary Renard, who betrayed Simon together with Elton, liquidated his assets and his territory, and ran away to the Byron Kingdom.

As the situation turned for the worst, Elton sent a final letter to Kallum.

No, it was more blackmail than a letter.

Was it thanks to that? Finally, Kallum’s reply came.

“Kuk. We have never talked and have never met before?”

Coldly and cruelly, Kallum cut Elton off.

Elton loudly grinded his teeth.

‘If I knew this was going to happen, I should’ve just followed Prince Simon.’

Regret poured in much too late.

At that moment, Tony the vice captain of the territory’s army, who was standing by at a corner, spoke up in a cautious manner.

“My lord?”

“What!”

Elton reacted in a fit of anger.

Tony was slightly startled, but didn’t back down.

He too was in a corner as expected. 3

“Since it has come to this, why don’t we try to scheme up something big?”

“Something big?”

Elton creased his forehead.

He looked straight into Tony’s two eyes.

‘For someone with such a large stature, his head is quite exceptional and quick at understanding the situation.’

Because of that, Tony became his close aide despite not even being the captain of the territory’s army, but a mere vice captain.

Back in the Poskein Monster Expedition, he also made the achievement of convincing Simon to go out on his own.

Seeing Elton’s expression slowly soften, Tony inwardly cheered in success.

Quickly, he laid out his plan.

“Right now, there is nowhere in Rinse Kingdom that we can lean towards. Prince Simon won’t forgive us and Prince Kallum has abandoned us.”

“Don’t say what we already know.”

With an awkward look, Elton shook his head.

Tony nodded and quickly continued to talk.

“And even if we were to seek asylum with the Byron Kingdom, there is already Sir Baron Gary Renard who went first, so there is no chance for us to receive a good reception.”

“Get to the point, the point.”

At the continued explanation of the situation, Elton creased his brows.

With a quiet voice, Tony spoke as if to whisper.

“My suggestion is to go over to the Byron Kingdom while bringing a big present.”

“A big present?”

When Elton asked back, Tony pointed with his finger towards the ground.

“If it’s Coat Baronnie and Renard Baronnie, wouldn’t that be an amazingly big present?”

Suddenly, Elton’s eyes turned wide.

A strange silence fell in the office.

“Khm.”

Tony shrugged and let out a cough.

Only then did Elton gather himself and nodded.

“Do continue. I’ll hear it for now and then decide.”

He pretended to be calm, but his voice shook.

The tip of his mouth kept on twitching.

*****

At the eastern edge of the hunting ground, the grass had grown waist-high and a dense forest spread out.

Anthony rode a step ahead of the others and checked the inside of the hunting grounds.

‘Hm. It’s properly marked.’

A symbol only he himself, the knights, and the soldiers who took on the role of trappers, could recognize.

There, the traps were set.

With a faint smile on his mouth, Anthony turned to Roan and the nobles.

“This place is famous for La’bear to appear.”

“Oh! La’bear.”

“Finally, I feel like doing some hunting.”

Many nobles cheered and were delighted.

La’bear was a type of a special species of bear that only lived in Rinse Kingdom.

Although it was smaller than a normal bear, it was much faster and more agile, and had extremely hard skin.

And because there was a limit to hunting it with a regular arrow, one must use spears, swords, axes and such to fight in close quarters.

‘And because of it, it’s much more dangerous than other types of hunting.’

But it was a hunt where one could feel an equally sharp exhilaration.

Roan looked at the hunting ground and smiled.

‘We’ll have to run around over there if we want to hunt La’bear, but……’

In there, unseen traps had been set all over.

Of course.

‘We already changed all their locations.’

The smile that hung his mouth became deeper.

Anthony, who wouldn’t know of this situation at all, was excited on his own.

‘For now, we’ll free a La’bear that we had tied in the forest, and……’

For this trap, he had even prepared a La’bear.

And just in case the La’bear could step on the traps, they had spread the Vetto flower, a flower that the bear seriously hated, on top of the traps in bunches .

‘And if Baron Tale stepped on the trap while chasing the La’bear……’

If so, it would be a complete success.

But there still was the most important problem.

‘Baron Tale must be the first to hunt.’

Although they had marked the spots, Anthony, as well as the other nobles, could easily fall into the traps and get hurt while frantically running around.

‘How should I do it?’

When he was contemplating just how to naturally make him hunt.

At that moment.

Kueong!

With a loud cry, a La’bear ran out from the forest.

‘Those idiotic bastards! What are you trying to do releasing it already when there wasn’t a signal?!’

Anthony panicked and creased his brows.

Even though he hadn’t even passed the first hunt to Roan, the La’bear had shown itself first.

‘Uug! If something goes wrong, the plan will be ruined! Idiots!’

When Anthony was cursing the soldiers in charge of the La’bear.

“Sir Viscount Holten.”

He heard Roan’s voice.

Forcefully hiding his annoyed expression, Anthony looked at him.

Roan cheerfully smiled and lifted the Travias Spear.

“I haven’t had much to show off during the deer hunt, so may I take the first hunt for the La’bear?”

“Oh!”

Anthony exclaimed.

That was not a false exclamation.

‘What luck!’

The twisted situation untwisted itself on its own.

‘I have a good feeling this time!’

It felt as if lady luck was following him.

Anthony immediately nodded his head.

“To be able to see the skills of Sir Baron Tale, the hero of the expedition…… I wish to ask of you instead.”

“Then, I’ll take it as your permission.”

Roan brightly smiled and lowered his head.

Soon afterwards, he pulled the reins and kicked his horse.

Hihihiing!

The war horse wildly cried out and kicked the ground.

The place he was heading to was the field that the La’bear was running around.

Anthony’s face became greatly flushed looking at that scene.

‘He’s going. Go!’

Things were really going great.

The war horse carrying Roan ran toward the trap he had dug.

‘Just a bit, just a bit more.’

Anthony’s face turned serious.

The knights and the many nobles who knew of the situation all gazed at Roan and made dry gulps.

Finally.

Teodeog!

The war horse carrying Roan stepped on top of the trap.

“Good! We……”

Anthony unknowingly clenched his fist and shouted but soon shut his mouth.

Dududududu!

That was because the war horse that landed on top of the trap was still running toward the La’bear as if nothing had happened.

Anthony widely opened his eyes and looked at the people around him.

A look that showed complete confusion.

But that was the same for the other people.

Looks of panic were clear on their faces.

Meanwhile.

Dududududu!

Roan’s war horse stepped back and forth over the places where the traps were and where they weren’t, and ran on.

And the people who hoped each time for Roan to get hurt fell into great confusion.

Anthony wanted to shout out in frustration, but he couldn’t due to Harrison.

‘Damn it! Just what is happening?! What is happening!’

The two eyes widely opened to the point of being ripped open.

He clenched his teeth and sharply trembled with his entire body.

‘Were the traps incorrectly marked?’

Anthony grilled the knights and nobles with his eyes.

But sadly, the ones who knew the answer weren’t them.

‘How foolish.’

Harrison, who was watching the scene, inwardly smiled.

Looking at Anthony, who was laboriously making a smile at him, Harrison twitched his nose.

‘Welcome.’

His heart calmed down.

‘To the battlefield we have prepared.’

Chapter 119




Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter.

Update: corrected “viscountess” Elva to “baroness” Elva. Also corrected “Viscount Sith” to “Baron Sith”.

“Certainly, we should bring him in, right?”

“Of course. There is no one like him that fits us so perfectly.”

Ten young men and two young women.

The twelve young people sat around a large round table and chatted pleasantly.

Their expressions were soft and the voices were quiet, but the mood was feverish.

“Alright. Then who should be the good person to persuade him?”

As soon as his words finished, everyone turned to one young woman.

“The eloquent Elva Dionell is perfect for this job.”

“If it’s Elva, I can trust and leave her the work.”

“Certainly, Elva has to do it.”

Gazes and praises poured down.

The young women, Elva, faintly smiled and nodded her head.

“Sure. I’ll have a go at it.”

A bold voice and manner that didn’t fit her innocent look.

She was merely twenty five years old, but was the head of the Dionell House and a baroness of Rinse Kingdom.

Including the Rinse Kingdom, several nations on the continent granted and allowed the inheritance of nobility to women. Of course, it wasn’t an easy job.

In the case of women, their talent must be more exceptional and there couldn’t be even a small fault.

Because of that, a female noble represented a great talent just by being a noble.

And amongst those female nobles, Elva was a talent amongst the talented who became a noble at the youngest age.

She looked around at the young men and women sitting around the round table.

Including her, every one of the twelve young people were between their twenties and early thirties.

All similar to each other, each one of them was the head of a household and were part of the kingdom’s nobility.

These twelve people represented the meeting of the young nobles that represented the Rinse Kingdom.

“Okay. Then we’ll leave the work of persuading Baron Tale to Elva.”

Sith Wiggins, the head of the group and a baron of the Rinse Kingdom, concluded the decision.

Turning to everyone, he continued to speak.

“As you all know, we 12 Hatchlings act as the youth party in the world of Rinse’s nobles. Although the princes we each support are different, regardless of who becomes the next king, we have to stay together and pledge our loyalty to the kingdom. Got it?”

Everyone nodded at those words.

“Of course. In the first place, that’s why we made this group.”

“That is obvious.”

“ We will do our best for the Rinse Kingdom and its people.”

A slightly excited voice.

Sith brightly smiled and nodded his head.

His heart felt proud.

‘It was quite hard to arrive at this point.’

When he first made the youth party called the Hatchling, their numbers were merely three.

Feeling disgust from the sight of traditional nobles’ arrogant, cliqued, indecisive and useless looks, Sith gathered young nobles with progressive and revolutionary minds and created the youth party.

Expanding the number of members while carefully checking each person’s personality and ability, their numbers had now reached twelve.

‘Would the thirteenth member be Baron Roan Tale?’

The man who was currently receiving the greatest attention.

If he joined the group, he would be a great strength to the group.

Sith’s gaze turned to Elva.

‘If it’s Elva, she should do well.’

Elva was one of the founding members of the Hatchling party along with him.

To the point where most members had joined due to her persuasion, she was a great persuasive speaker.

At that moment, Sith and Elva’s gazes met.

Staring at each other, the two faintly smiled.

‘Elva. I trust you.’

That was the meaning of Sith’s gaze.

However.

‘Ah…… my love, Sith.’

Elva’s gaze had a different meaning.

*****

Keueong!

A cry that shook the forest.

Twisting its neck, the La’bear cried aloud and soon fell down.

In its neck was a long and thick black spear.

The Travias Spear.

The black spear was definitely Roan’s favorite weapon, the Travias Spear.

“Huu.”

Roan let out a short sigh and pulled on the end of the spear.

The speartip that was buried deeply in the La’bear’s body showed itself.

‘To hunt a La’bear alone……’

Roan was once again surprised and shocked at himself.

There was also a time in his last life when he hunted a La’bear.

He was acting as a trapper for the generals’ pleasure hunting, when he was dragged in to personally hunt for their amusement.

‘Even though twenty common soldiers had to jump in and were barely able to catch one at that time.’

Literally a sense of being in a new world.

Roan bitterly smiled and shook the spearhead.

The La’bear’s blood on the spear’s tip sprayed out to the side.

“Wow……”

The common soldiers who were watching the sight from the side exclaimed with shocked faces.

They had also heard that Roan, the expedition’s hero, had amazing skills.

‘Even though he was merely a common soldier not too long ago.’

I thought that rumors tend to be exaggerated.’

‘I thought he merely caught Prince Simon’s eyes by luck and achieved baseless success.’

But the skills they saw from Roan in the flesh exceeded the rumors.

A slightly rough but fearless horse riding skills and flawless spearmanship.

Especially, even in the common soldiers’ eyes, Roan’s spearmanship was an exception amongst exceptions.

A feeling like looking at a whirlwind with neither a start nor an end.

The sight of Roan leading the war horse across the field chasing and killing the La’bear was the very definition of perfection.

The common soldiers, who had the role of trappers, stared at Roan in awe.

‘There was a time when I was like them too.’

Reminiscing of his past self, he pulled the reins.

‘You can’t simply stare and be awed. Work hard. If you try hard, you can be anything.’

In fact, Roan had been working himself to death throughout his entire second life.

He couldn’t really call his last life a success, thanks to the efforts made in that life, he could reach the light in the second life.

‘A nation where anything is possible with hard work. I will make that nation.’

Roan took in a deep breath.

His spirit soared.

Meanwhile, the horse had turned toward Viscount Holten and the various nobles.

Clop. Clop.

While everyone remained silent, only the sound of the horse’s steps rang out.

“My lord. That was quite an amazing skill.”

When Roan came close, Harrison raised his thumb as if he had been waiting.

Roan cheerfully smiled and shook his head.

“This much skill is nothing.”

His gaze headed naturally toward Anthony.

“I heard that Sir Viscount Holten’s swordsmanship was incredible. This time, please show us your awesome skills, sir viscount.”

“U, un?”

Anthony blanked out at the sudden request.

“M, me?”

At the repeated question, Roan lightly nodded his head.

Anthony awkwardly smiled and turned to the other nobles, but they too couldn’t do anything.

‘Damn it. Just what is happening?’

The markings for the traps were definitely done properly.

But in fact, there were no traps there.

No, there was no certain way to tell if they were there or not.

The number of traps Roan stepped on weren’t many.

It was unknown whether the traps in other places were properly set.

‘Damn it.’

In the end, there was only one method.

‘For now, I’ll avoid every single place marked as a trap.’

If so, he could at least avoid being completely humiliated.

While Anthony was turning his head and organizing his chaotic thoughts, he heard Roan’s voice.

“Then should I go and chase a La’bear here?”

Anthony was suddenly shocked and took ahold of himself at those words and shook his hand.

“No need. Let’s leave that to the trappers.”

If Roan went into the forest here, then the La’bears he had prepared in advance would be revealed.

Anthony hurriedly took out his sword and pulled his reins.

“Please don’t laugh even if it’s lacking.”

Relaxing while pretending to be humble, he kicked his horse.

Dudududu.

The war horse that showed off a smooth body crossed the field.

As if it had waited, a La’bear ran out from the forest.

‘For now, avoid everywhere marked as a trap.’

Anthony freely controlled the war horse.

As someone who was a noble from birth, his horse riding skills were quite exceptional.

Paat!

The war horse freely ran between the trap marks as if it was dancing.

Soon, the La’bear that was running wild came close enough to possibly touch.

‘I’ll cut this guy’s neck insta……’

When he had thought up to that point.

Psck!

With an unpleasant sound, his sight leaned to the right.

The horse’s body dangerously shook as if it would fall.

“Eh?”

Shocked, Anthony pulled hard at the reins.

But the horse couldn’t maintain its balance.

It was because the ground it was firmly stepping on had suddenly collapsed.

Kugung!

With a loud crash, the war horse carrying Anthony fell into the ground.

“Uuaaack!”

Anthony screamed at the sudden event.

Hihihing!

The war horse also cried out violently.

Kwajik!

From losing its balance and falling deep into the earth, the war horse’s leg was mercilessly broken.

Anthony also wasn’t looking so good.

His ankle and wrist were broken and he had received heavy bruising all over his body.

‘A, a trap? Why is a trap in this place!’

He had instinctively realized that he had fallen into a trap.

Anthony looked around the hole and shook his head.

‘This isn’t a trap we made.’

In the traps he made, sharp weapons like swords and spears were planted upside down.

But the place he had fallen in was simply a deep hole.

‘Why is this kind of trap……?’

Within his head, questions appeared one after the other.

But this was not the time to leisurely contemplate.

“Uhuph!”

Clumps of earth continuously fell down on his head.

Towards the entrance of the hole, he loudly yelled out.

“Save me! Hurry and get me out of here! Now!”

Anthony’s shout was clearly heard by the knights and the many nobles who were watching from the outside.

“My lord!”

Ted and the knights like him kicked their horses with hurried expressions.

The territory’s soldiers, who were working as trappers, quickly ran from the opposite field and the forest.

“It, it’s dangerous if you carelessly……”

Many nobles tried to shout with a worried look, but closed their mouths due to Roan’s presence.

Pretending to be oblivious, Roan made a serious face.

“It seems he fell into a bear trap. Let us all go and rescue Sir Viscount Holten.”

The nobles nodded their heads at those words and pulled on their reins with reluctant faces.

‘Damn it. There definitely wasn’t the trap mark, so why?’

‘What? Just where are the traps and where is safe?’

While heading toward Anthony, the nobles sharply focused their senses.

It was because they too couldn’t tell just where the traps were.

But to simply stand still, they couldn’t stand Roan’s gaze.

At that moment.

“U-ugh!”

“Uagh!”

“Ack!”

The knights and the territory’s soldiers fell into the hole with screams.

“Hph!”

“No way!”

The nobles who were further back nervously swallowed and stopped where they stood.

With expressions of complete fear, they couldn’t carelessly move.

‘Damn it. There are bear traps everywhere.’

‘Did Viscount Holten not even check for bear traps while setting this up?’

The nobles absolutely couldn’t imagine that the places Anthony, the knights, and the territory’s soldiers fell down into were traps that Roan prepared.

Looking at the nobles frozen like stone, Roan inwardly smiled.

‘You guys stay still just like that. From here on, this place is……’

When his thoughts proceeded to that point.

Ppuuuuu!

Sound of a horn echoed.

“Un?”

“What the?”

The nobles, who were already really tense, were startled in surprise and turned towards the source of the sound.

“Ah……”

Immediately, a quiet exclaim leaked out of everyone’s mouth.

Amaranth.

The ones who appeared with the horn from the edge of the field were the Amaranth troops.

Holding up their troop flag in front, they ran toward the nobles in a grand manner.

Roan smiled as he looked towards the Amaranth troops.

‘From here on, we the Amaranth troop control this place.’

*****

Austin was leading the Amaranth troop and was doing troop tactics training while circling Miller Castle’s outer wall.

It was an official training that got permission from the palace beforehand.

But the true purpose of the training was elsewhere.

‘ Obliterate Viscount Holten and his group’s scheme.’

The order from Roan.

Amaranth troop will be on standby at the eastern edge of the hunting ground. Once Viscount Anthony Holten and the subordinates under him fall into the trap, sound the horn and show yourselves. We……

Austin’s eyes flashed with light.

‘We will rescue those worthless bastards and find out all who are related to this event, so he said.’

Roan had no plan to immediately put down Anthony and the nobles.

‘However much he wanted to attract the prince’s attention, he couldn’t have planned such an idiotic and bold work alone.’

That was Roan’s thought.

There should definitely be someone who supported him from the shadows or helped architect the scheme.

Using this chance, Roan planned to pull out the factions that aimed against him from the root.

Austin led the troops around the hunting ground and headed towards Roan.

“My lord! Are you okay?”

A rather good acting.

Roan inwardly smiled and nodded.

“I’m fine. Why are you here?”

When he asked the question they planned in advance, Austin immediately answered.

“We got here while returning from our troop tactics training.”

“How fortunate. The situation here isn’t very good.”

Roan and Austin.

The two’s acting continued on.

At the Amaranth troop that suddenly appeared, the nobles, who couldn’t do anything in fear of falling into the traps, no, into the bear traps, were half out of their minds.

‘Thi, this is going badly in too many ways.’

‘One wrong move and we’ll be the ones that fall.’

Anthony and his subordinates had already fallen into the traps and they too couldn’t carelessly do anything.

If their scheme to somehow take down Roan was revealed, they would be caught helplessly by Roan and his Amaranth troop or die a dog’s death.

At that moment, Roan’s voice rang out.

“The noble sirs, please stay still over there just in case. Our Amaranth troop will search this field for the bear traps.”

“Do, do go ahead.”

The nobles merely nodded their heads.

Bitterly smiling on the inside, Roan looked at Austin.

“For now, the Amaranth troop should……”

When he spoke up to that point.

“No, there’s really no need for you to do that.”

He heard a familiar voice from behind the troop.

‘Hm?’

Tilting his head, Roan moved his gaze.

Instantly, a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

“You are……”

The young man who pushed the troops to the sides and appeared was in fact, Clay.

Smiling cheerfully, Clay walked towards Roan.

“Do you remember me?”

A clean look unlike when he met Roan.

It was a look that simply couldn’t be recognized with a casual glance.

But Roan clearly remembered Clay’s thin eyes and his peculiar atmosphere.

“Of course. Mr. Clay.”

“Ah! So you do remember me. And……”

Clay brightly smiled and turned towards the traps and the nobles who were frozen stiff.

“You clearly remembered my prediction too.”

A satisfied expression.

But soon, he slightly creased his forehead.

“But just what are you doing right now?”

Roan answered with a composed voice.

“I’m trying to rescue Sir Viscount Holten and his subordinates.”

Clay shook his head at those words.

“Sir Baron. If you want to pull out the root, you have to pull out the root, so why are you trying to pluck off the leaves and the stems?” 1

“Hmm.”

With a slightly surprised look, Roan swallowed back his exclamation.

‘He completely saw through my thoughts and plans.’

Clay was certainly not an ordinary young man.

Rubbing his right earlobe, Clay continued to speak.

“Let us go pull out some roots. I will……”

His thin eyes bent in a peculiar way.

“Guide you there.”

A confident voice spread with the wind.

Chapter 120




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Sorry about the lateness. I had my Psych final this week. I also have a math final next Tuesday, so the next chapter will probably be delayed to sometime on Wednesday. However, my summer vacation starts right after that, so I may be able to increase the number of releases per week.

Clay was confident.

He wanted Roan to be shocked by the abilities he had shown.

‘Only then would he treat me preciously.’

Clay looked at Roan.

‘Sir Baron Tale’s faction needs a genius like me.’

Around Roan, there were many skilled warriors as well as geniuses who could become skillful warriors.

However, he lacked civil officials who would help with administration or design military strategies and read the big picture.

No, he didn’t have anyone at all.

‘I shall fill that missing spot.’

That was Clay’s plan.

But sadly, he was making a big miscalculation.

Because he was overconfident about his abilities, he misjudged Roan’s situation.

Roan and his subordinates.

They were geniuses who were much more outstanding than what Clay had believed.

At that moment.

“Sure. Where will you take me?”

He heard Roan’s voice.

Roan was calm.

He didn’t show any doubt from Clay’s words.

With a slightly surprised face, Clay looked at Roan.

‘Does he believe my words?’

At most, this was their second meeting.

Although he did show an unusual talent, it wasn’t an easy thing to suddenly trust someone he had only met once before.

Because of that, he had prepared all sorts of things to say to persuade Roan beforehand.

‘It seems I won’t need them.’

Roan’s decision was extraordinary to a such degree.

‘He’s either bold or reckless.’

Clay stared straight into Roan’s eyes.

There wasn’t a bit of hesitation and only a look of complete trust in his decision.

‘I simply can’t grasp his thoughts.’

In his mind, Clay shook his head.

Truthfully, Roan’s decision this time was quite bold and reckless even for him.

However, he trusted his eyes that had grown from meeting Pierce, Chris, Harrison, Austin, Semi, Brian, and so on.

‘He had already predicted the current situation several days ago.’

Roan wasn’t sure just how much of the current situation Clay knew, but it was clear that he had at least completely grasped the big picture.

‘I can’t be embarrassed about accepting other people’s help.’

To accomplish even greater things, he needed help from a lot more people.

Roan wasn’t a genius and he was just a human who was lacking in many areas.

And so, he needed an ability to be able to judge talented people and put them in the right place.

‘Mr. Clay is someone who can be of great help to me.’

He felt certain of it.

Of course, being excessively confident and being overly prideful of his ability was something that needed to be changed.

‘If he learns of his shortcomings, he should become humble on his own.

Roan was confident that he could change Clay.

There were various kinds of geniuses around Roan, and they had increased their abilities by several levels with his help.

‘It will be a good opportunity for all of them.’

Seemingly unaware of Roan’s feeling, Clay whispered in a quiet voice.

“The place I will guide you to is the Janis information agency’s headquarters in Miller Castle.”

Watching Roan’s complexion, he continued to speak.

“They are the perpetrators who incited Viscount Holten and schemed this event. They are……”

For quite some time, Clay explained in detail about the scheme that the Janis information agency and Anthony Holten had planned.

It was a complete explanation without a single error as if he was an insider.

‘As expected, it was the Janis information agency……’

Roan mentally nodding his head as he listened to Clay’s explanation.

From the start, the Janis information agency was judged as one of the most likely masterminds of the event.

He had even ordered the Amarinth information agency to extensively spy on them due to their unusual movements.

‘But the fact that we couldn’t catch them must mean that their abilities are quite extraordinary.’

He didn’t particularly wish to blame Keep or the information squad.

‘But how did Mister Clay know of all this information?’

He momentarily felt suspicious.

All the while, Clay continued to talk.

“Most likely, they have mobilized their agents to watch the entire hunting grounds. By now, they must have realized that the plan went wrong and should be returning to the information agency’s headquarters to make their report.”

Clay’s voice became urgent.

“If we waste time here, the Janis information agency will run and disappear like a reptile cutting off its own tail. Therefore, we must attack their headquarters as soon as possible.”

Austin tilted his head at Clay’s words.

“Could a mere information agency really be the root of this event?”

He squinted his eyes.

Clay shook his head.

“They are merely rootlets. The true root is within the information they hold.”

The greatest information agency in the capital.

Inside, the information on Tommy Rinse, Kallum Rinse, and the nobles who followed them was meticulously stored.

Of course, the letters and the conversations that Anthony and the Janis information agency had shared were included amongst them.

Roan nodded his head.

Clay’s words were true.

‘Information is power.’

With his eyes, he signaled towards Austin.

Soon, Austin brought out a war horse.

“Can you ride a horse?”

Roan stared at Clay.

For an ordinary commoner, it was an impossible feat.

But Clay nodded his head with a calm face.

“Of course.”

A voice full of confidence.

And with a graceful movement, he got on the saddle.

It wasn’t the skills of a person who had only ridden once or twice before.

“Sir Baron Tale.”

Grabbing the reins, Clay called out to Roan.

“Before we attack their headquarters, there is something that we must do.”

“What is it?”

Roan was still composed.

That slightly agitated Clay.

‘Why is he so calm? Is he not satisfied with the abilities that I’ve shown?”

He thought that Roan would be extremely shocked and awed by now.

But throughout everything, Roan was composed and maintained a calm look.

‘He must be forcefully hiding his shock.’

Clay scrunched his nose and shook his head.

He didn’t believe that there could be anyone who wouldn’t be shocked at his talent.

Of course, there were a lot of other abilities that he still hadn’t shown.

Staring straight at Roan, he continued his words.

“First, we must meet with Prince Simon and receive the permit to move the troops and use force within the capital.”

Because Miller Castle was the kingdom’s capital and where the palace was located, they couldn’t move troops and use force without permission.

“Prince Simon and his faction is holding a meeting in the eastern wing of the palace. We should head over there.”

With this much, even Roan should be shocked.

Clay believed so.

But instead, Roan only faintly smiled and shook his head.

“There’s really no need to do that.”

A soft voice.

Behind him, the Amaranth troop lined up.

With a look asking just what he meant, Clay stared at Roan.

Looking straight into Clay’s eyes, Roan continued to talk.

“We have already received the permission to move our troops and use force within Miller Castle.”

Boom.

Suddenly, Clay felt as if a stone hit the back of his head.

“Eh?”

A questioning sound as if it was hard to believe.

His face contorted.

Roan cheerfully smiled.

“Last night, I visited Sir Duke Bradley Webster and received the permit beforehand.”

At those words, Clay shook his head with a big frown on his face.

“How, how did you think of getting permission ahead of time?”

Roan answered as he looked straight into Clay’s eyes.

“Who knows. Should I say that I expected such a situation? Of course, Mister Clay appearing here was something completely unexpected.”

Of course, it wasn’t a heedless prediction.

The permit for battle inside the capital wasn’t something that could be earned with such pitiful evidence and reasons.

Originally, Roan planned to rescue Anthony Holten from the trap and interrogate him based upon the information that Keep and the information squad had gathered.

Because he planned to catch or hunt down the mastermind once he was revealed, he had received the permit to move his troops and use force within the capital beforehand.

‘Always plan while considering various situations.’

And while carrying out that plan, Clay had appeared and reported that the Janis information agency, one of the groups that Roan had predicted to be the mastermind, as the source of the event.

Thanks to that, he could skip the needless rescue work and interrogation.

Paat!

At that moment, Austin tied a blue flag bearing the symbol of Rinse Royalty and the house of Duke Webster below the Amaranth troop flag.

That was a type of badge that allowed the use of force within Miller Castle.

Smiling softly, Roan looked at Clay.

Clay looked somewhat stunned.

With a stutter, he asked once again.

“Di, did Sir Duke Webster really give the permit so easily?”

Roan simply smiled instead of answering.

Roan and Bradley.

Only the two knew what kind of condition and trade passed between them.

‘Did, did I misread Sir Baron Tale?”

Clay swallowed nervously.

He felt as if he had looked down on Roan and his subordinates more than he thought.

Seeing Clay like this, Roan inwardly let out a short sigh.

‘I hope he learned something from this event.’

He hoped that even if Clay’s pride was hurt, it would be an opportunity for him to be humble.

Roan pulled on the reins.

Hihihihing!

The horse cried out aloud.

“We shall head towards the capital!”

“Yes sir!””

The entire Amaranth troop saluted.

Slightly nodding his head at Clay, Roan quickly kicked his horse.

Dududududu!

Soon, the Amaranth troop, with Roan at the head, ran towards the capital, Miller.

‘Eh, eh?’

Clay, who was half stunned, also kicked his horse soon afterwards and leaned down on the horse.

A well-practiced horse riding skill.

Staring at Roan’s back, who was going ahead, he gritted his teeth.

‘I have to prove my worth one more time.’

He didn’t wish to remain as a mediocre person.

Like so, he was a man who was full of pride and loved all of himself.

Dududududu!

The sound that shook the ground slowly went away.

Once Roan and the Amaranth troop went away, a weird silence fell throughout the hunting ground.

“Did, did they really leave?”

“Whi, while leaving us just like this?”

The nobles, who couldn’t do anything and were standing still on the hunting ground, panicked.

“They babbled about something by themselves and suddenly went toward Miller Castle.”

“Is it possible that our plan had been revealed?”

“Nah, no way. Even we don’t know where the Janis information agency’s headquarters is.”

They forced smiles on their faces and looked at each other.

But their eyes were full of fear and unease.

One of them muttered in a spiritless voice.

“What should we do now?”

At those words, the strange silence pervaded once again.

But the silence this time didn’t last so long.

“Get me out of here! Just get me out of here!”

Anthony’s shout echoed through the hunting grounds.

And following that.

“Save me!”

“Please help us!”

The knights and the soldiers who fell into traps shouted from here and there.

Only after that did the nobles take hold of their dazed minds.

“For now, let’s rescue Viscount Holten.”

“That should be good.”

Stabbing the ground with a long spear or a sword step by step, they headed toward the trap Anthony fell in.

Soon, a shoddy and lousy rescue operation began.

On the other hand, the Amaranth troop that headed toward Miller Castle was soon in front of the castle’s east gate.

“Un?”

Roan, who was riding ahead of the others, frowned as he pulled his reins.

The speed of the war horse that had been sprinting gradually slowed down.

“What is it, sir?”

When Austin came up to ask, Roan pointed at Miller Castle.

There, tens of horses were rapidly running toward them.

‘Who are they?’

Everyone tilted their head.

When the distance between the two closed, the troop flag raised up high in the lead position was seen clearly.

Bloodstorm.

‘If it’s Bloodstorm, then that’s the troop led by Sir Viscount Ruin.’

Viscount Tio Ruin, who should be aiding Simon in the palace, led several soldiers and appeared.

‘Is it perhaps because of Viscount Holten and his lackeys?’

It was already well known that Viscount Anthony Holten and many nobles followed Tommy Rinse, the second prince.

Because he knew that, Roan had made meticulous preparations of his own and before he joined the hunting competition.

‘Did Prince Simon send Sir Viscount Ruin because he was worried about me?’

If it wasn’t that, there was no reason for Tio to appear here.

But Roan soon shook his head.

The appearance of Tio, who was riding in the front, wasn’t that of a general prepared for a fight.

A light attire and a bright face.

And the number of soldiers was merely ten high level knights.

Kicking his horse, Tio rode toward Roan.

“Baron Tale.”

With a fancy horse riding skill, Tio halted his horse.

Still sitting on top of the horse, Roan bowed.

“Sir Viscount Tio Ruin.”

“Aren’t you supposed to be at the hunting grounds?”

Tio tilted his head.

“That is……”

Roan didn’t hide the situation.

A short explanation ensued.

Tio soon made a bitter smile as he shook his head.

‘What idiots.’

In the first place, there was no way that they, who only knew how to sit in front of desks and flap their mouths, could face Roan.

Roan raised his head slightly and looked at Tio.

“But where is Sir Viscount Ruin going in such a hurry?”

“Ah! I was on my way to find you. There are some things I have for you.”

Smiling brightly, Tio gestured at his aides behind him.

Two of his aides approached while each holding a bow.

“These are the bows Prince Simon is presenting you. One is for Baron Tale, and the other is for the Hundred-man Commander Harrison.”

“Ah……”

Quiet exclamations leaked out from Roan and Harrison’s mouths.

They carefully received the bows the aides passed to them.

‘To think he would present not only me, but also Harrison with a bow.’

It was a completely unexpected event.

Harrison was especially moved.

‘The prince has remembered even a common soldier like me.’

He couldn’t have even imagined that he would one day receive a present from a prince.

Roan and Harrison deeply lowered their heads.

Tio smiled as he watched that sight.

“I would like to ask you to take a shot right now, but it seems that it isn’t the time for such leisure.”

Every second was precious.

It was possible that the Janis information agency would cut their tail and successfully run away if things go wrong.

Tio moved to the side and turned the horse toward the capital.

“We shall join in as well.”

“Are you sure, sir?”

Tio nodded at Roan’s question.

“Of course. We can’t just sit still when they aimed for your life.”

They were truly reliable words.

Roan slightly lowered his head and then grabbed his reins.

Once again, they were ready to charge straight on.

At that moment, Tio’s eyes, which were surveying the Amaranth troop, noticeably creased.

“You are……”

The one he directed his words at was Clay.

Smiling faintly, Clay lowered his head.

“It has been a while. Sir Viscount Ruin.”

Surprisingly, Clay and Tio were acquainted.

“Do you two know each other?”

Roan looked at Tio and asked.

With a strained complexion, Tio nodded his head.

“I once took him in as a subordinate.”

“I once served him in the past.”

Clay added on those words.

Tio shook his head as he looked at Clay and his composed face.

“I trusted him with a few jobs since he seemed quite capable, but because he was arrogant and insincere, I chased him out.”

A very direct critique.

But Clay was composed.

“I went out on my own.”

He didn’t shrink back even in front of a noble.

Tio creased his forehead.

‘That unpleasant attitude is still the same.’

The sight of him trusting his abilities too much and butting in over confidently had ruined the evaluation of Clay.

Tio turned his head and looked towards Roan.

“For now, let’s leave this story for later since now is time to pull out the roots.”

“Yes, I understand.”

Roan forcefully threw away his curiosity and once again kicked his horse.

Dududududu!

With Roan at the head, the troops once again began to move.

The Amaranth troop and the Bloodstorm troop swiftly passed through the east gate and ran down the linear street.

“Ahh!”

“Woah!”

The people, who had been leisurely moving about, dodged left and right as they screamed.

Thankfully, no one was injured.

After they had ran for a while.

The Amaranth troop charged into the commerce district located at the very western edge within the castle.

“That wooden warehouse at the end is the Janis information agency!”

Clay loudly shouted.

Roan gritted his teeth and nodded.

‘It’s the same place that Keep investigated.’

The two people’s judgments aligned.

From a glance, it was merely an ordinary warehouse.

However, this was the headquarters of the Janis information agency that was the mastermind of the event this time.

The warehouse’s doors were secured with a solid lock.

Roan waved his hand and called out to Harrison.

“Harrison! Use the present the prince has given you and show off your skills.”

“Yes! Understood.”

Wrapping his two legs tightly around his horse, Harrison spun the bow once and flicked the empty string several times.

“Hmmph.”

A sound of controlling one’s breath.

Piing! Ping! Ping!

Three arrows flew out consecutively.

Roan, Tio, and the Amaranth troops soldiers turned their heads and chased the arrow.

Puuk! Puk!

The arrows precisely hit the lock that secured the great doors.

Psuk!

The lock couldn’t handle the impact and broke apart.

“Waah!”

Some of the soldiers exclaimed.

On the other hand, Harrison flicked the empty string a few more times with a composed face and glanced at Tio.

“It’s an excellent bow.”

Tio shook his head at those words.

“Your skills are even more excellent.”

He was truly impressed.

Even if the bow was good, it was something that wasn’t even familiar in his hand.

But with only swinging the bow once and flicking the empty bowstring several times, Harrison handled the bow as if he had used it for a long time.

‘If he were to learn how to use mana……’

He may become one of the best archers in the history of Rinse Kingdom, no, in the entire continent.

‘How envious.’

Tio was tempted by Harrison’s talent.

But he couldn’t possibly show his personal greed.

‘Since he is Baron Tale’s subordinate and his loyalty is also quite excellent.’

He tried to forget it, but the regret couldn’t be helped.

At that moment, Roan held the Travias Spear up high and charged towards the wooden warehouse.

“We’re piercing straight through!”

And following him, the Amaranth troop shouted aloud.

“Charge!”

A truly fierce and unstoppable charge.

Finally, the head of the charge touched the warehouse’s doors.

Bang!

With a crash, the once solid door broke and flew off.

Within the capital, Miller Castle, an unexpected battle began.

No, the long expected battle began.

Chapter 121




“Even so, isn’t this too dangerous?”

“Wouldn’t it have been better to send a letter and negotiate our stance instead?”

“They look like a group that we could negotiate with.”

Complaints, the only thing that came out of their mouths were complaints

Looking at the executives of the Janis information agency, Hooke exhaled a short sigh.

‘Cowardly bastards.’

They were satisfied with the current size of the Janis information agency.

However, Hooke was different.

‘It must not only control Miller Castle’s information, but also the entire Rinse Kingdom, no, the entirety of the continent beyond this kingdom.

Expanding the Janis information agency to be the greatest information group in the continent was his goal and his dream.

Truly a grand ambition.

‘And they’re telling me to back off simply because they’re scared of a countryside baron, moreover a guy who just became a noble?’

He shook his head.

If the agency becomes too protective of itself and backs off, it won’t be able to progress onto wider roads and higher places.

Now that he saw them like this, Baba once again looked much better.

‘Even though he was soft and weak, he never questioned any of my orders.’

On the other hand, the other executives of the Janis information agency wanted to hold hands with Roan and reconcile with him, saying that it wasn’t too late.

‘Cowardly bas……’

When he was about to curse again from his rage.

Boom!

Suddenly, the meeting room’s door abruptly opened.

A distressed looking young man pushed his face into the room and shouted aloud.

“We failed! We failed!”

They were abrupt words, but Hooke as well as everyone in the room was well aware of the meaning behind the man’s words.

Viscount Anthony Holten’s hunting competition scheme had failed.

“Damn it. I knew this would happen!”

“In the end, we made an enemy out of a kingdom’s noble!”

“Cht! If only we moved more carefully.”

Once again, complaints, and only complains came pouring out of their mouths.

Boom!

Hooke couldn’t hold back and slammed his fist down on the table.

“Khmm.”

Flinching, the executives backed down.

While they echoed each other’s words and heated up the room, they had completely forgotten about Hooke’s existence.

With a cold look in his eyes, Hooke glared at the executives.

“Let’s stop here.”

“Ye, yes. Understood.”

The executives quickly nodded their heads.

Hooke stood up and cleaned up the papers on top of the table.

‘As expected, Viscount Holten wasn’t good enough.’

He let out a short sigh.

‘If Baron Tale interrogates Viscount Holten……’

As the ones who schemed together from the backlines, their identity would be revealed.

‘Just to be safe, we should move our base.’

Of course, there was something that needed to be done before that.

“Baba.”

“Yes. Master.”

Baba quickly stood up from his chair and lowered his head.

“Destroy all the documents related to Viscount Holten.”

“Yes. Understood.”

In the first place, all the documents were already organized.

Although Anthony’s scheme had failed, there was no reason to hurry.

‘Viscount Holten doesn’t know the location of our headquarters.’

If Roan tries to locate the base, it would take a significant amount of time.

In that time, they simply needed to organize all the documents and goods and move the headquarters in a casual manner.

But that leisure didn’t last as long as he believed it would.

Boom!

Once again, the meeting room’s door violently opened.

Hooke, who was already forcefully holding back his aggravated mood, couldn’t restrain himself and yelled.

“What is it this time?!”

A cold voice.

The young man who pushed his head into the meeting room urgently shouted.

“It, it’s the enemy! The Amaranth troop is attacking our headquarters.”

Immediately, Hooker and the executives’ eyes enlarged.

“What?!”

“What did you just say?!”

Looks of disbelief.

The young man once again shouted his report out loud.

“The Amaranth troop is attacking our headquarters! Baron Roan Tale has invaded!”

Hooke frowned.

‘Impossible!’

It was impossible.

It had been slightly over an year since they had set up their headquarters in the wooden warehouse.

And during that time, they had worked extra hard to conceal its location.

Thanks to that, there was not a single information agency located in the same Miller Castle that knew of the Janis information agency’s headquarters.

‘But just how did Baron Tale find out?’

Hooke’s head was spinning.

Several possibilities immediately passed through his head.

‘Perhaps?’

Hooke’s gaze turned towards Baba.

‘Did he learn the identities of the spies we attached to him?’

If it wasn’t that they didn’t know but merely pretended and attached their own spies in turn, not only the identity of the spies, even the location of the headquarters would have been revealed.

‘Damn it.’

Hooke finally spat out a curse.

“Everyone take only the most special and highest level documents and escape.

“Yes! Understood!”

The executives answered as one and rapidly moved.

Hooke also did the same.

Quickly exiting the meeting room, he gritted his teeth.

‘Roan Tale……’

Feelings of regret surged up, but it was too late at this point.

‘Did I underestimate him too much?’

It felt as if he had pulled a sleeping lion’s whiskers.

But the deed was already done.

‘For now, I have to safely escape from the base.’

Hooke’s footsteps moved towards a different direction than that of the other executives.

A strange light shined in his eyes.

‘It doesn’t matter even if the headquarters falls down and all the agents die.’

He gritted his teeth.

‘I. If only I can survive, it’s possible to rebuild the Janis information agency whenever I want.’

It was a cold and heartless thought.

Hooke inhaled deeply.

He quickly navigated through a complicated maze and stopped in front of a solid wall.

Glancing around his vicinity and after seeing that the coast was clear, he tapped on the wall with a peculiar hand movement.

Kugung.

Slightly, the wall moved inwards.

Hooke quickly stepped into the inner space.

Kugung.

The wall returned to its original position once again.

And just like that, Hooke disappeared.

*****

“Don’t let a single one escape!”

“Maintain the formation!”

A tall troop flag.

Below, the members of the Amaranth troop moved systematically.

After piercing through the warehouse’s door, the Amaranth troop positioned themselves in a giant circle with a ten-man group as the base.

A sight as if they were surrounding the wooden warehouse and slowly closing in on it.

“Stop them!”

“Buy as much time as possible.”

With the warehouse behind them, agents of the Janis information agency desperately resisted.

At first, they pretended to be innocent warehouse workers, but when the Amaranth troop attempted to forcefully enter the warehouse without being fooled, they revealed their true colors.

“They are the ones who attempted to harm our lord! Do not hesitate your hands!”

Austin ordered the men as he dashed around on his horse.

“Yes sir!”

Hundreds of Amaranth troop members answered together at the same time and boosted their morale.

Looking at that sight, Viscount Tio Ruin and his knights quietly exclaimed.

‘I think it whenever I see it, but the Amaranth troop truly is a strange group.’

Each individual’s strength were definitely far below that of a knight, but together, they displayed an incredible might and spirit.

Ping! Piing! Ping!

With sharp sounds, tens of arrows cut through the air.

The archers, with Harrison at the lead, had begun to attack with their arrows.

Pbuk! Pbuk! Pbububuk!

“Kuaak!

“Kuk!”

The agents who were resisting had been riddled with arrows and started falling down one by one.

Instantly, their defensive line was torn apart.

And towards that gap, Roan and the cavalry charged in.

Ssskuk! Sssukuk!

“Kkrrg”.

Every time the tip of the spear danced, multiple agents lost their necks and fell down.

Although the agents of the Janis information agency were agile and had quick hands, their overall might wasn’t very great.

They were no match for Roan, no the Amaranth troop.

“Forwards!”

When Roan pointed at the warehouse’s entrance, two horsemen ran up and slammed on the door with hooves.

Boom!

The tightly closed door splintered into pieces and flew open. 1

Now, the door was wide open.

The inside of the large warehouse appeared before their eyes.

Dududududu!

The sound of horse hooves shaking the ground echoed.

The cavalry entered the warehouse.

“S, stop!”

“Stop them!”

Agents of the Janis information agency, who were spread out all over the place, tried to slow them down but weren’t enough to stop the Amaranth troop.

Sskuk! Sssukuk! Boom! Kugung!

Swords and spears cut through the air and the war horses violently ran amok.

And in each and every time, the agents fell with cries of death.

“Find the entrance!”

At Roan’s shout, the cavalry, which had infiltrated the warehouse like a long string, jumped off their saddles and into the air.

Running through the lumber blocks stacked high and the white wood shavings that carpeted the floor, each one of them began to search for the secret entrance into the headquarters.

The hands and feet moved around tirelessly.

At that moment.

“We found it!”

They found the door skillfully hidden between two highly stacked lumbers blocks.

‘Mister Clay’s words were true.’

The reason the Amaranth troop could quickly find the secret door was thanks to Clay’s advice.

Because he had told them the approximate location, they could find the entrance without much trouble even within the similar looking layouts.

“Infiltrate and capture the agents!”

“Sir yes sir!”

As soon as he gave the order, the troop members each raised their weapons and entered into the passage.

“Keep!”

Roan then called Keep, who was in charge of the information squad.

“Yes!”

Keep quickly ran up and gave a short salute.

“You will lead the information squad and secure the documents and papers that the Janis information agency has stored.”

“Yes! Understood.”

Keep immediately answered and gestured toward the back with his hand.

Soon, tens of agile and quick-footed soldiers entered the door with Keep.

Following that, Roan ordered the rest of the troops to capture the enemies that were left and to restrict access in and out of the warehouse and the surrounding area.

‘Then, should I move as well?’

Roan, who had given out all the necessary orders, kicked off the ground and entered the secret passage behind everyone else.

The lanterns lining the walls were pushing away the pitch-black darkness.

The view wasn’t very bright, but Roan was able to clearly see even a point far away thanks to Kalian’s Tears.

Cutting down the agents running towards him, Roan stepped deep into the base.

‘Incredible.’

Roan inwardly exclaimed.

The size of the Janis information agency’s underground headquarters was truly colossal.

Furthermore, the twisting and turning maze-like space posed a likely danger of getting lost and being trapped within the maze.

At that moment.

‘Un?’

He saw a man hurriedly running at the end of the maze.

‘A simple looking face that doesn’t fit his large build.’

Roan was mentally going through Keep’s reports.

‘He’s Baba, the executive of the Janis information agency.’

He was different than the small fries that Roan had cut down until now.

‘I have to catch him.’

Roan kicked off the ground right away and threw his body forward.

A wisp of mana flew out of the mana hole and into his feet.

Paat!

Suddenly, Roan’s movement sped up like a flying tiger.

Even when he came to the end of the maze, he didn’t reduce his speed.

Tat!

Instead, he kicked off the floor and placed his two feet on the opposite wall, letting him turn his body.

It was a smooth and rapid movement.

The movement was chaotic enough to make it look like the world was spinning, but Roan was able to focus on Baba and chase him thanks to Kalian’s Tears.

“Get out of my way!”

Puuk! Sskuk!

The spear and his fist danced towards the agents that blocked his way.

“Kuk!’

“Kuuk!”

And each and every time, the agents couldn’t even offer proper resistance and were blown away to the sides.

“Uuhuk!”

Baba, who was running ahead, screamed when he saw Roan chasing him.

His face turned utterly white as his eyes opened wide.

Baba was completely horrified.

‘I, I don’t want to die!’

To Roan, who was now directly behind him, Baba waved his hand.

Paat!

Suddenly, the stacks of paper in his hand scattered all over the place.

Roan frowned as he looked at the bundles of paper that densely covered up what was in front of him.

Ssssssk!

Once he focused his eyes, Kalian’s Tears activated.

Immediately, the bundles of paper that were flying all over the place began to move slowly.

He could even read each and every word within the chaotically scattering papers.

At that moment.

‘Hm? This is?’

Reading the contents of the paper that blocked his sight, Roan made unique kind of smile.

‘It’s a document recording the secret deal with Viscount Holten.’

To save his one and only life, Baba had thrown away the most important documents in the Janis information agency and ran.

Roan stopped his feet and extended his hands toward the papers.

The hands looked frustratingly slow due to Kalian’s Tears.

But their movements were much faster than that of the papers that flew all around him.

If others had seen that sight, their jaws would had fallen off from their stupefied faces.

To anyone else that was watching him, it would have looked as if Roan was rapidly catching the scattering papers one by one while standing in the passageway

“Huu.”

After he caught all of the papers, Roan exhaled deeply.

When he blinked once, the movements around him returned to normal.

Although Baba had escaped while he organized the papers, he didn’t chase after him.

‘However much those fools run, they’ll still be within my grasp.’

The tip of his mouth slightly went up.

At that moment, he heard Austin’s voice from behind him.

“Sir! We have killed and or captured most of the average agents. But we cannot find the executive level agents. It seems that they have escaped through a secret passageway.’

Although the content of the report was urgent, his voice and appearance were in fact relaxed.

Austin slowly walked up to Roan’s side.

“About that man named Clay.”

His voice was slightly mixed with wonder.

Looking around at the maze’s complicated and twisted paths, he continued to speak.

“Just how do you think he knew that there were secret exits? And not only one or two, but four of them.”

At those words, Roan pocketed the papers he was holding and shrugged.

“Who knows. We cannot be sure of it yet. But one thing is for sure…….”

Roan looked at Austin and made a faint smile.

“It’s that mister Clay isn’t an ordinary person.”

Austin nodded his head.

Somehow, his expression turned dark.

“Is he someone who can help us?”

Roan nodded immediately when Austin asked.

“Of course. But……”

His words drifted off.

With a quiet voice, Roan whispered.

“We’ll have to wait and see if he’s a good person.”

******

“Damn it. Master’s ambition is just too grand.”

“You said it. Even though there’s no problem with eating and living even with the current size of the organization.”

“I knew something like this would happen.”

In the pitch-black passage without a single light, complaints pouring out of their mouths.

The owners of the voices were the executives of the Janis information agency, who had used the common agents as shields and were attempting to escape through one of the secret exits.

“What about the other guys?”

“They probably chose a different escape route.”

“And master?”

“Let’s not worry about master. He probably escaped even earlier than we did.”

Talking in a quiet voice, they rapidly moved their feet.

At that moment, the one who was walking in the lead stopped and groped around with his hands.

“We’re here. Everyone be quiet.”

As soon as he finished his words, the complaint-filled passage fell into silence.

Druk. Druk.

The sound of a lock turning echoed.

Kkiiiig.

When he put strength into his shoulder and pushed, the tightly closed exit slowly opened up.

Immediately, an incredible stench pierced their noses.

“Damn it. Even if being secretive was important, just why did they have to build the exit in the feces dump?”

“Don’t complain about it. It’s because that it’s built here that no one would ever come here to find us.”

“Right. Just what insane bastard would even think that this place would be connected to the secret exit?”

Giggling amongst themselves, the executives exited through the doorway one by one.

Around the door, a ridiculously amount of feces was piled around.

“Uck. The smell.”

“For now let’s get out of here.”

Plugging up their nose, the executives quickly moved their feet.

No, they were about to move their feet.

“Uh?!”

But with eyes like that of a surprised rabbit, they were soon petrified like stones.

Common soldiers stood in a long line along the feces dump.

A familiar insignia was carved on their breastplates.

“Ju, just how did the Amaranth troop……”

The soldiers of the Amaranth troop that had attacked the information agency’s base also appeared at the end of the secret passageway.

At that moment, the soldiers move to the sides and the only young man who wore a different outfit appeared.

He was an imposing man with very small and thin eyes.

“Executives of the Janis information agency. You’ve had quite the trouble in this feces pile.”

A confident and bold attitude.

“My name is Clay. One soon to be serving Sir Baron Tale, I am……”

A weird smile formed on his mouth.

“A Druid.”

Druid.

A class of sorcerers who summons plants and animals or draws in and uses their strength.

A highly skilled druid could even shapeshift into animals and plants.

But the majority of druids could merely draw in a portion of an animals’ or plants’ strengths or communicate with existing animals and plants.

And even then, it was hard to find a druid at that level.

No, to be exact, it was hard to even meet a druid.

This situation was due to the war between humans and elves five hundred years ago.

At the time, the humans were expanding their power through magical and technological advances.

On the other hand, the elves settled in the Grain Mountains that bisected the continent and lived harmoniously with nature.

The humans who expanded their power and built towns and castles.

The elves who cherished each and every single tree and blade of grass and were content with their lives.

It was inevitable that these two diametrically different races would come into conflict with each other.

The humans invaded the elves of the Grain Mountain Range to control the entire continent and the elves fought back against the humans who laid waste to the forests, mountains, and rivers.

At that time, the druids amongst the humans – who loved the plants, the forest, and the earth – sided with the elves.

The humans were incensed by the druids’ betrayal.

Once the war ends, all traitors shall be condemned!

Their rage did not easily subside.

And so, the humans and elves’ war lasted over ten years.

And in the end, the war ended with the humans’ triumph.

No, to be exact, the elves, who saw the land and the forests become ill at the prolonged war, gave up their land and went into the vast forest in the continent’s south, thus putting a lackluster end to the war.

The humans celebrated, and from that point on, the continent’s history became the human’s’ history.

And true to their words during the war, the humans branded the druids as traitors and executed or threw them into jails.

And the druids who barely managed to escape or hide lived their lives while hiding their identities.

Despising the humans who executed or imprisoned druids as they pleased, and loathing the elves who threw them away like old shoes.

Like that, four hundred years passed by and the druids no longer showed themselves.

They became mere existences only mentioned in history.

But then, the thin-eyed young man, Clay, suddenly introduced himself as a druid.

“Druid?”

“Did he say a druid?”

The faces of the Janis information agency’s executives as well as the members of the Amaranth troop were colored in surprise.

Cheerily smiling, Clay looked at the Janis information agency’s executives.

‘Me revealing my identity means……’

His heart trembled.

‘I shall go out into the world.’

His grandfather, who returned to the earth when Clay was young, and his father lived their lives by concealing their identities.

Although the people’s enmity towards the druids had long faded, they said that the historical truth of their betrayal and the stigma of traitor weren’t easily erased.

‘Cowards.’

Clay didn’t want that kind of life.

The druids had merely made their choice based on their beliefs.

But instead of having their choice be respected, they were thrown away by both the humans and the elves and were persecuted.

‘If I can become a hero known throughout this world……’

At that time, the people’s view of the druids will thoroughly change.

‘When that happens, the druids who still live in hiding will come to me.’

That too would become another part of his strength, his base, and his power.

But for that, he himself must climb up on his own to a higher place.

This was the reason Clay was looking for someone to serve.

This was the reason he was looking for someone who would notice his talent and use him preciously.

Everything was for his rise to power and to heal the painful scar of druids in history.

‘I must become someone whom anyone can look up to.’

If it looked like he would rise to a vague position or merely be a mediocre person, he wouldn’t have even planned to start.

‘If it’s Sir Baron Tale, at least……’

He may be a big step or a coadjutor to Clay’s success.

‘Or he may truly be a person whom I’ll dedicate my life to follow.’

That was Clay’s evaluation.

With a cough, he pointed at the Janis information agency’s executives.

“Now, then. Let us quickly finish our work.”

As soon as Clay said those words, the soldiers of Amaranth troop, who were standing there with dazed expressions, quickly moved.

When they pressured the Janis information agency’s executives with their swords and spears raised, the executives quickly raised up their hands and kneeled.

They were simply no match for the members of the Amaranth troop in terms of strength.

Looking at the executives lying flat on the floor, Clay faintly smiled. 1

‘With this, my first success has been made.’

Victory after victory.

‘I will always win.’

He vowed to succeed one after another and spread his name.

Clay’s long and thin eyes fiercely trembled.

Once he had decided, his ambition soared.

For now, it was unknown whether that was accompanied with loyalty towards Roan.

But at the very least, Roan was right now an absolutely necessary existence to Clay.

*****

“What?”

Clay became baffled.

The confident and bold attitude he always had on crumbled.

When Roan attacked the Janis information agency’s headquarters, Clay had borrowed a separate unit of Amaranth troop and completely blocked off the four secret passages.

Thanks to him, they managed to capture every single one of the Janis information agency’s executives alive.

Amongst them, Baba was also included.

However.

‘Hooke isn’t there?’

For some reason, the Janis information agency’s master, Hooke, who they absolutely had to capture, couldn’t be found.

The Amaranth troop had thoroughly looked and scoured the entire underground maze, but he wasn’t seen anywhere.

‘So there’s another secret path that only Hooke knows about.’

Clay frowned.

At that moment, he heard Austin’s voice.

“For now, we sent a scout unit to the castle’s four main gates.’

Since this was the capital, they couldn’t close the gates as they wished.

Instead, they planned to send a scout unit to thoroughly check the identities of those who are passing through the gate.

But even so, they couldn’t only rely on the scout unit.

“We will search for the secret passage for now.”

Everyone nodded at Roan’s words.

They couldn’t sit still and simply let the time pass by.

At that instant, Clay, who was sitting down with a confused look on his face, suddenly stood up.

“I will try to find it.”

“You will, Mr. Clay?”

“Yes.”

Clay immediately nodded.

‘Hm.’

With calm eyes, Roan stared into Clay’s eyes.

The confused look was now long gone.

‘Druid, he said……’

As expected, Roan had received the report that Clay was a druid.

‘I never met a druid even once in the last life.’

Even for Roan who was living a second life, druids were an unfamiliar existence.

‘At the very least, I did see elves several times in the past.’

The elves, who had hidden deep in the vast forest in the continent’s south, began to slowly show themselves about ten years from now.

Of course, it wasn’t out of their own free will.

As the entire continent was swept away by the flames of war, the elves had revealed themselves to protect the forest and their lives as a consequence.

‘The Great Warring Era became even more fierce after the elves had appeared.’

The fight between the humans had spread to a fight between races.

“Then, please.”

Roan organized his thoughts and nodded toward Clay.

Clay then took three steps back and took out a small stick from his chest pocket.

Made out of oak, it was a type of a wand used by the druids.

Originally, it should have been much bigger and longer, but during the druid’s time in hiding, it was shortened to a foot.

Clay held the wooden wand in his right hand and used his left hand to cover-up his right hand.

At the same time, he lightly closed his eyes and murmured unintelligible words.

That sound was almost like an animal’s cry.

A moment later.

Squeak! Squeak squeak! Squeak!

Through the small gaps in the doors and the holes at the corners of the maze, jet-black rats began to show up.

Squeaking quietly, they circled round and round around Clay.

Flash!

Clay suddenly opened his eyes.

No, even though he did open his eyes, even that was hard to tell whether they were open or not.

But in the slightly slitted places, the irides shining in green could definitely be seen.

‘Are those the eyes of a druid?’

Roan didn’t miss that sight.

Meanwhile, Clay extended his left hand towards the rats.

Then, one of the rats climbed up onto Clay’s hand.

Squeak! Squeak squeak! Squeak!

Staring into each other’s eyes, Clay and the rat whispered as if they were conversing with each other.

And when Clay put the rat down on the ground a moment later, it shook its head and tail at its friends and soon ran quickly through the maze.

Squeak! Squeak squeak!

That was same for the other rats.

Tens and hundreds of rats filled the maze and began to run.

Clay took one glance at that scene and turned to Roan.

“If you would please wait just a moment, I will have found the secret passage by then.”

“That’s quite an amazing ability.”

Roan nodded with an amazed look on his face.

Clay faintly smiled and answered.

“This is one of the basic abilities of a druid.”

At those words, Roan asked in a quiet voice.

“Is the reason you knew about the Janis information agency’s inner circumstances also thanks to the ability of the druids?”

“A part of it, yes, but that’s not all.”

Clay shook his head.

Systemically shaking the oaken stick back and forth, he continued to speak.

“Although it is correct that I found out about the Janis information agency’s agents and their conversations using animals and plants, I found out about the inner structure of the headquarters and secret passages through another method.”

“By another method, what……”

When Roan was about to continue his question, Clay’s wooden stick that he was shaking suddenly stopped.

Clay looked at Roan and cheerfully smiled.

“It seems we have found the secret passage.”

Then, he turned his body and began to walk.

Roan, Austin, and Harrison, as well as the Amaranth troop, quickly followed behind him.

Following the sound of the rats within his head, Clay busily moved his feet.

Once they followed deeper into the maze, a dead-end soon showed itself.

Squeak! Squeak squeak! Squeak!

At a solid wall that extended on one side of the space.

The rats were gathered in front of it and were noisily squeaking.

Without any words, Clay turned to Roan.

His mission was to simply find the secret passage.

The rest was Roan’s job.

‘The ability of the druids is truly amazing.”

Roan inwardly exclaimed as he walked up to the wall.

If he had ordered the troops to search, they would have barely found it only after multiple days.

Sssk.

Roan extended his hand and swiped at the wall, but there wasn’t any device or a hole that could be felt.

Scrunching his nose, he took a step back.

“Everyone move back.”

At his short command, Austin and the Amaranth troop stepped far away.

Clay also tactfully stepped back.

And the rats that were lining the wall moved back as well.

“Hmph.”

Using the Flamdor Mana Technique, he pulled mana into his right hand.

And at the same time, Roan performed the most basic move of Reid’s Art of Fighting, the art of the straight punch.

The muscles expanded tautly and shook as if they would burst.

And as the wrist, elbow, and the shoulder gracefully turned, a perfect thrust was performed.

The tough fist touched the wall.

Boom!

With an explosion of sound, Roan’s fist pierced into the wall.

“Huup!”

“Woah!”

Clay and the Amaranth troop widely opened their eyes.

The sight of destroying a solid wall with a bare fist was simply unparalleled.

Putting strength into his right arm, Roan cautiously pulled his fist out of the wall.

Then.

Kugugugung.

The wall, which was barely standing, fell down.

At the same time, a pitch black passage revealed itself.

It was a small and narrow path enough for one person to barely move through.

Roan glanced at the path and walked straight in without any hesitation.

“Ah! Lord! Let us lead the way!”

Austin quickly followed behind a moment later, but Roan had already stepped deep into the passage.

Thanks to Kalian’s Tears, Roan was able to walk through the inky passage without a pause.

Once he had walked through the twisted and continuous path for a long time, a dead end soon appeared.

Although it appeared to be a completely blocked dead end, Roan could see an extraordinarily thin crack above his head.

Carefully, Roan pushed up the space above his head with his two hands.

Giiik.

With a sound of wood rubbing against another piece of wood, an exit big enough for one person to pass through appeared.

Roan lightly flexed his feet and jumped out of the passage.

Paat!

Pulling up mana just in case of an unexpected event, Roan quickly searched around himself.

Various household items and piles of trash were randomly spread around.

‘An abandoned hut……’

A great number of spiderwebs were spread between the walls and the ceiling.

Furthermore, the right wall and the wall behind him was halfway crumbled down, letting him see the entire street outside through the hole.

“Uuugh. Small. So small.”

“Why is it so dark?”

The members of the Amaranth troop that followed Roan through the secret passage complained on and on.

Without minding it one bit, Roan took a step forward ahead of them.

‘I don’t see any sight of Hooke.’

Most likely, he had already ran away to someplace else.

Giiik!

Opening a door that didn’t quite look like a door, a familiar smell hit his nose.

It was a stench that, although had weakened quite a bit, still remained pungent.

‘Is this perhaps……?’

Passing through the maze-like alleyways that continued in front of the house, Roan headed towards a large alley outside.

“Of course……”

A familiar scene spread out before his eyes.

“This is Aran Alley.”

The place that Hooke’s secret passage was connected to.

That was Aran Alley, the Miller Castle’s slum where Roan and the Amaranth troop had stayed for a while.

“Lord.”

“This looks like Aran Alley.”

Austin and Harrison, who followed him out a moment later, shook their heads with looks of dismay.

They sighed as they stared at the sea of people that completely filled the alley.

“It won’t be easy to find Hooke here.”

A place where countless number of the poor residents and the crowded buildings were chaotically spread around.

There was no place better than the Aran Alley for a runaway to hide in.

‘So he built a path towards the slum that’s easy to hide in since it’s hard to make the path all the way outside the castle.’

Roan deeply inhaled and bit his lips.

Then, Clay showed up much later.

Looking at Aran Alley that was full of people, he let out a sigh.

“If Hooke had run away to Aran Alley, it’ll take quite a long time to find him even if we use the druids’ skills.”

It might have been possible if they were to search a enclosed space, but the size of Aran Alley was simply too big.

Roan slightly creased his forehead.

‘If he led his escape path here, that must mean he had also prepared a method to escape to someplace else.’

They may lose Hooke for good.

‘We have to search even if we have to use all the troops.’

When he thought up to that point and was about to order them.

“Hm?”

Roan’s expression turned odd.

His gaze went towards the poor that walked back and forth in front of his eyes.

When Roan and the Amaranth troop who greatly helped them showed up, they showed elated expressions but didn’t dare to casually get close to them.

And all the while, they awkwardly circled around the same place.

‘What?’

He felt a strange sense of dysphoria.

At that moment, a quiet exclaim leaked out of Roan’s mouth.

‘Ah……’

Simultaneously, a bright light flashed in his two eyes.

That light was like that of an adventurer who found a treasure.

Roan faintly smiled and moved his feet.

His steps were that of someone who knew where to go.

*****

‘Why do these guys keep glancing at me so ominously?’

Pulling at the piece of a straw mat he wore over his head, Hooke creased his forehead.

Right now his appearance was undoubtedly that of a beggar.

His hair was scruffy and his skin looked filthy-black from rubbing on ash.

His clothes had holes here and there and were ripped and ragged.

It was the same appearance as that of the Aran Alley’s residents that hit his shoulder and passed by this way and that.

It was the perfect disguise.

Busily moving his feet, Hooke headed towards the safe house deep in Aran Alley.

The location of that place, no its very existence, was only known to Hooke.

A place that not even Baba and the Janis information agency’s executives knew of.

‘Damn it. It doesn’t make sense.’

Once he turned out from the narrow alleyway and arrived in front of the safe house, Hooke gritted his teeth.

‘Even if he did find out the headquarters’ location……’

When he thought about it, there were more than one or two weird points.

‘Even though I ordered Baba to spy on Baron Tale and to meticulously check the traps in the hunting grounds……’

It was hard to accept that nobody noticed the works Roan and the Amaranth troop had done in response.

‘But no report about seeing odd signs came up.’

Because of that, they had gathered the executives and were leisurely having a meeting at the time.

The light in Hooke’s eyes calmed down.

‘There’s only one reason why my eyes and ears had gone dark.’

His face completely twisted.

‘There was a traitor amongst us.’

His heart began to beat quickly.

His face turned red.

From his rage, his eyes and lips rapidly twitched.

‘No, no. This isn’t the time to be angry.’

Hooke knew how to control his anger.

He glanced around once and opened the door.

Thankfully, he couldn’t feel any presences in the house.

Hooke threw himself into the house and sat down at a corner deep inside the house.

‘For now, I have to get out of Miller Castle.’

If he could get out, he was confident that he could raise the information agency once more.

Currently, most of the highest leveled information amongst the special level information was in his chest.

‘If I sell this to the nobles and the rich……’

He could get quite a large sum of money.

With that, it should be enough to raise an information agency.

It was quite annoying to start over again from the very beginning, but it wasn’t such a hard thing to do.

‘After all, I myself am the Janis information agency.’ 2

A smile hung from his lips.

He also had the means to get out of Miller Castle.

‘I’ve been feeding bribes to the guards and the castle’s managers just in preparation for this kind of situation.’

And if things didn’t go well, he could use his connections to a wealthy acquaintance and hide amongst goods. 3

There were countless number of ways to get out of the castle.

Bdddk!

Hooke grinded his teeth.

‘Roan Tale. I will most definitely not leave you alone.’

Roan’s face passed through his eyes.

The day he grasp Rinse Kingdom’s information once again. 4

He shall start his revenge.

‘I won’t be able to directly take him on myself, but……’

He was confident that he could take down Roan if he took away other noble’s fortunes and made them fight. 5

“Roan Tale. Wait just a bit.”

His voice shook from rage.

“I will most definitely make you kne……”

When he had spoke up to that point.

Wumph!

The safe house’s door that was tightly closed opened.

“Eh?!”

Suddenly, Hooke’s eyes opened wide.

With a face that he simply couldn’t believe it, he trembled his entire body.

At the absolutely unimaginable place, at the completely unimaginable moment, a person he absolutely didn’t want to meet had appeared.

“Ba, Baron Roan Tale……?”

The person who open and appeared through the safe house’s door.

He was, without a doubt, Roan.

Roan brightly smiled and casually walked close.

“Janis information agency’s master, Hooke.”

He gazed straight into Hooke’s eyes.

“For the crime of instigating a murder of Rinse Kingdom’s noble, you are under arrest.”

A cold voice hit Hooke’s ears.

A Good Person (9) End.

for those who are confused, the executives went http://i.imgur.com/12VTop0.jpg and then the soldiers went http://i.imgur.com/7VX2HDb.jpg ↩

Basically, Hooke juste claimed that the entire agency itself was Hooke himself. ↩

For those who don’t get the image, his backup plan is to find a wealthy friend he has connections to, hide in his cart of goods (like hiding in a box, for example), and pass through the castle’s gate along with the cart of goods. ↩

For those who are confused, ‘he’ here refers to Hooke. ↩

so basically, he believes he should be able to control other nobles’ wealth once his information agency revives, and he plans on threatening the nobles into fighting Roan by holding the nobles’ wealth hostage ↩

Chapter 123




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Um… the next release will be two chapters on Sunday Night ~ Early Monday Pacific Time due to IRL situation. Sorry.

“Sir Baron Tale, that’s the guy you were looking for, right?”

“Even though we look like this, we can definitely tell if it’s Aran Alley’s people or some guy that drifted here.”

“I’m glad that we could at least pay back your kindness like this.”

“Since he’s a guy Sir Baron is chasing, he definitely must be a bad guy.”

Shouts and voices pour down from around them.

The poor of Aran Alley crowded around them.

The reason Roan could capture Hooke so incredibly quickly, and so unbelievably easily, was thanks to the help of Aran Alley’s people.

When they had heard the news that Roan and the Amaranth troop had attacked the wooden warehouse and had sent scout unit to the four big gates to search for someone, they became watchful on their own.

Until now, they had wanted to put in even their little strength to pay back the kindness they received from Roan.

And at that time, Hooke, who wasn’t usually seen in Aran Alley, had suddenly appeared and they followed him just in case.

Even Janis information agency’s master, Hooke, couldn’t even predict that the people of Aran Alley could move in such an organized fashion.

No, that was the also the same for the soldiers of the Amaranth troop and Clay.

‘This is all because our lord has opened his arms to the people of this alley.’

‘If you value people with your heart, you are repaid just like this.’

The Amaranth troop’s eyes shined towards Roan with respect.

When Roan began to clean up Aran Alley and Rott Creek and to help the poor, the soldiers at first wondered if he really needed to do so much.

It wasn’t that they didn’t think helping people in poverty was bad.

But the poor of Miller Castle had no relations with Roan.

Instead of helping the poor, it was more beneficial to buy better armors and weapons for the Amaranth troop.

And so they had thought.

But that was the thoughts of ordinary soldiers.

Roan thought differently.

‘The basis of a troop is soldiers, and the basis of a fief is people of the fief. Likewise, the basis of a nation is it’s citizens.’

To Roan, who looked towards greater heights, the poor of Aran Alley weren’t people unrelated to him.

They were people who will definitely become his supporters and his base one day.

‘A strong general, excellent soldiers, brilliant officers…… they aren’t the only citizens.’

The ordinary people.

From the commoners to the slaves.

They were all citizens that Roan had to take in and walk together with.

‘Of course, I didn’t know that I’d be helped so quickly.’

Roan faintly smiled.

At that moment, Hooke, who was being dragged away by the Amaranth troop, suddenly shouted.

“You sons of b*tchs! When I come back out into the world, I’ll kill all of you bastards of Aran Alley!”

Hooke yelled out ominously.

At the same time, Hooke let out his bloodthirst towards the people of Aran Alley.

Suddenly, Roan, who was walking in front, turned around and directly threw out a fist.

Phgack!

The fist directly hit the tip of Hooke’s chin.

“Kukk!”

The jawbone broke with a single blow.

Roan grabbed Hooke’s head that had turned, and snarled.

“When you come back out into the world? Huhuhu.”

Roan spoke with a cold voice.

An icy light shined in his eyes.

“Perhaps it may be possible in your next life.”

A pause.

“Hick.”

Hooke hiccuped a second later.

With a ghostly white face, his entire body trembled.

Roan tapped Hooke’s head as he looked at him.

‘Trash like you aren’t included in the people I need to take with me.’

The only people who he would go together with were good people.

Of course, just what kind of person a good person meant was only known to Roan.

*****

“You’ve been of great help to us.”

“No. I thought I did, but that doesn’t seem to be so in retrospect.”

Roan and Clay were sitting down facing each other and were chatting.

Clay’s expression was somewhat complex.

When he first found out the Janis information agency’s scheme, he thought that he would save Roan and be a big help.

At first, the events truly proceeded according to his thoughts.

But in fact, he couldn’t be of any help at neither getting the permit to use force within the castle nor catching Janis information agency’s master, Hooke.

Despite talking big about helping to dig out the root, he had done nothing more than cutting off the leaves and the stem.

‘I cannot receive an important position with only this much achievement.’

Clay let out a short sigh.

Roan, who had been watching, pretended to not noticed and changed the topic.

“By the way, how were you so informed about the Janis information agency’s inner circumstances?”

“Ah, that is……’

Clay forcefully smiled and answered.

“It was because I had planted a spy on the inside.”

“A spy?”

When Roan asked again, Clay paused for a moment and then shook his head.

“Now that I think about it, rather than a spy, inside sources should be a better word.”

Roan tilted his head.

Clay continued to speak.

“I had bought over several of Janis agency’s agents and used them to receive info about their internal situation or to omit a few pieces of information from their reports to the agency.”

“Ah……”

Roan quietly exclaimed.

‘So there must’ve been Mr. Clay’s help even in the counterattack plan we prepared in the hunting rounds.’

The reason that the Janis information agency’s reports weren’t properly exchanged during Amaranth troop’s preparation and execution phase must had been all thanks to Clay.

Using the agents he bought over, he had purposely omitted the reports that were sent to Hooke.

“Although personally gathering reports and analyzing them is good, putting a mole on the inside and taking out key information is also a good method.”

Roan nodded at Clay’s words.

“If so……”

Starting with the talk about use of agents, the two debated on a wide area of topics including the Janis information agency and other information agencies, stories about Miller Castle, and of course, about druids.

Eventually, a red sunset began to set outside the window.

‘Has it already been that long?’

As the time went on, Clay’s bold and confident expression began to crack.

‘Why doesn’t he show any sign of trying to take me in?’

He wished that Roan would offer to appoint him first.

After that, he was planning on reluctantly agreeing and then showing off his abilities as much as he wanted to.

But despite talking with each other for an entire day, Roan hadn’t brought up anything related to being appointed.

No, he didn’t even show any desire to.

“Anyway, thank you very much for your help this time.”

Worse, he was even trying to conclude the talk.

Clay quietly stared at Roan with his mouth closed.

Roan was faintly smiling.

It was as if he was daring him to say something if he had anything to say.

‘Hu.’

Clay exhaled a short sigh.

‘In the first place, I’ve already decided to serve Sir Baron Tale.’

Because of that, he had even revealed his identity as a druid.

Clay stood up from his chair and after straightening out his suit, he lowered his head.

“Sir Baron Tale, I should’ve asked you ahead of time, but……”

He continued to speak in a soft and calm voice.

“Would you please take me in as your subordinate? I wish to serve Sir Baron at your side.”

He showed a courteous and polite posture.

But his face was still full of confidence.

Roan looked at that sight and quietly smiled.

A heavy silence fell between them.

‘Perchance, he’ll reject……?’

Clay nervously gulped.

He hadn’t even imagined such a situation.

‘There’s no reason for him to reject a person with as much talent as me, right?’

A ripple appeared within his deep and solid self-esteem.

At that moment, Roan stood up from his chair.

“Truthfully, I would like to ask that of you myself.”

He extended his right hand.

“Mr. Clay, would you please go together with me?”

Roan spoke in a composed voice.

‘Mister Clay, I highly value your talent. But……’

His eyes were calm, clear, and deep.

‘I don’t desire people who are only talented. A good person, I wish you are a good person.’

A small difference.

There was a small difference between how Roan and Clay looked at a person.

Roan sought someone who wasn’t merely talented but was also a good person, and Clay sought someone who wasn’t merely good but was also talented.

Although it did seem to be the same, but there was a clear difference in which quality was held in higher regard.

Clay immediately raised his head and grabbed Roan’s hand.

“Thank you very much. I will use all my abilities for Sir Baron Tale, no, for my lord.”

At those words, Roan smiled as he shook his head.

“No. Please use your abilities not for me, but for the fief’s people.”

This was Roan’s personality and values.

Clay slightly lowered his head.

“Yes, understood. I will do as you have asked.”

The two stared into each other’s eyes for a while and exchanged the complicated looks in their eyes.

The eyes held the same thoughts, similar thoughts, and completely different thoughts.

But neither of them could know just how much of each of those thoughts were within their eyes.

***

Roan entrusted Clay with administration over the Amaranth troop’s rations, weapons, and supplies.

Clay was slightly disappointed that it wasn’t a position as important as he first wished for but comforted himself by saying that it wasn’t so bad for the start of his career as an administrator.

Meanwhile, Hooke and the executives of the Janis information agency’s deeds in prompting Roan’s murder and blackmailing numerous nobles from the shadows were revealed, and they were thus all executed.

At the same time, the scheme of Anthony Holten and the nobles who accompanied him at the hunting grounds to directly murder Roan was confirmed, and they were locked up in jail after being stripped of their nobility.

And during this process, the second prince Tommy Rinse’s standing, who was supported by those nobles, treacherously shook once again.

On the other hand, Roan’s popularity, who spectacularly overcame the danger and instead counterattacked, soared as if to pierce the sky.

Simultaneously, the first prince Simon Rinse’s popularity, who had a close relationship with Roan, also rose.

In this moment, Roan took Clay and Keep’s advice and attacked the various information agencies that moved around and used Miller Castle and its surrounding region as their base.

Luckily, there were information on their misdeeds and illegal activities stored amongst the various information confiscated from the Janis information agency.

Thanks to that, there was no one who objected to or showed any complaint at the Amaranth troop’s raids.

Roan combined the numerous information groups into one and entrusted it to Keep, and because of that, the size of the Amaranth Information squad became bigger than Agens.

“Because the size of the information squad has became significantly great, we cannot run it in an amateurish manner anymore.”

Roan went into deep thought with Keep in front of him.

There was already Agens as the main information group.

In this situation, using the Amaranth information squad in the similar manner was highly inefficient.

‘I planned on making a separate and special troop and use them later, but……’

Roan decided to push forward with a part of his plan that he had prepared a long time ago and carry it out.

He looked at Keep.

“Keep, from here on, we will rename the Amaranth information squad as the Tenebra troop and slightly change its nature.”

“Changing its nature……?”

Keep became nervous.

Although he had led the information squad and raised many achievements, he knew that the Agens led by Chris was several levels above the information squad in terms of information gathering and analysis.

He worried whether the Amaranth information squad, no the Tenebra troop may get disband.

“Although it will continue its information gathering and analysis missions, instead of standard methods, it will become a troop focused on special missions, sabotage, espionage and similar missions.”

It was a so-called the special forces troop.

This was also a troop Ian Phillips would create few years later.

Even in the last life, the troop was so hidden behind veils that there weren’t many known achievements by the group.

Due to that, people also called Ian’s special forces troop the shadow troop.

If Ian Phillips’ right arm was the Agens led by Chris, his left arm was this special forces troop.

“S, special missions, sir?”

Keep stuttered.

His heart jumped at the word special.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“In the numerous wars, battles, and strategies, your and the Tenebra troop’s role will be important.”

“Ah……”

Keep quietly exclaimed.

His heart bubbled up with pride.

Just a moment ago, he was worrying about being disbanded.

‘Tenebra, a troop carrying out special missions.’

His heart beated rapidly.

Keep immediately bowed his head.

“Yes sir! We shall continue to do our best.”

Keep gave a salute full of strength.

Roan cheerfully smiled and tapped Keep’s shoulder.

‘Agens can take the Miller Castle and its surround regions that had became ownerless, and,……’

For the competition for the succession of the crown and the veiled fights between the nobles that will continue from now on, he could send in the Tenebra troop and carry out various sabotage and espionage missions.

The shape of the system was slowly being set.

At that moment.

Knock, knock, knock.

“My lord.”

With the sound of knocking, Austin’s voice came through.

“Come in.”

Roan and Keep lightly glanced at each other and then nodded.

At the same time, the office’s door opened and Austin appeared.

Keep gave a light bow and exited the office.

Austin waited for a moment and then cautiously spoke with a quiet voice.

“We have a guest.”

“Who is it this time?”

Roan calmly asked back.

Without them doing anything, numerous visits and invitations by nobles rained down after the event with Anthony Holten and the Janis information agency.

Austin answered with an odd expression.

“It’s Ms. Viscountess Elva Dionell. If I may add……”

The odd expression became even more peculiar.

“She’s a beautiful woman.”

“Hm?”

Roan, who was glancing over at the papers on top of his desk, creased his forehead.

‘Women? Viscountess Elva Dionell?’

Somehow, the name sounded familiar.

‘Who was it?’

His memory was hazy.

It felt almost within his reach, but not quite.

As if a fog had descended, it was hazy.

“My lord?”

Austin’s voice broke in.

“Ah… yes.”

Roan organized his thoughts a second later and cleaned up a pile of documents.

“Guide her to the reception room.”

“Yes, understood.”

Austin nodded his head and walked on ahead.

Roan straightened his clothes and also headed toward the reception room.

‘Elva Dionell……’

She was definitely a noble he had never met in this life.

No, he hadn’t even heard of her.

‘Then it must mean that I heard the name in the last life……’

It was definitely a familiar name.

Sitting down on a soft leather chair placed on one side of the reception room, Roan entered deep into his thoughts.

At that moment.

Knock, knock, knock.

With the sound of knocking on the door, Austin soon appeared with a beautiful woman.

‘So that woman is Viscountess Elva Dionell.’

He wondered if the memory would come up once he saw her face, but as expected, the fog-like haziness was the same.

However, Roan didn’t make the mistake of falling into deep thought by himself.

He cautiously walked up and slightly bowed his head.

“It is an honor to meet you. I am Roan Tale.”

“Hello. I’m Elva Dionell.”

Her voice was as beautiful as her face.

Austin quickly prepared the tea and exited the reception room.

Roan and Elva sat opposite each other and smiled.

“This is our first meeting, yes?”

Roan carefully asked first.

Elva lightly nodded her head.

“Yes. I did see you several times from afar, but it’s the first time we meet face to face.”

“But somehow, it doesn’t feel like our first meeting.”

Roan spoke with a composed look.

Putting down the teacup she held, Elva replied.

“It’s probably because you heard rumors about us.”

“Rumors?”

“Yes. About a group me and several other nobles had made.”

Roan quietly waited for her next words.

Smiling shyly, Elva continued to talk.

“I belong to a group called 12 Hatchling. It’s a group made up of young nobles of Rinse Kingd……”

When she had spoke up to that point.

“Ah!”

Roan unconsciously exclaimed.

No, that was closer to a sigh.

It felt as if the fog within his head had cleared away.

‘Elva Dionell, to think I would have forgotten the Maiden of Iron and Blood Elva Dionell.’

Finally, the memory of the woman in front of his eyes, Elva, surfaced clearly.

The steel-like women who, for the Rinse Kingdom, cut off the heads of her lover and her sibling-like comrades.

‘After cutting off the head of her lover, she ended her life by suicide.’

It was an event that was set to happen in merely five to six years.

‘Thanks to Elva Dionell, the third prince Kallum Rinse rose to the throne and became the next king……’

Roan’s eyes trembled terribly sharply.

That was because he had met the starting point of the great wave of history.

Chapter 124




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter. Chapter 125 coming in the morning Pacific time.

Update: corrected “viscountess” Elva to “baroness” Elva.

The 12 Hatchling.

A group that later detached the number and called itself Hatchling after its number of members increased.

A group that young nobles of the Rinse Kingdom came together to create, it was a highly progressive faction that promoted the development of the kingdom.

‘Of course, it didn’t last very long.’

Because of that, it was more often called the Dragon Tail rather than the name Hatchling.

Dragon’s Tail. 1

‘For the prince they each followed, they directed their swords at each other.’

And the one who won in that process was the woman in front of his eyes.

She was Elva Dionell, the one who was called the Maiden of Blood and Iron in the last life.

“I wish for Sir Baron to join us, the 12 Hatchling.”

Elva went directly to her point.

Comprehending Roan’s personality, she understood that there was no need to dress up or spin her words.

Roan quietly stared into Elva’s eyes.

‘If I didn’t knew of their future, I would’ve immediately accepted their offer.’

He would have hold hands with the young nobles and dreamt of a brilliant future.

But the Hatchling would tragically fall and crumble apart.

‘There’s a need to be prudent.’

He may just end up putting a sword to his own throat.

‘Of course, the future may have changed, but……’

Everything may have changed due to his intrusion.

But he couldn’t be certain.

Although he had taken numerous actions until now, there were times when the future unfolded in the same exact manner as his last life.

‘Either way, the 12 Hatchling are no doubt brilliant geniuses.’

If possible, he wanted to keep them alive and use them as the foundation of the kingdom.

“That’s a rather sudden offer, so I’m a bit flustered. For now, I will think about it.”

At those words, Elva looked slightly surprised.

‘I thought he would be quick and decisive when making decisions……’

She stared into Roan’s eyes.

The light in his eyes was soft but clear and still.

‘For now, no words would change his mind.’

Roan’s eyes were filled with some kind of unknown determination.

‘It’s as if he knows the future.’

Elva inwardly made a silly thought and giggled to herself.

“Then, do please think about it and tell us your answer.”

“Thank you for your consideration.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

Afterwards, the two exchanged small talk.

And in that process, Roan was once again greatly shocked.

‘She is a genius more astounding than what I had thought.’

He realized that Elva wasn’t simply a smart person.

Not only did she have a rough idea of the events that would happen within the next few years, she even had an approximate outline about technology whose concepts haven’t even been grasped yet.

‘To think a person like this ended her life in suicide without showing her talents to the world.’

If Elva was like this, there was a high possibility that the other young nobles in the 12 Hatchling with her were also geniuses that were much more brilliant than his initial thought of them.

‘I should pay attention to them so that they don’t split apart.’

Of course, he couldn’t know if that would go well.

In the first place, they were people who were like true siblings with each other.

And such a group of people turned their swords on each other in a split moment.

‘That shows just how terrible power is.’

Roan deeply inhaled.

‘I too shouldn’t lose my way.’

It would be bad if he flaunted his status around just because he became a noble.

‘Since I don’t want to be just an average noble or a so-so monarch.’

A light was slowly shining in his eyes.

It was a light reaffirming his determination.

“I had fun chatting with you today.”

At that moment, Elva brightly smiled and stood up from her seat.

“I had fun as well.”

Roan stood up as well and gave a slight bow.

Elva then moved her feet and exited the reception room.

Roan saw her off until the outside the residence and only then did he return to his office.

Austin, who was following behind Roan, asked with a playful look.

“Is it really fine like this?”

“What do you mean?”

Roan tilted his head.

Austin replied while cheerily smiling.

“Is it Princess Aily or Ms. Baroness Dionell?”

“Kuk.”

For an instant, Roan unconsciously gulped.

With a twisted face, he looked at Austin.

Roan’s eyes shook sharply as if to tell him to not say something so strange.

But Austin brightly smiled and shrugged instead.

I will continue to watch.

It looked as if he was saying that.

Roan let out a short sigh and shook his head.

‘Ridiculous.’

Right now, women were luxury to him. 2

He had that much work to do.

He walked towards the office.

But when he took the first step.

‘Eh?’

For an instant, a girl’s face passed through his head.

‘Why?’

Roan’s face turned red as if he was flustered.

And Austin didn’t miss that look.

Raising his shoulders up high, Austin smiled brightly.

See.

It looked as if he was saying so.

*****

While he was focusing on the intelligence units’ coordination work and training, the pass to the palace library that he had been waiting for finally arrived.

Unexpectedly, the process of issuing the pass, which Princess Katy thought easily of, was rather strict.

To that extent, the books stored in the library were invaluable and important.

‘Although it took longer than expected, I most likely wouldn’t have even been included in the screening if not for Princess Katy.’

Holding the pass, Roan headed towards the library.

And instead of impatiently opening up old or rare books, he meticulously looked over the library’s interior and its architecture.

‘Ah! So that’s how you store books.’

Roan planned to raise an academy and a library once he went back to the Tale Barony.

But truthfully, he knew nothing about libraries.

Because of that, he planned to carefully examine how the kingdom’s best library was organized and managed.

The problem was.

‘I’m not a genius.’

It was absolutely impossible to clearly and explicitly memorize the library’s structure, organization, and its look.

There was a method of writing down or drawing the library’s interior structure, but that on its own took too much time.

And furthermore, he would had to additionally have its contents checked whether it is information that was allowed to be taken out.

‘Normal people wouldn’t have a suitable method, but……’

Roan faintly smiled.

To him, there was one special method.

Roan glanced around himself once and held his left hand in front of him.

Suddenly, the cheap-looking ring he was wearing on his index finger glinted and shined a light.

Paat!

And at the same time, a faint light spread out all around him.

The tip of Roan’s mouth slowly went up.

‘Brent’s Ring has the ability to not only record writings and pictures, but also the surrounding space and landscape.’ 3

Recording merely a tiny office was the limit due to his low level of mana until now, but thanks to tirelessly training the Flamdor Mana Technique, he was now at a level where he could easily record the insides of the palace library or a large mansion.

Paat!

Brent’s Ring continued to shine a faint light.

Roan scrupulously walked around the palace library and flawlessly recorded each and every sight without missing even one.

‘And if I were to even record the contents of the ancient documents, precious files, and important books too……’

It would be a great asset to the library that would later be built in the Tale Barony.

Ssssk.

Once recording the library’s inner space was finished, Brent’s Ring once again returned to being a cheap-looking ring.

With a satisfied expression on his face, Roan glanced once at the ring and then headed towards the shelves located the furthest inside the library.

In front of a shelf stacked tightly with precious data and books.

Roan put on the clean gloves he had prepared beforehand and carefully took out several books.

‘If possible, I would like to sit here and slowly read through them all, but……’

He didn’t have the leisure for that.

At the moment, the situation in Miller Castle and the palace were like the calm before a storm.

‘Right now, it’s impossible to know when and what will happen any moment.’

Roan planned to store as many books as possible inside Brent’s Ring.

He put down the books on the grand table between the bookshelves.

‘Let’s start.’

Taking out a book, Roan carefully turned the book page by page starting from its cover.

Whenever a page was turned, Brent’s Ring flashed and shined a light.

‘Huu.’

Like that, Roan stored, no stole, the contents of the palace library’s precious books without anyone knowing.

The real treasure that couldn’t be bought or measured slowly piled on and on within Roan’s ring.

*****

“Huu.”

Roan exhaled a long sigh.

A red sunset set on the western sky.

Today as well, he had went to the palace library as soon as the sun was up and recorded the contents of numerous books into Brent’s Ring until the sun had set.

‘Brent’s Ring is also almost at its limit.’

Although the ring’s recording ability was extremely useful, there was a definite limit.

First of all, there was a limit to the amount it could record, and although it was possible to see the recorded contents, it was impossible to move them somewhere else.

‘In the end, I will have to write down the contents inside the ring one by one.’

Just doing that work would need a significantly long time.

Glancing at the sun disappearing below the sunset, Roan hurried his steps.

Once the sun falls, the palace’s gate will close.

And once that happens, he would helplessly have to spend the night in the cramped guard’s station.

‘If I want train the mana technique, fighting technique, and the spear, I’ll have to hurry.’

He spent the time inside the palace library while the sun was up and did various kinds of training during the night.

Although it may seem like a rather simple schedule, it was quite a tiring work.

He even reduced his eating and sleeping hours as much as possible to save time.

“It was quite close today as well, sir.”

The palace guards brightly smiled and lowered their heads.

Smiling cheerily, Roan waved his hand.

“I’ll hurry a bit more tomorrow.”

“Hahaha. It’s already been the thirtieth time that you said those words.”

The guards laughed aloud and saluted.

Once Roan went out, the palace gate that had been widely open closed shut.

“Hu.”

Roan once again let out a short sigh.

Today as well, he had finished the first work of the day.

‘Of course, there’s still much more work left to do.”

Roan chuckled to himself and walked towards his residence.

At that moment.

“Aren’t you perhaps Sir Baron Tale?”

A heavy but clear and confident voice rang out.

Most of all, the voice was slightly playful.

Roan turned his head towards the owner of the voice.

‘Who?’

The owner of the voice wasn’t a man of incredible beauty, but a young man with a face that naturally attracted a favorable impression.

“Yes. I am Roan Tale.”

When Roan lightly bowed, the young man immediately came up and deeply lowered his head.

“It’s an honor to meet the hero of the expedition, Sir Baron Roan Tale. I am called Clyde and I run a small company.

The young man, his identity was none other than Clyde.

He was the young man who was analyzing who amongst the Rinse Kingdom’s princes would become the next king.

That man had suddenly appeared.

“Clyde……?”

Roan slightly creased his forehead.

“Clyde……”

His head quickly spun.

Momentarily, an old memory resurfaced.

‘The great merchant who supported Prince Kallum was named Clyde.’

It was a name that he usually would have forgotten.

But thanks to Elva Dionell who visited him recently, he was able to quickly realize Clyde’s identity.

‘An extremely talented merchant, he didn’t hold back in giving financial support to Prince Kallum.’

Thanks to that, Kallum was able to bypass his two brothers and rise to the throne.

However, Clyde’s life after that actually turned upside down.

Even though the prince he invested in became the king, his business walked a constant path of decline and eventually went out like a flame.

‘It was perfectly eaten away by Goldmaster Sale.’

In a sense, he was a pitiful man.

Since he became homeless even after his investment succeeded.

“If it’s Clyde company, isn’t it one of the many companies that are recently growing the fastest?”

“Ah! To recognize a worthless company like us, thank you very much.”

With a rather excessive gesture, Clyde scratched the back of his head.

“I had a business at the palace and was on my way back. It seems my luck is good today. To meet such a famous person too. Hahaha. The recent thing with the Janis information agency was really amazing too. Wherever I go, there’s only talk about Sir Baron these days. Hahaha.”

He was loud.

And he was talkative.

Yet within those countless words, there was in fact no substance.

Roan didn’t get washed away or become flustered by Clyde’s words.

‘Even though I may look like a mere twenty years old brat, I am in fact a seasoned forty year old man.’

He had experiences that weren’t easily shaken.

‘His calm.’

Clyde, who watched Roan’s reaction, awkwardly smiled and coughed.

“Hm. Hm. It seems I got a bit too excited. Anyhow, it really is an honor.”

He instantly changed his attitude.

Clyde was certainly a gifted merchant.

His analysis of the situation was quick.

“Hu. If I could, I would like to move somewhere else and have a long talk, but……”

His voice was full of regret.

“Since I am out today for business reasons, the circumstance isn’t quite good. If possible, I would like to invite you at a later date, but would that be fine?”

“Yes. If the time is good, I would definitely like to have a chat with you.”

Roan lightly nodded his head.

Clyde then brightly smiled and brushed down his chest.

“Ah! That’s good. I will schedule the time from my side. Then, I will soon send you an invitation.”

“Please do.”

Roan cheerfully smile and nodded.

After that, Clyde said goodbye multiple times then soon walked towards his fellow company merchants who were waiting behind him.

Roan quietly stared at his Clyde’s back.

‘He looks like a bright and good person, but feels rather unpleasant for some reason.’

This kind of feeling, he recently felt it once.

‘Although the degree is different, it’s a similar feeling to when I met Clay.’

In that time, Clyde, who had returned to his fellow merchants, erased his fool-like smile and made an odd smile.

“Meeting Baron Tale is an unexpected profit.”

“How was he now that you met him face to face?”

Clyde’s right hand as well as his retainer, Goden, quietly asked.

At those words, Clyde thinly closed his eyes.

He fell into a short contemplation.

A moment later, he casually spoke.

“It seems I’ll have to make connections with Baron Tale.”

“Is he that great of a person?”

Goden creased his brows.

Roan and Clyde hadn’t talk about anything special and even that duration was notably short.

It was a situation simply not enough to gauge his personality or talent.

As if he had read Goden’s thoughts, Clyde snickered as he answered.

“Just feel like it. For now, I think I’ll have to make a connection with him to feel safe.”

His special merchant’s instinct shined.

He looked at Goden as he stretched.

“My back is kinda stinging from Baron Tale’s gaze. Let’s quickly move somewhere else.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Goden answered and waved his hand.

Soon afterwards, the entire group slowly began to move.

Making a fool-like smile once again, Clyde looked back at Roan.

He silently mouthed that he would definitely send the invitation and quickened his pace while walking backwards.

With a composed face, Roan stared at Clyde and his group of merchants walking further away.

‘I suddenly end up meeting a person I wasn’t even thinking about.’

The main characters of history were slowly gathering around his surroundings.

The fact that most of them were people who put Kallum Rinse onto the throne especially bothered him.

‘I’ll have to think about how to deal with them.’

Roan walked towards his residence as he organized his complicated thoughts.

“My lord.”

Austin who was walking back and forth in front of the residence lowered his head.

“Why are you outside?”

“We have a guest.”

“A guest?”

Roan creased his forehead.

Since he began going to the palace library, he hadn’t personally received any guests.

“Most people would understand the circumstances and go back, but that person refused to move and isn’t moving one bit.”

“Who is that person?”

Austin awkwardly smiled at Roan’s words and answered.

“It’s a middle-aged man named Dante. He says he is a vice-head of a company, but it’s a company we’ve never heard of.”

“Hmm.”

Roan swallowed back a sigh.

If Austin doesn’t know of it, it must mean that it’s a very small or worthless company.

‘But since he earnestly waited until the sun fell down, I can’t simply turn him away.’

Roan walked into the house.

“Where is he right now?”

“He’s waiting in the reception room.”

“I’ll go meet him directly.”

Roan nodded his head and headed towards the reception room.

When he opened the door that was closed and walked in, he saw a middle-aged man sitting on one of the chairs.

‘So this person is Dante?’

Roan’s eyes glinted and shone with light.

The middle-aged man, Dante, was sitting regally with his back perfectly straight and drinking tea.

His posture was so straight, even Roan who was simply watching him felt like putting strength into his waist and back.

“Ah! Sir Baron Tale.”

Dante saw Roan and quickly stood up.

His movement was exceptionally graceful and exuded elegance.

He slightly bowed down and gave a faint smile.

Roan bowed down as well and extended his right hand.

“I am Roan Tale. I heard you have been waiting all day. I apologize for that.”

“No. I came here without an appointment, so I must apologize.”

Dante softly shook his hand.

Roan offered him a seat and sat on the opposite chair.

“I heard you were a vice-head of a company.”

“Yes. I run a small company.”

Dante courteously answered then took out a letter from his chest pocket.

“Our head wishes to work together with Sir Baron Tale. Although we are but a small and nameless company, our potential to grow doesn’t fall behind any company out there.”

He spoke with a polite but confident voice.

Roan took the letter and asked in a quiet voice.

“May I ask what the company’s name is?”

At those words, Dante awkwardly smiled and answered.

“You probably wouldn’t have heard of it. We are called the Sale Company and are currently trading in the Kingdom’s south……”

When he had spoken up to that point.

Roan didn’t even think of opening the letter and reflexively spoke.

“Let’s work together.”

“Yes?”

Dante asked with a surprised expression.

Roan’s face brightly blushed.

“I said let us work together.”

At those words, Dante spoke with a confused look.

“We, we aren’t a big company yet, so will it really be okay to make up your mind so quickly?”

Roan nodded his head.

“Yes.”

A short and fresh answer.

It was an obvious choice.

‘The Sale Company that plays with the kingdom’s south. It is definitely the company that Goldmaster Sale leads.’

Goldmaster Sale, who would go on to control 70% of the Rinse Kingdom’s commerce from now on.

Sale, who even his identity was hidden behind a veil, had approached him first.

‘There’s nothing to contemplate or judge.’

For now, just grab the hand.

That was Roan’s assessment and conclusion.

Once again, he looked at Dante and spoke up with a confident and strong voice.

“Let’s work together.”

Chapter 125




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter.

Goldmaster Sale.

The reason he or she could control 70% of the Rinse Kingdom’s commerce was thanks to his brilliant talent, but that wasn’t the whole story.

At the time when the political landscape was in chaos, there were merchants who showed prominence as fast as, no faster than, Sale.

But the reason that Goldmaster Sale was able to bypass those prominent merchants and become the leader of the commerce was.

‘Everyone wanted Sale.’

Usually, people tend to feel a certain repulsion towards those greater than them.

Especially for people like Sale who dominated more than 70% of the kingdom’s commerce, it was obvious that they would become a target of envy, resentment, and veiled enmity.

Naturally, the person would receive intense opposition and it would become hard to expand his or her influence beyond a certain point.

It was something that happened regardless of one’s ability.

But Sale was different.

Besides a few fanatical competitors, most of the kingdom’s citizens admired and loved Sale.

That was because Sale wasn’t simply focused on making money.

He or perhaps she was a person who knew how to give.

‘Thanks to him, the Rinse Kingdom’s citizens could, to a certain degree, live a manageable life.’

A home to those who lost their homes.

Something to eat for those with nothing to eat.

He healed the injured for free and provided financial support.

If it wasn’t for Sale, a much greater number of people would have lost their lives.

‘If the Sale in this life is the Sale that I know of……’

There was no reason to grab his hand.

But.

‘Like how the future can change, a person’s personality could also change.’

But he couldn’t possibly miss the enormous opportunity called Sale because of such a dubious reason.

Instead.

‘Although I will hold hands with them, I should do so carefully.’

He planned to leave room so that he could back off anytime.

“Then, what kind of work do you plan to do with us?”

At those words, Dante answered without any hesitation.

“Firstly, the Sale Company handles various grains including wheat and corn.”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

‘It’s as expected.’

Even in the last life, although not at the current time, the Sale Company’s business was focused around grains when the company began to spread its name.

“If you are willing, we wish to build a large scale granary in the Tale Barony.”

The Sale Company planned to make Tale Barony as their base for grain trading in the kingdom’s north.

Typically, it was an offer that he would immediately accept.

But Roan inwardly shook his head.

‘We will prepare cereal related business separately from our side.’

He planned to buy the Istel Kingdom’s wheat fields in wholesale, and personally grow and harvest crops.

Running the same business would be a loss.

Roan had something else planned.

“I’m sorry, but we already have a separate job related to grains that is being prepared.”

“Ah…… is that so?”

Dante awkwardly smiled and asked back.

Roan nodded his head.

“Yes. Instead, what do you think about investing in a transportation business instead of the cereal business?”

“A transportation business?”

Even at the unexpected counter proposal, Dante was calm.

“Yes. I plan to repair the roads throughout the fief and create a new transportation network.”

For a while, Roan calmly explained a part of the plan he had.

Creating a well-maintained and complex transportation network was something that would be processed in the Estia Empire a few years later.

Roan planned to push that plan forward a bit and attempt it in the Tale Barony..

And in the case of the transportation business, because the infrastructure itself would become an asset of the fief, he wouldn’t take a big loss even if Sale wasn’t a benevolent person unlike in the last life.

“Hmm.”

Dante, who had been quietly listening to Roan, let out a quiet sigh.

It was an unexpected offer and an unexpected business and it was on an unimaginable scale .

‘Baron Tale. It seems he isn’t simply a powerful warrior.’

He felt that he could more or less understand why the master decided to invest in him.

“This will have to be checked with the Sale Company’s master, yes?”

Roan probingly asked.

If the chance appeared, he was planning to try and have a meeting with him.

However, Dante then smiled brightly and shook his head.

“Thankfully, he gave me full authority concerning this contract.’

He contemplated for a moment, then nodded his head.

“We will accept Sir Baron Tale’s offer.”

It was a straightforward decision.

But Roan didn’t back down easily.

“Even so, wouldn’t it be better to meet the master at least once since it’s a rather a large business venture?”

He wanted to meet Sale at least once.

That was his honest feeling.

Dante made a bit troubled expression and then exhaled a short sigh.

“I’m sorry. The master is unable to easily go out at the moment.”

“Is he perhaps unwell?”

“I’m sorry. I am unable to tell you anything more than this.”

Dante repeatedly lowered his head.

Since the situation had come to this, even Roan couldn’t be stubborn and insist any more.

‘Can’t go out easily……?’

Various possibilities went through his head.

But they were all merely speculations and conjectures.

Roan soon threw out the distracting thoughts and extended his hand towards Dante.

“It seems that I’ll have to make an appointment at another time. Anyhow, I look forward to working with you.”

“We also look forward to working with you.”

Dante shook Roan’s hand and lowered his head.

The edge of Roan’s mouth slowly went up.

‘A completely unexpected melon rolled in completed with the vine.’ 1

Truthfully, he had been slightly worried due to having too many projects and plans that he had to start.

But with the Sale Company investing in the transportation network project which needed the most funding, he had less to worry about.

Also.

‘If we keep working together like this, the day I meet Goldmaster Sale should come too.’

The person whose identity nobody knew.

For some reason, Roan’s heart beat rapidly.

It wasn’t a sort of simple anticipation.

It felt as if waiting for a lover.

It was a feeling as if waiting for a fated partner.

*****

Paat! Pat!

Following the thrusted fist and kick, sounds of impacts exploded out.

At the small training field behind the residence, Roan was engrossed in training the Flamdor Mana Technique and Reid’s Art of Fighting.

Tat!

Kicking off the ground and jumping up, he threw out consecutive punches.

Paang!

Along with the sound of impact, the countless number of fists created an afterimage.

And at the same time.

Pat! Pat! Pat!

A fist sized light repeatedly appeared and disappeared around Roan.

The clump of light flashed out of nowhere in between the gracefully linked fist techniques.

If there was an enemy warrior in front of Roan, he would have tightly closed his eyes at the light or mess up his movements.

‘And through that gap, I’ll strike with my fist!’

Pang!

His clothes shook in the wind as the sound of impact exploded out.

The clump of light certainly flashed in front of Roan’s eyes from time to time, but his sight wasn’t blinded or darkened thanks to Kalian’s Tears.

Pang! Pabang!

Roan continued to move without a pause.

This time, a strange light wrapped around his two legs and two fists.

Because the light was very faint, it was at a degree where it was unnoticable if one didn’t look close.

“Huu.”

A moment later, Roan exhaled a long sigh and calmed his breathing.

He looked down at Brent’s Ring on his index finger.

“Among the numerous spells in the ring, it seems the ones I can effectively use are only the light spell and the shield spell.”

Roan had repeatedly researched how to utilize the light spell and the shield spell in a battle or a duel, and the result was the current fighting style.

‘I have to quickly master other spells such as magic missile, blink, and reverse gravity.’

He felt regretful at how he hadn’t been actively using Brent’s Ring until now.

‘Kalian’s Tears and Brent’s Ring. Flamdor Mana Technique and Reid’s Art of Fighting.’

Each and every one of them were splendid artifacts and skills.

However.

‘It’ll be too disappointing to lose the spearmanship.’

The spearmanship that Roan currently learned were the old Pierce’s spearmanship, the current Roan’s spearmanship, and various spearmanship learned from actual battles.

There was no powerful spearmanship that fit together with the Flamdor Mana Technique.

‘Even in the last life, there was no spearmanship that was especially prominent.’

If he were to choose at least one, there was Baker’s spearmanship that Pierce had created by advancing Viscount Reil Baker’s spearmanship, but that didn’t exist at this time and even if it did possibly exist, he couldn’t possibly learn it as he wished.

‘In the end, do I have to personally make one like Pierce did……’

If he were to combine the tens of spearmanship he knew, it felt like it could somehow work.

‘Of course, it won’t be easy.’

When he thought up to that point.

“My lord!”

From behind the building, Austin appeared with a hurried voice.

“My lord. It’s an urgent news. Here’s President Chris’ reporting letter.’

Austin quickly ran up and handed him the papers.

Roan quickly looked through the letter’s content.

“Hmm.”

Immediately, a quiet sigh leaked out of his mouth.

The letter’s content began with a very simple sentence.

Viscount Elton Coat has started a rebellion.

*****

“Is that so? So it happened as I had expected.”

Said the calm voice.

Instead of being shocked, Simon even made a faint smile.

“Anyway, the strength of Baron Tale’s intelligence force is truly amazing. To think you’ll be able to learn of a news all the way from the kingdom’s north so quickly.”

“As expected, were you aware that Viscount Elton Coat would start a rebellion?”

Roan made a bitter smile.

As soon as he received Chris’ reporting letter, he went to find Simon.

Although he had passed the news of Elton’s rebellion, Simon’s expression looked as if he was waiting for it instead.

Simon faintly smiled as he shook his head.

“No. It wasn’t that I was waiting……”

His smile became deeper.

“I simply kept such a possibility in my mind.”

He moved stacks of documents to one side and stared directly at Roan.

“Baron Tale. Please keep quiet about Elton’s revolt for now.”

Roan slightly creased his brows.

Simon playfully smiled and continued to talk.

“Since we will be able to freely create a more advantageous field for us until the news of his revolt reaches the palace. Got it?”

“Yes. Understood.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

In the first place, he couldn’t reject Simon’s order.

Roan saluted Simon and exited the office.

‘It’s as Clay had expected. The prince was waiting for Elton to start a rebellion.’

In the first place, it was strange.

Although Simon had trembled and raged at Elton’s betrayal, he in fact took no action.

‘Most likely, he secretly pressured that Elton.’

Roan bit down on his lower lip.

Simon probably planned to use this rebellion as a chance to greatly widen the gap between him and the other princes.

‘The palace will become noisy.’

A rebellion wasn’t something to go over easily.

Most likely, a large scale suppression force would be made.

‘The question is from which prince’s faction the suppression force will come from……’

To take the vanguard position of the suppression force, Simon would start setting the board from now on.

Roan deeply inhale.

‘It looks like blood will be spilled once again.’

A corner of his heart uncomfortably ached.

And furthermore, Elton’s revolt this time didn’t happen in the last life.

Because of that, Roan too had to think about what to do multiple times over and move prudently.

‘Somehow, this event feels like it will be the big turning point for me.’

He felt such a feeling.

The wind that had momentarily stopped began to blow again.

That was the wind of the battlefield that Roan felt profoundly familiar with and liked.

*****

“A transportation business……?’

From the inner space hidden by a soft cloth, a soft and clear voice echoed.

“Yes. Prin, no Master.”

The middle-aged man on the outside of the space lowered his head as he answered.

A graceful and elegant movement.

The middle-aged man was no other than Sale Company’s vice-president, Dante.

For a while, he explained Roan’s transportation business project in detail.

As soon as his story finished.

“As expected, my eyes weren’t wrong.”

The voice quietly muttered.

A moment of silence later, the clear and soft voice once again spoke up.

“Okay. I’ll leave the full authority for the job this time to Dante. Judge the work and make the decisions on your own.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Dante softly smiled as he answered.

He instinctively felt that this job would be a big opportunity for him.

‘Sir Baron Tale is an exceptional person.’

If they were to combine their strengths, he was confident that he could grow the Sale Company by tens of times larger than now.

Dante bowed and said his goodbye, then exited the office.

Kwumpth.

When the door closed, a voice full of happiness resounded from the other side of the soft cloth.

“See. Wasn’t I right?”

A question thrown at someone unseen.

A middle-aged woman’s voice soon followed.

“What did I say? As for me, I always……”

When she had spoke up to that point.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Sounds of knocking rang out.

“It is time to go to the academy.”

It was a heavy and low voice.

At those words, the soft cloth that had been dividing the space completely opened wide.

Following that, a busy hurrying sound was heard.

“Aaah. Slow down. You’ll hurt yourself like that.”

The middle-aged woman followed her around and endlessly spoke to slow her down.

But the young woman who was moving ahead of her didn’t slow down her steps.

Each and every single movement of her hand and feet was cheerful and lively.

She felt really good right now.

But the problem was.

‘Why do I feel so happy?’

She too didn’t knew the reason why.

*****

Sarac. Sarac.

A sound of softly turning the pages of a book echoed.

Roan was carefully looking over a thick book while standing in one side of the library.

‘This book should be the last.’

There was no more storage space left in Brent’s Ring.

No, there was a bit of room, but he wanted to leave it alone in case of an unexpected event.

‘Anyhow, has the news of Elton’s rebellion still not spread?’

The palace was still quiet.

Thanks to that, Roan did as Simon asked and entered the palace library in the morning and trained at night as usual.

‘It’s a peaceful daily life, but something could happen at anytime.’

Because of that, he had ordered the Amaranth troop to be on the guard so that they could go to war at any time.

Sarac. Sarac

The book’s pages turned almost habitually.

And in each and every time, a light flashed from Brent’s Ring.

“Hm?”

Roan, who had been mindlessly turning the pages, suddenly stopped.

A familiar picture appeared in front of his eyes.

“This is……”

In the book, a stick about a foot long was drawn.

It was a command baton used by generals or commanders.

“This is the command baton Pierce used in the last life……”

Because he had seen it several times before from a distance, he clearly remembered it.

Roan touched the words next to the picture with his finger.

Grand Commander’s Command Baton.

“Hmm.”

A quiet sigh leaked out.

Grand Commander was a special rank used only for a limited time when the kingdom was in danger.

‘When the Great Warring Era continued on for a long time, Pierce also took on the nation’s will and was appointed as the Grand Commander.’

The old memories resurfaced.

On the page, there was an explanation about the baton.

On the top of the Grand Commander’s Command baton lies the gem that the Rinse Kingdom’s founding king, Norman Von Rinse, received from the Golden Dragon Lord Europas as a present.

The gem was also clearly drawn in the picture.

‘I thought it was simply gold since it had a gold color……’

It was truly a precious gem that a dragon lord had gifted.

Roan once again turned his gaze towards the explanation.

In this gem, there is an incredible powe……

At that moment.

Boom!

With an ear-splitting sound, the palace library’s door forcefully opened wide.

“Baron Tale!”

The owner of the booming voice was Viscount Tio Ruin.

With his finger still on the explanation, Roan turned towards Tio.

“What happened, Sir Viscount Ruin?”

At Roan’s question, Tio shouted with an urgent look.

“The news of Elton’s rebellion has reached the palace! The King has summoned all three princes!”

“Ah……”

Roan let out a quiet exclamation.

Tio took a one dry gulp.

“The time has come.”

He tightly clenched his fist.

“The time to once again head out onto the battlefield has come.”

Roan slightly bowed his head.

His heart jumped.

Forcefully pressing down his surging emotions, he moved his feet.

Tio cheerily smiled and went out of the palace library a step ahead of Roan.

Roan quickly followed behind him.

Kwumpth.

A short wind blew as the library’s door closed.

Flap.

The book that was spread on the table flapped from the wind.

Chwareug.

Several pages of the book turned.

Pareureu.

The pages turned chaotically.

The contents were still about the Grand Commander’s Command baton.

The original owner of the gem, Golden Dragon Lord Europas, called this gem Tempestas. When the Tempestas achieves a certain condition, it could cause a very unstable time manipul……

Seureug.

The pages that chaotically flapped fell down once again.

In the page that followed, a completely different topic was explained.

The book was wide open without anyone to see.

And strange silence fell down on top of the book.

Chapter 126




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter.

Edit: Corrected “Viscount Wiggins” to “Baron Wiggins”.

‘Even so, they are princes of a nation, is it?’

Roan stood quietly and watched a heated debate unfolded.

“Your majesty, please allow me to lead the suppression force of this rebellion! I will cut off Elton’s neck and clean off this slander put on me.”

The one who was even showing his vein as he shouted was the Second Prince Tommy Rinse.

“That must not be, your majesty. Whatever the truth may be, the fact that Elton had a close relationship with older brother Tommy has already been widely revealed. We cannot entrust the suppression force’s vanguard position to older brother Tommy in this situation. Instead, I will run there immediately and cut off that bastard’s neck if you entrust it to me.”

The one who spoke up after him was the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

‘The second prince and the third prince also knew that Elton would do something.’

Roan calmly breathed.

He eyed the nobles who were lined up on the two sides of the great hall.

The news of Elton’s revolt had only arrived at the palace today.

But on the faces of the nobles who supported and followed Tommy and Kallum, there were no signs of panic or anger.

‘They’re all quite good.’

Simon wasn’t the only one setting the stage.

However feeble they may look, they were the princes of a nation.

As expected, Tommy and Kallum had also made their own preparations.

At that moment, Simon, who was staying quiet until now, stepped up.

Unlike the other two princes, he was calm and full of leisure.

“Your majesty. Please leave the suppression force to me. Conveniently, the Regate troop under me is currently holding a military exercise.”

His voice became stronger.

“We could march right this moment. Furthermore, Elton is a man who attempted to take my life. I wish to personally make him answer for that sin.”

Simon bowed slightly.

Unlike Tommy and Kallum who shouted and intensely gestured about, he was remarkably calm.

The feverishly heated hall cooled down cold due to him.

‘I have already been preparing for this since ten days ago.’

Using a large scale military exercise as an excuse, he had made preparations to march at any moment.

Not only that, the necessary supplies for war had already been readied.

If the selection for the suppression force didn’t seem to flow towards an undesirable direction, he planned to show off his cards one by one.

At that moment, King Deni Von Rinse, who had been watching the scene from above the throne, made an odd smile.

“All of your thoughts for the kingdom are truly praiseworthy.”

He spoke with a voice that was seemingly majestic but looked down on them.

Sneaking a glance at the dukes standing near the throne, he continued to talk with a composed face.

“Truthfully, I would like to make all three princes the suppression force, but……”

Deni III slightly creased his brows.

“You all have just finished the monster expedition and came back only recently. As a father, I cannot send you children out onto the battlefield once again.”

“Hm?”

Instantly, all three princes including Simon widely opened their eyes.

No, that was also the same for the nobles who were lined up at the sides.

‘Just now, what……’

‘But I thought that the suppression force would obviously be led by one of the three princes?’

‘Even though I expected him to make this into one of contests for the succession of the throne.’

‘This is a completely unexpected decision.’

The faces of the three princes and the nobles turned rigid from shock.

All the while, the only person who was full of leisure, was Duke Francis Wilson.

‘You’re doing well. Your Majesty.’

He looked at Deni III while smiling faintly.

Coincidentally, Deni III also turned his gaze and met Francis’ eyes.

That was for a brief moment too short for anyone to notice.

But there was one person who didn’t miss this scene and completely caught it.

‘The relationship between his majesty the king and Sir Duke Francis Wilson is unusual.’

That was no other than Roan, who had been using Kalian’s Tears and didn’t miss a single thing happening within the hall.

‘Duke Francis Wilson……’

There was nothing special that came up even when he searched his old memories.

Even when Deni III suddenly died and Kallum Rinse became the next king, he maintained his title as a duke.

‘I only remember him living an uneventful life, but……’

He didn’t cause any specific event that would impact the political landscape.

At least, that was how it seemed to Roan who was merely a common spearman in the last life.

‘But that may not be so.’

The lights in the eyes of Deni III and Francis were definitely unusual.

‘It seems the politics of the kingdom is flowing more complicatedly than I had thought.’

Roan let out a short sigh.

The royal family and the palace were full of things he didn’t knew of.

“Your majesty. I am fine. I am ready to devote my mind and body to the kingdom!”

Simon shouted as he bowed down.

Following him, Tommy and Kallum too shouted with ardent voices.

“Please entrust it to me.”

“I’m confident that I can succeed.”

But Deni III shook his head with a firm look.

“No, the three princes will be excluded from this suppression force.”

“Ah……”

Quiet cries of exclamation came from all over the hall.

The situation flowed in a completely unexpected direction.

Simon especially looked greatly shocked. Especially Simon, who looked really disturbed.

‘Damn it. Not even one of the three, but none of the three are allowed.’

He hadn’t expected at all that the rebellion suppression force, which was of monumental importance, would be left to someone else rather than the princes.

The mood in the hall became disquieted.

But Deni III didn’t pay any mind and continued to speak with a calm look.

“But this important duty cannot be entrusted to anyone. Thus, I will take nominations from the three princes for suitable candidates.”

“Hm?”

Once again, everyone made confused expressions.

Bizarre and simply inconceivable words poured out of Deni III’s mouth.

When everyone was making utterly confused expressions.

“Is there a reason as to why we are specifically picking a candidate through nominations?”

Francis, who had been staying quiet until now, cautiously asked.

As if he was waiting for it, Deni III answered.

“With the suppression of the rebellion this time, I plan to test the three princes’ eye for people. For one to lead a nation, he must have a discerning eye to set apart the talented from the mediocre. This time, I plan to see what kind of achievement the candidates the three princes nominate raises. Like the last expedition, I will gift a great reward to the prince who shows the most excellent eye.”

“Ah……”

Quiet exclamations leaked out.

In short, one would become a step closer to the title of Grand Duke of Grain if he achieved a great merit in the suppression of the rebellion.

“Each of you three princes, nominate your candidate.”

Deni III’s voice echoed throughout the hall.

Immediately, Simon, Tommy, and Kallum’s heads turned towards one place.

Edwin Voisa, Bradley Webster, Liss Kowan, and Francis Wilson.

The one place where the four dukes were standing.

Deni III made an odd smile at that sight.

“I shall give you some time to think.”

As soon as his words ended, the three dukes, Edwin, Bradley, and Liss, walked towards the princes.

Each separating into a different corner of the hall, the three princes formed a circle with the nobles who supported them.

“This was completely unexpected outcome.”

“Now is not the time to question that. A candidate, we need to find a candidate.”

Hurried discussions passed back and forth.

At that moment.

“Your majesty.”

The Second Prince Tommy Rinse went up to Deni III and kneeled down on one knee.

“I nominate the firstborn of Duke Voisa’s house, Mills Voisa.”

At the same time, a young man showed himself from a group of nobles.

He was Mills Voisa, the firstborn of Edwin Voisa and the one who was studying abroad in the Estia Empire.

His toned body and handsome face stood out.

“Oh.”

Deni III let out a quiet exclamation.

“It seems there are many talented individuals around Tommy. To think he would nominate a candidate so quickly……”

His praises continued on.

And due to that, Simon and Kallum’s expressions turned urgent.

“Sir Duke Webster. Is Bary still not here?”

Barry Webster was the firstborn of Bradley Webster and was deployed to the Diez Kingdom as an ambassador.

At Simon’s urgent question, Bradley made a bitter smile.

“Although he has arrived near Miller Castle, he is lacking as a candidate for this event even if he comes back. Since he is more of an administrator than a warrior.”

“Um.”

Simon creased his brows.

And at that moment.

“I nominate the second son of Duke Kowan’s house, Chester Kowan.”

Kallum stood in front of Deni III and kneeled down on one knee.

A young man with a build as large as Mills walked up next to him.

Chester Kowan was the second son of Liss Kowan and was on a mission as an expeditionary commander in the Aimas Union.

“Oh. Kallum has also found a candidate much faster than I expected. Then, is Simon the only one left?”

Deni III cheerily smiled and looked at Simon.

It was a smile that seemingly didn’t hold any special meaning, but it put almost suffocating pressure on Simon.

His face brightly blushed.

At that moment, Viscount Tio Ruin opened his mouth.

“I will go. I will go cut Elton’s neck and raise the greatest merit.”

“Hm?”

For a moment, Simon’s expression turned bright.

‘Yes. If it’s Viscount Ruin, I can trust him and entrust the work to him.’

But Bradley soon creased his brows and shook his head.

“Even though bright and promising young men came out from those sides, for a warrior who already spread his name to step up is a bit……’

Tio was a well-known warrior even in the Rinse Kingdom.

And with his age well-past his prime, he was one of the influential nobles of the kingdom.

“Then how about sending my son……”

“My second son is quite a talented……”

“How about my little brother? Even though he has recently become thirty five……”

The nobles endlessly recommended their sons or family members to catch Simon’s eyes.

But there was not a single person that truly satisfied him.

‘Was there so few talents?’

Simon let out a short sigh.

Although the influences of the nobles who followed him were fierce and powerful, their ages tended to be old.

He absurdly lacked younger talents.

At that moment.

“Excuse me……’

The one who cautiously opened his mouth was a very delicate looking young man.

Feeling the gazes falling down on him, he coughed.

“Hm! Everyone said many individuals, but one person seems to be completely missing.”

An old noble furrowed his brows at those words.

“Baron Wiggins. Who are you talking of?”

The identity of the delicate looking young man was the head of the 12 Hatchling, Sith Wiggins.

He cheerfully smiled and stepped aside.

Suddenly, a young man who was nonchalantly standing behind him appeared.

“Ah!”

Quiet cries of exclamations shot out of multiple nobles’ mouths.

Simon’s face, which had been completely twisted, also turned brilliantly bright.

He cheerily smiled and let out a long sigh.

“Huu. To think I had forgotten about you. Hahaha.”

He couldn’t hold back and let out a quiet laugh.

Simon pointed at the young man who was standing nonchalantly.

“My candidate is you.”

The smile hanging on his mouth became even deeper.

“Baron Roan Tale.”

The young man who was standing indifferently.

He was Roan.

Feeling the gazes pouring down on him, Roan made a faint smile.

Paat!

He gave a short salute.

“I will do my best if you entrust this to me.”

There was no reason to decline.

Not only for Simon, this was also a big chance for him.

Roan slightly turned his head and looked towards Sith Wiggins.

‘This man is the head of the 12 Hatchling and Elva Dionell’s lover.’

Of course, Sith and Elva weren’t lovers yet.

‘I never expected him to recommend me.’

Anyhow, he was able to naturally take on the important duty thanks to Sith.

Roan slightly lowered his head.

Sith also lowered his head while facing Roan and smiled.

His expression looked as if it was saying it looked forward to working with him.

“Is Prince Simon not ready yet?”

Coincidentally, he heard Deni III’s voice.

Simon went up to the throne and kneeled down on one knee.

“I nominate Baron Roan Tale.”

At the same time, Roan walked up next to Simon.

The sight of him kneeling on one knee and bowing his head looked truly confident.

“Oh……”

Deni III let out a quiet exclamation.

That was also the same for the various nobles who followed Tommy and Kallum.

Although they didn’t show it, they had expected Simon to nominate a son from an upper noble house or a relatively young viscount.

‘To think he would nominate a rookie who just became a noble.’

‘Although Baron Tale raised exceptional merits from the expedition, he wouldn’t be a match for Mills and Chester.’

‘Is it a competition between the sons of upper nobles’ houses who received all kinds of education from birth and a novice noble who came up from the bottom?’

Sneers hung from the faces of numerous nobles.

On the other hand, Simon was overflowing with confidence.

‘I’m confident that Baron Tale can do this well.’

He trusted Roan.

At that moment, Deni III spoke up.

“Then, since the three princes’ nominations are over, we should decide who will be the vanguard, yes?”

Immediately, nervous looks appeared on the faces of the three princes as well as the various nobles.

‘The one taking the vanguard position will be at an advantage.’

‘If we want to raise an even greater merit, we must take the vanguard position.’

Everyone looked at Deni III’s face.

Deni III looked around at the various nobles for a moment and slowly opened his mouth.

“The vanguard of this suppression force will be Mills Voisa……”

“Waa!”

Immediately, the nobles on prince Tommy’s side cheered.

But Deni III”s words weren’t finished yet.

“Chester Kowan……”

“Ah!”

The nobles on the prince Kallum’s side exclaimed a moment later.

A Bright mood waved over their faces.

But Deni III”s words still weren’t finished yet.

“And Baron Roan Tale.”

“Hm?”

For a moment, the three princes and the nobles all creased their foreheads.

They all looked baffled and couldn’t understand the idea of all three being the vanguard.

Deni III cheerfully smiled and continued to speak.

“The three individuals will march to suppress Elton Coat’s rebellion in three days from now. I won’t look at the process. I shall give all the authority and wealth of the Coat Barony to the one who pierces into the fief and cut off his neck first.”

Boom.

Immediately, a great shock shook the hall.

The three princes and the various nobles gulped with shocked faces.

Deni III spoke while still sporting a bright smile.

“I should think that you don’t have time to be like this, no? I definitely said it. I will give everything to the one who pierces into the Coat Barony first and cut his neck. All of you hurry up. The one who hurries will be at an advantage.”

He finished speaking those words and stood up.

Before he exited the great hall, Deni III turned back his head and looked towards Francis.

Francis faintly smiled and slightly nodded his head.

‘Good job, sir.’

For now, the first situation ended the way they intended it to.

‘For now, we avoided the situation where the three princes point their swords at each other. Now, the next thing to do is……’

The light in Francis’ eyes calmly dimmed down.

Meanwhile, the grand chamberlain, Logan Dayle, knocked on the marble floor three times with a large staff.

At the same time, Deni III exited the great hall.

Immediately, an odd silence fell down over the hall.

However, that silence didn’t last very long.

“Quick!”

“Prepare the suppression force as fast as possible!”

“It’s over if we fall behind!”

Shouts exploded out all over the hall.

The nobles who normally liked to keep up ceremonies began to run frantically.

Amongst them, the three princes were also included.

Their faces were utterly serious.

‘We must cut off Elton’s neck.’

Only then could they become even slightly closer to being the Grand Duke of Grain.

“Hurry!”

“Quickly, quickly move!”

The grand great hall was completely filled with noise.

The battle had, no the war had already begun.

And Roan stood at the center of it all.

Chapter 127




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter for Sunday. (I sure hope it’s still Sunday somewhere in the world…)

The capital, Miller, trembled from one rumor.

The suppression force was formed from the nominated candidates of the three princes.

Additionally, a rumor circulated that all of Coat Barony’s authority and wealth will be given to the one who entered the barony first and cut off Elton’s neck.

The residents of Miller Castle didn’t believe these rumors.

The rumors were simply too ridiculous.

But as the two factions of Tommy Rinse and Kallum Rinse called their troops and tore through Miller Castle to gather war supplies, the rumor was revealed to be true.

Of course, because Prince Simon’s faction was unusually quiet and calm, it raised questions in many people.

“This is truly regrettable however I think about it.”

Viscount Tio Ruin smacked his lips.

Simon, who was next to him, bitterly smiled.

“It was unavoidable. It is my father’s, his majesty’s, order after all.”

He let out a short sigh and looked at Roan.

“Baron Tale. I’m counting on you.”

“Yes sir. I shall do my best.”

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

Right now, Roan, Simon, and Tio were chatting in a small garden located at the outer edge of the palace.

Unlike Tommy and Kallum, who were madly running around, they had already finished their preparations to march.

It was all because they had learned the news of Elton Coat’s rebellion ten days earlier than others.

If King Deni Von Rinse hasn’t ordered them to march off on the same day and at same time, Roan would have already led the entire legion and marched north two days ago.

“Huu.”

Simon once again sighed as if he was regretful.

‘Even so, I can’t order the nobles near the Coat Barony to march either.’

Separate from Deni III’s order, he couldn’t order the nobles’ soldiers to march as he wished due to various circumstances.

‘If I’m not careful, nobles who support Tommy and Kallum could invade into the empty fiefs, and……’

As a consequence of the monster expedition that happened right after the war with Istel Kingdom, thieves were on the rise.

If he was to recklessly move the soldiers of the fiefs in this situation, the nobles who supported him could lose their footing instead.

‘Thanks to that, Tommy and Kallum’s sides also can’t move the nobles as they wish.’

In the end, the candidates the three princes nominated, Roan, Mills, and Chester, had to suppress the rebellion as Deni III intended.

“Huu.”

Simon once again exhaled a short sigh because of his complicated feelings.

Roan quietly watched that sight then whispered in a quiet voice.

“Your highness.”

“Yes?”

“It may be possible that there is another reason why his majesty the king has excluded your royal highnesses and left your highnesses in the capital.”

Roan spoke in a very cautious manner.

If interpreted wrongly, his words may sound as if Deni III’s words of worry for his three children were a lie.

Thankfully, Simon correctly understood Roan’s words and feeling.

“I know. There will be a fierce fight here too without a doubt.”

He faintly smiled as he grabbed Roan’s shoulder.

“Don’t worry about here. I’ll do fine on my own.”

“Yes sir. Always be careful please.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

Simon quietly watched him for a while then slowly stood up.

“Viscount Ruin. Should we slowly start to go back?”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Tio quickly stood up and checked his equipment.

Roan too stood up after him.

“In tomorrow’s marching ceremony, we won’t have any time to talk.”

Simon grabbed Roan’s shoulders.

The light in his eyes were passionate.

“Come back safe. I’ll wait in the palace.”

“Yes sir. I will come back with Elton’s head.”

Roan gave a short salute.

Simon brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“As expect, you are trustworthy.”

Those were his honest feelings.

Roan was more trustworthy than the sons of upper nobles like Mills and Chester.

Simon tapped Roan’s shoulder two-three times and walked out of the garden.

Tio lightly said goodbye with his eyes then quickly walked ahead of Simon.

Roan remained in the garden and watched the backs of the two people.

‘If he could control his anger, he is without a doubt an excellent prince.’

That was his honest evaluation of Simon.

But him losing his mind and rampaging once angered was a big problem.

Roan hadn’t realized Simon’s secret yet.

Because of that.

‘I’m not sure whether Prince Simon is suitable as the next King.’

Of course, there was Roan’s rather ambiguous position.

‘Can I truly be a monarch……?’

Becoming a noble and becoming a king were two things on two completely different dimensions.

Roan clenched his fist.

‘Nothing is impossible.’

Although it was a distant goal, he would definitely be able to achieve it if he walked forward step by step.

Also.

‘If one thinks about it, there are many more ways to become a king compared to becoming a noble.’

At the very least, he could start a rebellion like Elton and declare himself as a King.

‘Although the possibility of having my neck cut off will be high if I do it carelessly.’

Roan bitterly smiled.

A cold wind blew from the north.

‘Is it almost the time for winter to arrive……’

It wasn’t quite a good season to start a war.

‘I have to finish it as soon as possible.’

He planned to suppress the rebellion and return to the Tale Barony before the winter truly began.

‘I’ll await the spring there.’

It wasn’t simply the spring of seasons.

It was also the spring of life.

Roan was now ready to bloom.

*****

“It’s been a while. Have you been well?”

“Shut up. You know we aren’t close enough to ask each other that.”

One voice was smooth and the other was sharp.

But the two people’s eyes at least were all cold and sharp.

In the dark room, the two young men sat across a small table and scowled at each other.

The young man who first asked about the other’s health snickered and leaked out a laugh.

“Chester. That personality of yours still seems to be the same.”

“Shut it. Mills, it looks like you’re still putting up that friendly and kind act of yours that’s completely unlike you.”

The two young men’s identity.

They were Mills Voisa and Chester Kowan who were each chosen by Tommy Rinse and Kallum Rinse as candidates for the suppression force.

Mills slightly scrunched his nose.

“What do you mean a friendly act? It’s rather sad if you say it like that. Is Charlie well?”

Although it sounded as if he was affectionately asking someone’s health, his eyes were still icy and sharp.

Chester’s face immediately hardened.

“If you say my big brother’s name one more time, I’ll personally cut off your neck.”

Killing intent blew out.

It was like it could stop one’s breath.

But despite that, Mills’ expression was nonchalant.

“Ah, sorry. That was my bad.”

He raised one hand and showed a clownish smile.

With his still hardened expression, Chester glared at Mills.

Mills quietly watched that glare then once again laughed out.

“Kuk. There’s no need to glare so much. We’re here today to cooperate, after all.”

“Hm.”

Chester let out a low toned sigh.

He also knew well about the goal of today’s meeting.

‘If it wasn’t for that, there’s no reason for me to meet this disgusting bastard.’

Chester gritted his teeth.

Mills interlocked his fingers as he watched Chester.

“It seems Prince Simon raised a big achievement in the last monster expedition. Thanks to that, he became one step closer to being the Grand Duke of Grain compared to Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum who we follow.”

He put his chin on top of his interlocked fingers.

“That means we don’t have any room to step back. Also……’

Mills’ eyes shone with a nefarious light.

“You and I are the sons of Rinse Kingdom’s upper nobles’ houses and graduates of the famed Tron Academy, and we are people who are rising up and up in our own places. And if we were to fall behind a brat who was a mere country-bumpkin commoner until just now…… ah, isn’t it just dreadful to think about it?”

Chester didn’t react easily.

Unlike Mills, he wasn’t the type that was glib with his words.

“So what I’m saying is that let’s work together at least until we get to the Coat Barony.”

Chester opened his tightly shut mouth only then.

“And we’re acting on our own once we near the Coat Barony?”

“Of course.”

Mills lightly nodded his head.

Chester stared at Mills with calm eyes.

It wasn’t a bad proposal.

‘Honestly, I want to grab Roan Tale’s hand and throw out this bastard Mills, but……’

His pride didn’t permit that.

Although he had heard over and over about Roan’s skills from his father, Liss Kowan, and many other nobles until his ears bled, that didn’t mean he could recognize Roan as his rival.

‘Just where is this brat of lowly birth……’

To think he dared to think about standing shoulder to shoulder with them who were of prestigious upper nobility.

That at least couldn’t be tolerated.

‘That should be the same for the bastard Mills.’

Only because of that would he have extended his hand towards him while putting aside a slightly more advantageous position.

Chester nodded his head.

“Alright. Let’s do as you said.”

“As expected of Chester.”

Mills brightly smiled and opened his hands.

Tapping on the table with his finger, he continued to speak.

“Then let’s start setting up our plans.”

Chester nodded instead of answering.

And like that, the talk within the dark room continued on without an end.

The pitch-black space was full of only the two people’s voices.

No, although very quiet and unpleasant, there was another sound that no one paid attention to.

Squeak! Squeak squeak! Squeak!

*****

The marching ceremony was flashy.

There was no other way around it.

The march this time wasn’t for an expedition against monsters or a war against an enemy kingdom.

Rebellion.

The weight of that word was different.

To Roan, Mills, and Chester, Deni Von Rinse presented daggers inscribed with the king’s insignia.

That, as a symbol of King’s authority, represented the great order of suppressing the rebellion and vouched the right to do so.

It also meant that once Roan, Mills, and Chester marched off, not even the king, Deni III, could order or command them as he wished.

Vvuuuuu!

The horn echoed.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

And the grand sound of drums shook the earth and the sky.

Roan, Mills, and Chester rode on top of war horses and exited out of the castle’s gate while receiving the cheers of castle’s residents.

On the wide open field stood each legion.

Their numbers each reached ten thousand and totaled thirty thousand.

Since Elton’s fief army numbered three thousand, and at most ten thousand including forced conscripts and Baron Renard’s fief army that was absorbed later, it truly could be called an enormous army.

“Then, I pray for a successful fight.”

Mills slightly lowered his head while smiling brightly.

Chester glared once at Roan with a cold look and headed towards his own legion.

Roan made a bitter smile at the awkward and cold mood and gave a short salute.

“Let us meet in the Coat Barony.”

He spoke with a soft voice.

But no reply came back.

Vvuuuuu!

A moment later, Mills and Chester led their legion and began to march with the sound of the horn.

Although the two used two different roads, their directions were at least the same.

Instead of heading straight north, Mills and Chester chose the northwestern direction.

“It’s as we expected.”

Austin came close and whispered with a quiet voice.

Roan nodded his head as he watched the soldiers of the legion moving farther away.

“They probably thought that the nobles of the fiefs in the straight northward direction would obstruct them.”

The fiefs around the capital, Miller, and directly north were essentially Simon’s area of influence.

Especially ever since Simon had received the Aip Barony and the Posis Barony as rewards for the last monster expedition, his influence directly north of the capital became tighter and stronger.

Wary of nobles supporting Simon possibly holding them back or slowing down their marching speed, they decided to head in a northwestern direction where at least a bit of their influence touched.

‘That could be called a perfect judgment in a sense.’

In truth, Simon had set up a plan to slow down Mills and Chester’s marching speed with not too explicit methods if they entered his area of influence.

Roan smiled bitterly.

‘That should also be the same for Mills and Chester.’

If one were to argue, Roan’s side had a greater problem.

‘After all, south of the Coat Barony is all within Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum’s area of influence.’

The two princes’ support bases stood as if to protect the Coat Barony.

There was no way to circumvent them.

No, there was a way, but.

‘We’ll have to travel a great distance to go around them.’

It was a frustrating situation whichever way.

In truth, Simon and Tio also seriously pondered this situation.

But even so, Roan’s face was truly calm and relaxed.

He pulled his reins and stood in front of the legion’s soldiers.

It was a suppression force formed with the Amaranth troops at the core and parts of Simon and Tio’s troops.

“We directly march north!”

In any case, it was much faster than moving towards the northwest.

Roan sent a hand signal with his right hand.

Austin, who had been watching, shouted out loud.

“Tale Legion! March!”

He shouted with a strong voice.

At the same time, the sound of horns echoed.

Vvuuuuuu!

Their hearts jumped naturally.

The blood pumped and the faces blushed bright red.

Roan kicked the horse and went forwards as the legion’s lead.

Tale Legion.

The military flag inscribed with the suppression legion’s official name fluttered.

Roan Tale.

The suppression force’s commander and chief, Roan’s flag waved, and.

Amaranth Troop.

The core of the troops, the Amaranth troops’ flag rippled in the northern wind.

Going against the cool northern wind piercing through his armor, Roan whispered quietly.

“Let our path be accompanied by the light of glory.”

*****

“What? Is that true?”

“It’s true. It is information that the soldiers chasing Tale Legion’s back had checked numerous times over.”

Mills creased his brows at the adjutant’s report.

Tapping his chin with the tip of his finger, he fell into his thoughts.

‘He’s moving not directly north but towards the northeastern direction?’

He couldn’t understand it.

The northeastern direction was a direction that slowly moved further away from the Coat Barony.

‘Is it to avoid the mountainous region spread south of the Coat Barony?’

But Mills soon shook his head.

Although the mountainous region spreads following the fief’s southern border, it wasn’t precipitous enough to be unclimbable.

‘Is it to avoid our sides’ forces that are encamped there as expected?’

It was the most likely theory.

But even that had questionable points.

‘Even if it was for that, they turned towards east too early on.’

Marching directly north as far north as they could then turning east was a more advantageous path than the one now.

‘Does he perhaps have some other scheme?’

If it was Roan’s skill and actions he had heard about until now, there was no way he would do something that would end in a loss without a reason.

Mills once again sealed the letter the adjutant had handed him.

“Take this to the capital.”

He planned to leave the work of finding Roan’s inconceivable reason for his march to the other nobles left in the capital.

‘I will march towards the Coat Barony as quickly as possible.’

He was well aware of what he had to focus on.

The adjutant cautiously received the letter and placed it within his chest pocket.

“I will make sure to definitely pass it on.”

He slightly bowed his head and walked back.

The adjutant soon disappeared from his sight.

‘Roan Tale……’

Mills slightly raised his head and looked up at the sky.

“Huu.”

A short sigh leaked out.

For some reason, his chest felt stifling.

When Mills was looking up at the sky, there was another man who was looking down at the ground for the same reason at the moment.

‘The northeastern direction……’

His face was contorted as if he couldn’t understand.

He was Chester, who had just now heard about the direction of Roan’s march from a soldier.

‘For now, I’ll leave that to the nobles left in the capital.’

Chester also decided to entrust inquiring about Roan’s strange march to the capital.

Like Mills, he planned to focus only on marching towards the Coat Barony as fast as he could.

As if by fate, Mills and Chester, who were a bit apart, murmured the same words.

“Roan Tale. There won’t be anything to do so far away from the Coat Barony.”

Would that really be so?

That was something only Roan would know of.

March (1) End.

“Did you hear?”

“What? Ah! You mean the news about Baron Tale’s march?”

“Yeah. That news.”

“There’s no one in the capital that hasn’t heard that news. I heard it a long time ago.”

“However you look at it, it looks like Prince Simon made a big mistake this time.”

“I think so too.”

The voices noisily chattered.

In the glamorous grand hall, tens of nobles were focusing on one rumor that had been fiercely heating up the capital, Miller, recently.

It was about Roan Tale’s incomprehensible march.

When they had first heard the news, they thought that the report was mistaken.

Roan’s march was simply that unbelievable and ridiculous.

At least, it looked like that when they saw it.

“Your highness.”

Tio Ruin made a worried expression at the sound of nobles’ chatter.

Simon shook his head with a calm look.

“It’s okay. There’s no need to worry.”

Tio exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. Even if we do trust Baron Tale, the direction of the march is simply too strange…… there must be some reason, isn’t there?”

Simon cheerily smiled at those words and grabbed Tio’s shoulder.

“The reason Baron Tale is marching towards an unfathomable place is……”

He put strength into his voice.

“Because the victory is there. I believe it so.”

However, it couldn’t be helped that he felt a slight misgiving.

The tip of his eyes slightly trembled.

‘If it’s Baron Tale, he must have some sort of plan.’

He strained to throw away the doubts in his heart.

‘I can trust you, right? Baron Tale. No……’

Simon gritted his teeth.

‘I will trust you.’

The abilities Roan had shown him.

Simon decided to believe in those abilities.

At that moment, the grand chamberlain, Viscount Logan Dayle, showed himself.

With a large staff, he hit the marble floor three times.

“The sun of the kingdom and the deputy of the god Krea, His Majesty Deni III is coming. The loyal retainers of the kingdom, show your manners.”

Simon finally shook away the distracting thoughts only then.

‘The war isn’t only happening in the kingdom’s north. Here also……’

He lowered his head and deeply bowed towards Deni Von Rinse who walked into the grand hall.

‘This place is also a battlefield.’

Simon clenched his fist.

A peculiar energy stormed through the hall.

That was no doubt the spirit of war. 1

*****

Clop. Clop.

The sound of horseshoes clopping noisily echoed.

The Legion flag, raised up high, rippled in the northern wind.

Tale Legion.

The Legion that was tirelessly moving east was the Tale Legion, the one who plunged the capital Miller, Mills Voisa, and Chester Kowan into chaos.

“We can see Karon Village.”

The soldier of the advance party that had the scouting mission shouted out.

Roan, who had been leading the Legion at the head, faintly smiled.

‘It seems we have finally arrived.’

His gaze moved towards the village located far away.

No, to be exact, it was looking for a place beyond the village that couldn’t be seen.

‘They must all be confused.’

The smile that hung from his mouth became much deeper.

A march that led them further and further away from Elton Coat’s Barony.

It was completely incomprehensible from others’ point of view.

That was also the same for the soldiers of the Tale Legion.

“Why did we come here?”

“This place is a lot far away from the Coat Barony.”

“Did he perhaps chose the wrong path?”

Soldiers who were temporarily recruited from the Regate Troop and the Ruin Troop whispered.

“It’s Sir Baron Tale’s decision. We just need to follow the order.”

“He is absolutely not someone who would give out meaningless orders.”

Because at least the soldiers of the Amaranth troops put down the agitated atmosphere, there was no particular trouble.

“We turn right instead of entering the village.”

As soon as Roan’s order came down, the direction of the march immediately turned in a strange manner.

The Tale Legion left Karon Village to their right and headed south. 2

After an unknown amount of time, the wide open field suddenly ended and a clear blue river appeared.

“We can see the Teluo River.”

The scout shouted.

Roan didn’t hurry but slowly led the horse and arrived at the edge of the river.

“In the end, we actually came here.”

Austin murmured with a tense look.

Roan slowly nodded his head and looked at the Teluo River.

‘Teluo River……’

Originating north of the Pedian Plain, it was a river that flew into Poskein Lake.

It was the largest source of water in the Rinse Kingdom’s north and its size was fairly large.

It was one of the three biggest rivers in the kingdom.

But in reality, there weren’t any good uses for it.

It was only used for watering numerous fields and small scale fishing industries for the big and small riverside villages.

‘It’s all because of Poskein Lake.’

Regardless of their origin, Rinse Kingdom’s rivers all fed into Poskein Lake.’

In short, it was a situation where one end was completely blocked.

Consequently, water traffic didn’t develop despite there being plenty of influx of the water.

‘It’s a regrettable thing.’

Roan made a bitter smile.

Originally, he should have conquered the monsters of Poskein Lake and built a military port on Exos Island.

‘The stay at the capital became longer than I had expected.’

On top of that, he was in a situation where he had to suppress Elton’s rebellion.

‘Once this is over, cleaning up Poskein Lake comes first.’

It couldn’t be delayed any longer.

There was a need to at least put down the northern area of the lake.

‘Anyway……’

Roan’s gaze turned towards the Teluo River.

‘There’s nothing.’

This was something unexpected.

At that moment.

“My lord. I don’t see anything.”

He heard Austin’s voice.

“The thing couldn’t possibly have gone wrong, could it?”

His expression looked slightly worried.

In truth, Austin had been endlessly worrying all throughout the march.

The plan this time was just that ridiculous of a plan.

At that moment, a confident voice spoke up from the back.

“Please don’t worry too much. There’s no way the thing could’ve went wrong.”

The one who approached while softly smiling was Clay.

His face was truly calm.

‘Clay……’

Roan’s gaze moved towards Clay.

‘He is a much more brilliant genius than I had thought.’

The first position he had trusted Clay with was administrator of the Amaranth troop’s supplies.

From one point of view, it may have been a lowly position compared to the abilities he had shown.

But contrary to his expectation, Clay had sincerely carried out his job.

And in merely a month, he had completely changed the organization of Amaranth troop’s rations, supplies, weapons, and equipments.

Not only did he turn all the quantity management into documents and safeguarded them, he meticulously examined the rations and equipments, which were previously distributed in an approximate manner, obtained and redistributed them.

Due to that, there were no more cases of carelessly using up supplies, weapons, and equipment, and the ration distribution also became several times more efficient.

Even the few soldiers who looked with doubtful eyes at Clay also had to at least acknowledge his ability.

The problem was.

‘In the process of carrying out the work, a part of him was too excessively individualistic.’

He was overly confident of his abilities.

Because of that, he often silenced the opinions and advice of people around him and pushed through works based on his own judgments and decisions.

Of course, Clay’s judgments and decisions were correct most of the times and led to much better results.

But regardless of that, the complaints and dissatisfaction of those around him continued to rise every day.

Even if one worked efficiently, it was possible to be cursed at by others.

‘He is someone who could be a great strength if led well.’

Roan inhaled deeply.

A genius of Clay’s level wasn’t someone that could be easily obtained.

‘The plan this time was also something I couldn’t even think of.’

In truth, Roan was seriously contemplating before the marching ceremony for the rebellion suppression force.

‘There is no chance of victory by directly heading north.’

Putting aside the mountainous region that spread south of the Coat Barony, the nobles who sat below that and followed the Second Prince Tommy Rinse and Third Prince Kallum Rinse were a problem.

‘Furthermore, Mills and Chester have grabbed each other’s hand.’

It was the truth found thanks to the druidic ability of Clay.

If Mills and Chester had cooperated and schemed together, there was a high possibility that only Roan’s march would be slowed down.

‘I needed a solution.’

At that moment, Clay had proposed an unconventional plan.

‘Go up against the Teluo River using boats……’

It was a completely unexpected plan.

He was in fact building a navy at Nuperu Village located at Poskein Lake.

Because he actually had done so, he was planning to subjugate the monsters of Poskein Lake.

But he hadn’t even dreamt of using that navy in this rebellion-suppression plan.

‘My thoughts were unconsciously stuck on fixed ideas.’

Rinse Kingdom’s rivers couldn’t act as a waterway.

He was unconsciously stuck in that thought.

‘But Clay has presented the most ideal plan based on the situation without any stereotyped thoughts or preconceived notions.’

What was more astonishing was.

‘Even though it had merely been a month since he joined, he knew I was developing a navy and completely grasped just how far the development has advanced.’

It wasn’t something he knew of beforehand either.

While carrying out his work as the supplies administrator, Clay had separately asked Keep and studied and memorized every piece of information about the Tale Barony.

Because of that, he was able to immediately present a plan when Roan had fallen into thought.

‘Is this what they call a hard working genius?’

Roan looked straight into Clay’s eyes.

Although he pretended to be composed, confidence radiated from the light in his eyes and his behavior.

At that moment.

“Is this really okay? Even though there’s nothing on the riverbank?”

Austin asked with a stiff look.

Clay slowly nodded his head.

“They will soon arrive.”

His face was full of certainty.

‘There are no errors in my calculation. The ships will soon arrive. If things have gone wrong……’

He cringed the tip of his nose.

‘That’s all President Chris of Agens’ fault.’

The work this time was carried out with Clay and Chris’ strengths put together.

If the ships from Nuperu village didn’t arrive on time, that would be because Chris had made a mistake somewhere halfway in the work.

At least, that was what Clay had thought.

Austin let out a short sigh while looking at Clay’s confident look.

“If the thing has gone wrong, we would have made a big mistake in this rebellion-suppre……’

When he had spoke to that point.

“Here they come.”

He heard Roan’s voice.

“Yes?”

Austin asked back with a surprised look and turned his head following Roan’s gaze.

But all he could see was the Teluo River that calmly flowed by.

“Wh, where……?”

Austin extended his neck straight while his eyes turned round.

But there was still nothing that could be seen.

Then.

Vvuuuuu!

A sound of a horn quietly echoed out.

And at the same time, the prow of a ship suddenly appeared from the waterway that was hidden behind Karon Village.

“Ah!”

Austin let out a quiet exclamation.

It was also the same for the ten thousand soldiers who were lined up behind him.

“It, it’s a ship!”

“A ship has come!”

“And it’s not just one or two, but tens of them!”

Everyone shouted about with surprised faces.

On the other hand, Clay was making a truly confident smile as if to say ‘see’.

‘As expected, there’s no way I would be wrong. It seems President Chris also do a pretty good job.’

An arrogant thought filled his head.

Chwaaak!

With the sound of cutting through the water, tens of sailboats threw ropes towards the land.

Roan, who had been watching the situation, pulled his reins and looked towards the legion’s soldiers.

“Tale Legion! Begin preparing to board!”

He shouted aloud.

“We will take these ships and go up against the Teluo River!”

Immediately, the soldiers began to whisper.

“Is, is that something possible?”

“We’re moving by boats?”

Their thoughts had been solidly fixed just like most people.

Vvuuuuuu!

Once again the sound of the horn echoed out.

Strangely shaped ships tied their ropes to the land or landed and organized themselves.

Kkiiiig!

With a sound of wood being twisted, the tightly expanded sails folded at once and the anchors were submerged.

A familiar person’s shape emerged from the prow of a large and solid ship at the lead.

“My lord! Daiv of Amaranth troop Poskein Navy Branch greets you after a long while!”

The young man with a skeletal body.

He was the young sailor that Roan made a connection with when Roan was going to the Potter Fief. 3

Daiv, who at the time only had a single boat as his all, had endlessly endeavored for his dream of freely roaming the entire Poskein Lake, and the result of his efforts were the small and large ships that numbered in the tens.

Of course, it was thanks to Roan’s monetary support that he was able to remodel and build the ships. 4

“Daiv! Your fleet is magnificent!”

“It’s all thanks to my lord! Please board quickly!”

Daiv loudly laughed as he shouted.

Roan nodded his head then called Austin, Harrison, and Clay.

“Austin. From now on, we must move faster and more covertly. First……”

For a moment, he calmly explained the plans from then on.

The parts that weren’t clear or not explained were supplemented by Clay.

In the first place, the designer of the plan this time was Clay.

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Austin gave a short salute and answered once he heard it all.

Roan tapped Austin’s shoulder and turned towards the legion.

Paat!

Roan raised the Travias Spear towards the sky.

“Board!”

He gave out the order.

“Board!”

“Quickly board the ship!”

Then the hundred-men commanders and the ten-men commanders shouted and quickly moved.

The soldiers of the legion gracefully moved towards the ships like a stream.

That was, word for word, a grand sight that was never seen before.

Roan faintly smiled and looked towards the southwest.

A cloud flew by following a slope far far away.

Beyond that lied Elton Coat.

Vvuuuuu!

The sound of the horn once again hit his ears.

*****

“Yawn. I’m so tired I feel like dying.”

“Early morning guard duty is always so boring. Yawn.”

Two soldiers yawned and stretched on top of a castle wall.

On the night sky, the stars finely filled the space.

“But will we really be okay? I heard the capital has sent out a suppression force……”

The soldier with a sharp chin muttered with a worried look.

Then, the soldier with a short beard smirked and shook his hand.

“Don’t worry. Haven’t you heard? The Byron Kingdom will soon send us reinforcements.”

“That’s that, but what if the suppression force arrive first before the reinforcements?”

The sharp chinned soldier still looked worried.

The bearded soldier clicked his tongue while wearing a look that found him pathetic.

“Cht cht cht. Don’t worry about something so ridiculous. The suppression force has probably barely arrived at the southern border region. Since it’s a mountainous region there, their marching speed is slow, and most of all, our lord has personally went to face the……”

At that moment.

Sswaeeeek!

Out of nowhere, A sharp sound of impact echoed.

And at the same time, the guy who had been excitedly chattering on, shut his mouth.

His eyes were gaping open almost to the point of ripping apart.

Kung!

The guy who had been standing straight fell down without a twitch.

“Hck!”

With a surprised look, the sharp chinned soldier looked down at the bearded soldier.

“A, arrow?!”

His eyes widely opened as if he couldn’t believe it.

On the back of the man who fell, a single arrow was stuck there.

The sharp chinned soldier quickly turned his head and looked outside the castle wall.

His eyes quickly moved as if to search for the direction that the arrow flew from.

Then.

Sswaeeeek!

A sharp noise of impact hit his ears.

Pck!

An arrow stabbed itself into the sharp chinned soldier’s face.

“Kkeueug.”

The soldier fell forward just like that and fell down out of the castle.

Kuung!

A blunt sound rang out.

And simultaneously.

Sswaeeeeek!

A mind-blowing number of flaming arrows flew out and crossed the night sky.

Ppububububuk!

The burning arrows lodged themselves into not only the castle’s wall and the gate, but also the watch tower and the buildings inside the castle.

The fire spread instantly.

Pushing back the pitch-black darkness, the flames surged.

“As expected, it seems it simply hasn’t been fortified.”

The owner of the composed voice was Clay.

On the open field that spread outside the castle.

Roan and the Tale Legion were there.

“Harrison, that was a brilliant shot.”

Roan praised Harrison, who had put down the two sentries with merely two shots of arrows, and raised his spear up high.

“Elton Coat’s castle is right in front of our noses!”

A strength was carried on his voice.

“Break through the gate and enter the castle!”

“Yes sir!”

The soldiers answered in one voice.

Roan grabbed his reins.

“Attack!”

The order came out.

Vvuuuuu!

At the same time, the sound of the horn broke the silence of the plain.

“Waaaaa!”

“Attack!”

“Break down the castle’s gate!”

“Climb the castle’s wall!”

The roar of the soldiers soon followed.

Roan stood at the very front and led the soldiers.

The Travias Spear took the light of the fires and flashed with a red light.

March 2 End.

Yes, the raw said right. From what I can understand, the Legion went past the left side of the village, then turned north so that the village remained on their right. Like turning a corner and going right, except the village is the corner in this case. ↩

“Potter territory” was previously translated as “territory, but the more exact term is “fief”, which we will be using. ↩

Chapter 129




Tl/n (CSV): Regular Chapter for Thursday. The sponsored chapter (ch. 130) is a bit longer than we expected, so it’ll be up around noon or so tomorrow. Sorry.

“It’s as we expected. They are breaking through the southern border.”

“What idiotic fools. Kuk.”

Elton Coat made a foul smile.

Currently, he was in an army tent holding a strategy meeting.

HIs finger pointed at the map, no at the shoddy scribbles that couldn’t be called a map.

“To think they would try to cross the Southcoat Mountains without any preparations. Even if they are looking down on us, they’re underestimating us way too much.”

The adjutants all snickered that those words.

“Hmph! Things in the capital are all full of arrogance.”

“The Southcoat Mountains’ topography isn’t so good to move a large scale army even if the mountains aren’t too rough, but to try to force their way through…… Mills and Chester must be stupider than what the rumors say.”

“Since we have already set up wooden fences, watchtowers, and camps on the mountain paths and even sent not a small number of soldiers to ambush them, not even the capital’s grand army would be able to easily cross the mountains.”

Their faces were all self-assured.

‘It’s working!’

‘We can win this!’

The adjutants and vice-captains from a commoner background without nobility or last names trembled from an electrifying ecstasy.

They had been promised to be granted baronet titles if they destroy the suppression force and surrender to the Byron Kingdom with the Coat Barony and the Renard Barony.

‘Our lives will change!’

From a life of watching nobles and rich merchants’ moods, it would change to a glamorous life of flaunting around themselves.

‘Kuk. What simpletons.’

Elton inwardly sneered as he watched his subordinates’ faces.

‘Life doesn’t change that easily.’

Even if they surrendered to the Byron Kingdom, there was no way mere vice-captains and adjutants of commoner backgrounds would be promoted to baronets.

No, in the first place, Elton didn’t want that.

‘If I look after all of you one by one, my own shares will decrease.’

He had been promised the title of viscount and a large fief from the Byron Kingdom.

Not only that, the position of Byron Kingdom’s Southern Army’s general was secretly reserved for him.

‘I just need to hold on until the reinforcements arrive from the Byron Kingdom. I just need to hold the suppression force bastards coming up from the south for ten days. Then, I will become Byron Kingdom’s viscount and Southern Army’s general.’

Delightful thoughts spread out within his head.

“Anyhow, that Roan Tale, where’s that monster-like bastard?”

“Yeah. The only ones going through the mountains are Mills Voisa and Chester Kowan.”

“You idiots. Whose territory is the southern part of the mountains?”

“Ah! So the nobles following the Second Prince and the Third Prince are holding onto his legs?”

“Exactly! Can’t you see something so obvious? Kukuku.”

“To hold a political fight even during rebellion suppression. This country is rotten to the core.”

The vice-captains and the adjutants all laughed with each other and chatted.

It truly was a happy and peaceful time.

But sadly, that time didn’t last very long.

“My lord!”

The tent’s entrance suddenly opened up and a soldier appeared.

His look was horribly urgent and troubled.

“What is it?”

Sensing an ominous mood, Elton cautiously asked.

The soldier gulped and answered with a grave look.

“The southern defensive line has been penetrated.”

“What?!”

Elton widely opened his eyes.

That was also the same for the adjutants and vice-captains inside the tent.

“What? The southern defensive line was penetrated?”

“You mean the defensive line on the Southcoat Mountains?”

Similar questions rained down like a sudden shower.

The soldier nodded with a frustrated face.

“Yes! It has been completely penetrated! The legions led by Mills Voisa and Chester Kowan are climbing over the mountains and are running towards here!”

Bang!

A boom suddenly exploded.

Unable to hold himself back, Elton had slammed down on the table.

“The Southcoat Mountains’ defensive line is something we put our hearts and souls in to set up! But how could it not even last five days and get pierced! That’s ridiculous!”

The vice-captains and the adjutants, who had been being noisy, all twitched and shut their mouths.

For a moment, they watched Elton’s mood then shouted as if angry.

“They must have used some dirty trick!”

“Yeah. Without doing that, there’s no way that tight defensive line would have fallen so easily.”

Several adjutants echoed his words and nodded.

The soldier who made the report glanced at the mood for a moment, then answered in a tiny voice.

“Th, that isn’t it. According to the messenger, it was a perfect frontal attack. They, Voisa Legion and the Kowan Legion, attacked the defensive line straight on from the front and instantly annihilated it.”

Doom.

Immediately, a heavy silence fell over the tent.

Gulp.

Elton, as well as numerous adjutants, gulped.

Looks of doubt and shock appeared on their faces.

‘I, I don’t believe it. I heard that the capital’s elite soldiers are strong, but to break through the defensive line on top of a slope in just five days, are they seriously that strong?’

‘They are strong enough to annihilate a defense troop that had already fortified themselves?’

The uncomfortable silence continued on for a while.

The one who broke the silence was Elton’s right hand man, Tony.

“And their losses?”

Everyone’s gazes focused on the soldier.

The soldier weakly muttered with a mournful light in his face.

“It’s two thousand total between the two legions.”

“Two thousand?! Are you telling me the total casualties with both the Voisa Legion and the Kowan Legion combined are only two thousands?!”

One vice captain shouted thunderously.

The number of soldiers Elton placed on the Southcoat Mountains defensive line was five thousand.

Considering the geographical disadvantage and the theoretical relation between defender and attacker, Voisa Legion and Kowan Legion’s losses should have at least reached ten thousand.

With an aghast look, Tony shook his head.

“Are they that strong? The strength of those guys called the capital’s elite soldiers……?”

He became half out of his mind.

But even so, they couldn’t let time pass by just like that.

Even at that moment, Mills and Chester’s grand army was likely marching towards them.

“My lord. We must retreat for now!”

The place where they currently set up camp was the field that spread out on the Southcoat Mountains’ northern region.

It was the perfect place for a large scale battle.

‘They are the bastards who overwhelmingly won in that disadvantageous battle in the mountains. If we meet them directly on a field like this, it’ll be a complete defeat. For now, we must return to Tradi Castle where our lord’s castle is located.’ 1

If they close and lock the gate then wait out, the Byron Kingdom’s reinforcements would come.

“Holding a defensive battle at Tradi Castle should be good, sir.”

“As expected, is that the only way?”

Elton gritted his teeth with a ghostly white complexion.

‘Damn it! Monster like bastards!’

He thought that his ability too wasn’t that bad, but each and every one of them he fought against had monsterish abilities.

‘Not only from Roan Tale, to think that I’ll have to be chased and have to run away from bratty bastards like Mills Voisa and Chester Kowan!’

His pride was hurt, but there wasn’t any other way.

He looked around at the vice-captains and the adjutants and gave the order to retreat.

“Organize our troops then we’ll retreat to Tradi Castle! Hurry! We cannot have our backs caught by those bastards!”

“Yes! Understood!”

The vice-captains and the adjutants quickly answered then ran out of the tent.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Soon, the sound of drums signalling retreat loudly echoed out.

Once the news that the suppression force had broke through the Southcoat Mountains spread, Elton’s soldiers hurriedly moved like rats whose tails were on fire.

The preparations to retreat finished almost in the blink of an eye.

“Retreat! We head towards Tradi Castle!”

Elton sat at the lead and kicked his horse.

The war horse vigorously sprinted on.

However, that energetic gallop couldn’t go very far before it had to stop.

Dududududu!

A single horse rider ran towards them while blowing up a fine dust.

A single soldier whose armor was completely covered in blood blocked Elton’s path of retreat.

“My lord!”

He spoke with a desperate voice.

The soldier got on the ground as if falling from the horse.

Kung.

As if both his body and soul were greatly tired out, he kneeled down on the ground and threw down his head.

“T, Tradi Castle has fallen to the suppression force’s hand!”

The sound mixed with his crying rode the wind and hit Elton’s ears.

Elton pulled his reins.

Hihihihing!

The war horse wildly cried and stopped its legs.

The horse was awfully loud, but Elton’s ears couldn’t hear any sound.

He flapped his mouth with a stupefied expression then painfully spoke.

“Wha, what do you mean?”

He couldn’t even continue to ask.

The shock was simply too big.

‘T, Tradi Castle has fallen? And to the suppression force?’

Finally, Tony, who was at the side, asked instead.

“What do you mean Tradi Castle has fallen to the suppression force’s hands? What are you saying! Just who do you mean captured the Tradi Castle!”

The voice mixed with rage and confusion hit his ears.

The soldier who had been breathing roughly raised his head straight up and shouted as loud as he could.

“It’s Roan Tale!”

The soldier finished those words then lost consciousness and fell.

But there was no one who stepped up to help him.

Everyone merely stood frozen like stone sculptures and blinked their eyes.

Their minds were too busy simply digesting down that horrifying name they just heard.

‘Ro, Roan Tale!’

Everyone, with pale faces, gulped.

The worst opponent was choking their necks before they even knew it.

*****

“Hahaha! Did Elton actually start a rebellion with only this much strength?”

Mills Voisa heartily laughed as he kicked his horse.

Dududududu!

Nine thousand strong legion followed behind him.

‘Hmph! Elton Coat. Even if they are looking down on us, they’re underestimating us way too much.’

He had probably judged that he could buy plenty enough time with the Southcoat Mountains defensive line.

But that was a complete miscalculation.

The countryside fief’s soldiers, especially a disorderly mob scrapped together from here and there, couldn’t possibly stop the capital’s elite soldiers.

Also.

‘From the Southcoat Mountains, Chester and I decided to move separately.’

It was a situation where he would lose the lead of fief’s suppression to Chester if he were to mistakenly get held back there.

That was also the same for Chester.

In the end, the two maniacally broke through the defensive line to not fall behind each other, and the Southcoat Mountains defensive line was annihilated within a mere five days due to that.

‘By now, Chester must also be running towards Tradi Castle.’

The goal was Elton.

Because of that, he hadn’t even looked at the nearby villages or small castles.

They simply annihilated those who sometimes attacked back mercilessly and pierced through.

Thanks to that, Voisa Legion’s marching speed made one imagine a flying tiger.

At that moment, Mills’ second in command and distant cousin, Mose Voisa, came close.

“Brother! However you look at it, isn’t this rather strange?”

He pointed towards the front with his finger.

“However much the strength of Coat Barony’s army has fallen, it’s difficult to understand how lax it is. A new defensive line or support should have appeared by now, but not only support, we cannot even find a single ant.”

“You’re right. It is excessively lax.”

Mills nodded his head.

‘Even if Elton had focused his entire force at Tradi Castle, it’s hard to understand why the entire fief’s region is so empty.’

But even so, he didn’t have the leisure to sit down and analyze the situation.

Because while he did that, Chester would busily march towards Tradi Castle.

“The second largest castle in the Coat Barony, Phillis Castle should show up after we march a bit more. Let’s gather information there.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Phillis, a castle located south of Tradi Castle, was an important point that controlled the Coat Barony’s southern region.

‘If we capture that, it’ll be no different than conquering the southern region.’

The suppression war was proceeding more easily than he thought.

Dududududu!

With Mills and Mose at the lead, the nine thousand strong army sprinted frenziedly.

They must capture Phillis Castle faster than Chester’s Kowan Legion and march towards Tradi Castle.

After running for an unknown amount of time.

They could see a castle standing high on a wide plain.

“It’s Phillis Castle!”

At the scout’s yell, Mills stopped his legion and let them form up.

The legion’s soldiers faced the castle’s wall and lined up in a long line.

At that moment.

“It, it’s Kowan Legion!”

From the east of their formation, Chester led his legion’s soldiers and showed himself.

It was literally an ice-thin difference.

Between Mills and Chester, it was hard to place one above the other even in their marching speed.

“We attack first!”

Mills urgently ordered.

In the first place, there was no possibility for Phillis Castle to hold out against a grand army numbering twenty thousand.

The first one to attack had the greater possibility of monopolizing the achievements.

“Attack!”

“Waaaaa!”

With a cheer, the Voisa Legion ran towards Phillis Castle.

“Damn it! We’re also attacking!”

Chester, who was watching, tightly gritted his teeth and gave out the order to attack.

There was no time to newly set up a formation.

If he fell behind, there was nothing to earn.

“Attack!”

“Attack!”

In the end, the Kowan Legion couldn’t even calm their breaths and kicked off the ground once again.

The Voisa Legion and Kowan Legion’s charge.

The attack of an eighteen thousand strong army was truly a grand sight.

And the Phillis Castle in front of that was in a crisis like a candle flame before the wind.

It was as if looking at a small sailboat on a stormy sea.

At that moment.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The sound of drums noisily echoed from Phillis Castle’s outer walls.

And at the same time.

Kkiiiig!

The tightly closed gate opened wide and a drawbridge came down.

“Eh?!”

“Un?”

At the sudden development, Mills and Chester felt bewildered.

They urgently stopped the legions’ charge and lined up on the other side of the moat.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The sound of the drums that was hitting their ears also calmed down.

From the fully opened gate, a young man wearing, not even leather armor, but casual clothes appeared.

A man with small eyes that couldn’t be tell whether it was open or closed.

He was, in fact, Clay.

Clay walked out with a composed expression and stood on top of the drawbridge.

“Sir Mills Voisa, Sir Chester Kowan. You have all worked hard to arrive here.”

With an extremely courteous and graceful pose, he lowered his head.

“Who are you?”

Chester creased his forehead and asked back.

Clay cheerily smiled and answered.

“I am called Clay who serves Sir Baron Tale.”

Boom!

Suddenly, Mills and Chester’s faces stiffly froze.

“Ba, Baron Tale?”

“Why is a man serving Baron Tale here……?’

The two creased their foreheads as if they were unable to comprehend.

Clay faintly smiled as he looked at them then soon widely opened his two arms.

Suddenly.

Paat!

Great flags arose on top of the castle’s walls.

Tale Legion.

That was definitely the legion flag of Roan.

“Wha, what is……’

When Mills and Chester stuttered with shocked faces, Clay spoke with a confident voice.

“Tradi Castle and Phillis Castle have been captured by us, the Tale Legion.”

*****

“By now, the Voisa Legion and the Kowan Legion should have arrived at Phillis Castle.”

“Yes. They must truly be confused.”

Roan and Harrison rode their horses side by side and chatted.

They were currently marching towards the Coat Barony’s eastern region.

Harrison looked at the two thousand soldiers behind them and smiled.

“That man named Clay, he seems more amazing the more I see him.”

“Certainly, he is a talented person.”

Roan calmly nodded his head.

Using the ships and instantly capturing Tradi Castle and its surroundings and the Phillis Castle and its surroundings were all due to Clay’s strategy.

Also, Clay had.

‘To perfectly predict Elton’s path of retreat.’

Thanks to him, Roan and Harrison were able to lead only the elite cavalry including the Amaranth troops and set off to chase Elton Coat without being late.

“But is it really fine to be so relaxed?”

Harrison asked with a slightly worried expression.

Roan answered with a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Although Elton Coat is running away, his troops number three thousand. The Byron Kingdom’s reinforcement is also moving south. To completely annihilate them, we have to follow the original plan.”

“Yes. Certainly, there’s only that method.”

Harrison nodded his head and looked towards the front.

“Hundred-man Commander Austin will have to do well.”

Roan brightly smiled at those words and answered without even a bit of pause.

“He’ll do fine. Austin has never even once…”

The light in his eyes calmly went down.

“Disappointed me.”

He had complete trust in him.

Roan followed Harrison and looked up ahead.

Beyond the wide hill that spread out, a lush forest and a series of short and tall mountains rose sharply.

Most likely the battle was happening there as well.

The war was quickly bloating up its size like an avaricious monster.

Suppression (1) End.

Chapter 130




Tl/n (CSV): Sponsored chapter. Sorry about being late. The next chapter will be on Sunday night Pacific time.

Dududududu!

A fine dust blew up into the air along with the sound of horse hooves.

A group of horsemen sprinted towards east like an arrow.

The ones at the lead were Mills Voisa and Chester Kowan.

With stiff expressions, the two continually kicked their horses.

“Chester! Make sure to keep your promise!”

“You as well!”

Chester answered back shortly at Mills’ words.

Currently, the two have reluctantly allied themselves.

‘The main castle as well as most of the Coat Barony has already fallen into that Tale bastard’s hand.’

‘We have already fallen behind in this competition.’

Hating and competing against each other wasn’t any different than setting Roan’s victory in stone.

‘The one good news is that Elton didn’t return to Tradi Castle and has run towards the Byron Kingdom.’

‘That Tale bastard is also chasing Elton. We still have a chance.’

Mills and Chester picked out the entire cavalry and the elite soldier from the legions’ eighteen thousand soldier and went off on a chase.

Although Roan had started the chase first, it wasn’t too hopeless of a situation.

‘Elton’s camp was closer to us.’

‘The distance we have to catch up to is much shorter on our side.’

Mills and Chester once again kicked their horses.

Dududududu!

The sound of horseshoes loudly rang out as the five thousand strong cavalry sprinted rapidly.

Their goal was Elton.

No it was to place the princes they each served into the position of the Grand Duke of Grain.

*****

They sprinted for two days and nights.

In the first place, that was a enough time to have already reached the border if there was a definite destination.

But to catch Elton who may be hiding somewhere or perhaps running towards somewhere, Mills and Chester were moving while going through anywhere that had a high possibility of finding him.

And as they did so, all they had done was reach the Coat Barony’s northeastern countryside region despite two days passing since they began the chase.

“Keep up just a bit more!”

“The ringleader of the rebellion is definitely just up ahead.”

Mills and Chester encouraged the tired soldiers.

The knights who used mana techniques showed a slight sign of exhaustion, but there was no problem to their stamina.

The problem was the regular horsemen who were elites but didn’t know how to control mana.

They were slowly becoming exhausted from the forced march that continued on without a rest.

‘Damn it. Chasing anymore is impossi……’

A curse mixed with irritation got stuck in his throat.

His eyes became big and round.

On Mills and Chester’s faces, who had climbed over a small hill, a light of joy and ecstasy appeared.

It felt as if, in a single moment, the pressure and exhaustion that was crushing down on their entire body flew away.

“We caught him.”

Said Mills.

“Yeah. We finally caught his tail.”

Chester gave a short reply.

The two’s gazes were directed towards the lush forest that spread below the hill.

At the entrance of the forest that spread towards the rugged mountain far away, a group of people was taking a rest.

Their number was barely three thousand.

They were the Elton and the Coat Barony troop that Mills and Chester had so desperately chased.

‘The number on our side is five thousand strong. Although they may be exhausted, they’re made up of knights and elite soldiers.’

‘We can take on a mere three thousand countryside soldiers.’

Mills and Chester had similar thoughts.

In truth, it was hard to say who had the advantage just by looking at their numbers.

Although the ones who were following Elton at his sides were countryside fief soldiers, they were those who were categorized as elites among those soldiers.

If Mills and Chester thought of them as the same level as the rebellion forces they faced until now, they could easily get hurt.

‘I know very well that it’s not an opponent we can scoff at. But……’

Mills and Chester bit down on their lips.

The reason they couldn’t order the exhausted soldiers to rest and were considering an irrational attack.

‘Roan Tale will soon arrive.’

‘If we make a mistake, we could lose this perfect chance.’

They had to cut off Elton’s neck before Roan got there.

If they could do that, the biggest achievement would be Mills and Chester’s to take despite falling behind in the fief’s suppression.

“Should we sound the horn for the attack?”

One vice-captain came up and asked.

Mills squinted his eyes and shook his head.

“We approach as stealthily as possible. Once we close the distance, we will blow the horns and attack at the same ti……”

When he had spoken to that point.

Vvuuuuuu!

A horn sounded out of nowhere.

Mills and the vice-captain, who had been sharing sharp gazes, quickly turned their heads to search for the horn player.

At the gazes that suddenly pour down on him, the horn player shook his horn as if to say it wasn’t him who blew it.

At that moment, he heard Chester’s voice.

“Mills. Look other there.”

The voice was heavy and composed.

It was a voice completely devoid of the joy and ecstasy that had floated until now.

Mills quickly turned his head and looked below the hill.

It had changed.

Within the short moment, the scene below the hill had changed.

Mills’ face twisted harshly.

“Byron Kingdom troops……”

From the entrance of the lush forest, a group of soldiers that couldn’t be seen just a moment ago appeared.

The gang that held Byron Kingdom’s flag at the lead and blew their horns without a rest.

They were definitely the Byron Kingdom troops that had marched to save Elton.

‘Is it about four thousand?’

Mills and Chester looked at each other and creased their brows.

The numerical superiority instantly disappeared.

Seven thousand against five thousand.

And on top of that, Mills and Chester’s soldiers were greatly exhausted.

“For now, let’s set up a formation and let the soldiers rest.”

Mills decided to take one step back.

Chester pondered for a moment then nodded his head.

Although his personality was more impetuous than Mills’, he understood well that forcing an attack in this situation was suicidal.

Mills and Chester lined up at the foot of the hill.

The sight of the soldiers lining up by troops were awe-inspiring in its own way.

The Coat Barony troop realized Mills and Chester’s pursuit only then and busily moved.

But there was no sign of trying to fall back or retreat.

They had realized that the situation was more advantageous for them.

‘It looks like it’ll be a more difficult battle than I thought.’

Mills and Chester glared at the Coat Barony troop formation and exhaled a long sigh.

Then.

Vvuuuuuu!

A sonorous sound of the horn hit their ears.

This time, it wasn’t the sound of the horn that the Byron Kingdom troop was blowing.

The sound was coming from behind and beyond the hill.

“What the?”

“Could it be?”

Mills and Chester creased their foreheads and looked behind them.

As if it had been waiting, a single troop flag shot out on top of the hill.

Amaranth Troop.

“Ah……”

“So they ultimately came……”

Mills and Chester let out a mute exclamation.

Leading the Amaranth troop, Roan had showed up.

Ultimately, their plan to cut off Elton’s neck before he arrived popped like a bubble.

Dududududu!

With a sound of horseshoes, two thousand cavalry soldiers ran down the hill.

‘Is it merely two thousand……’

Mills and Chester, who were momentarily dispirited, unconsciously formed strange smiles.

In the current situation, there was nothing that could be done with merely two thousand soldiers.

‘Meaning, we have to cooperate in the end.’

Ultimately, Roan wouldn’t be able to do anything but extend his hand towards them.

‘It’s seven thousand if we combine us three’s numbers. If it’s seven thousand versus seven thousand, it’s doable.’

Meanwhile, Roan had come down the hill and neared them.

“Sir Voisa, Sir Kowan.”

He slightly lowered his head towards Mills and Voisa.

“You’re a bit late. Sir Baron Tale.”

Mills lightly greeted him.

With a single sentence, he tried to decide the hierarchy of the achievements.

At those words, Roan faintly smiled and replied with a confident voice.

“Sir Voisa and Sir Kowan were too slow, so I’ve taken a look around the entire Coat Barony.”

“Hhm……”

Immediately, Mills and Chester’s faces froze stiffly.

Since Roan had taken the lead in the fief’s suppression, they had nothing else to say.

Roan glanced at Elton and the Byron Kingdom troops’ numbers.

‘He did it.’

A strange light flashed in his eyes.

But he soon hid his expression and turned towards Mills and Chester.

“Why are sirs merely standing still when Elton is right before your eyes?”

With expressions that seemed to say can’t you tell even when you see it?, Mills and Chester answered.

“The Byron Kingdom troops have came.”

Roan slowly nodded at those words.

“I see.”

His expression and voice were awfully calm.

He raised his right hand and gave a hand signal.

The two thousand riders quickly took formation and lined up.

It was a perfect charging formation.

“Wha, what are you doing?”

Mills and Chester asked back with shocked faces.

Roan pulled his reins and replied with a resounding voice as he stood at the formation’s head.

“I will go and bring back Elton’s head.”

“What?! Are you saying you’ll face seven thousand enemy soldiers with merely two thousand soldiers?”

Mills squinted his eyes and shouted.

Instead of answering, Roan faintly smiled and took out the Travias Spear.

Chang!

The spear’s handle extended when he inserted mana.

Roan raised the spear up high and kicked his horse.

“Attack!”

The order fell down and the sound of the horn soon followed.

Dududududu!

The two thousand cavalry charged with the sound of horseshoes towards Elton and the Byron Kingdom troops.

“Eh?! Eh!”

“Damn, that insane!”

Mills and Chester shouted at Roan’s independent and reckless attack.

“We have to stop him immediately!”

Chester’s face especially burned red as if it would explode.

But Mills, who had been quietly analysing the situation, calmed his breathing and made a strange expression.

“Roan Tale’s troop is originally famous for being strong.”

“What are you saying all of a sudden?”

Chester creased his brows.

Mills continued to talk.

“If it’s Roan Tale’s troops, they should be able to deal a big loss to the enemy even though they can’t win.”

“Ah……’

Chester let out a quiet exclamation.

It was impossible for Roan alone to break Elton and the Byron Kingdom troops.

‘The Amaranth troop will be annihilated and Elton and the Byron Kingdom troop will also receive quite a big damage.’

After that, they would step up, cut off Elton’s neck, and suppress the rebellion forces.

It was the best situation for Mills and Chester.

And furthermore, they could have the soldiers recover their stamina while the Amaranth troop rioted.

In many ways, Roan’s reckless attack was something very favorable to them.

However.

“Would the merit raised from such action be honorable?”

Chester asked.

Mills made a bitter smile.

“Let’s not think up to that point.”

He let out a short sigh.

“Huu. If we think about even something like that, there isn’t anything we can do.”

Chester quietly whispered at those words.

“Right. We’ve already been as cowardly as we could be.”

Already, there was the time when they cooperated to slow down Roan’s marching speed.

But the thing they were trying to do now was something on a completely different scale.

Mills and Chester, with stiff and solid expressions, chased Roan’s back with their eyes.

Vvuuuuu!

The sound of horn, which made their hearts jump until a moment ago, felt irksome.

‘Don’t be embarrassed. It’s a choice for the future.’

Mills and Chester held down their shaking feelings.

However it was, they had grabbed a brand new chance to turn things around.

Of course, only the two of them thought that.

*****

“What the?”

He spoke with a dumbfound voice and expression.

Elton looked at the troop charging towards them along with the dust clouds and leaked out a light laugh.

“Whose troop is it?”

The sudden question’s answer came immediately.

“It’s the Amaranth troop. It’s Roan’ Tale’s troop.”

“Roan Tale!”

Elton gritted his teeth and glaringly opened his eyes.

Then he soon snorted and shook his head.

“He must have lost his mind after raising merits several times. To attack with only that many soldiers.”

“Yes. Even though we already have met with the Byron Kingdom troops……”

Tony echoed back and snickered.

As soon as his words finished, the sound of horn and drums echoed immediately as if it had been waiting.

Vvuuuuu! Boom! Boom! Boom!

It was the sound of Byron Kingdom troops, which were standing on the left and right of the Coat Barony troop, preparing to intercept.

Elton look at that sight and ordered with a voice full of confidence.

“We’re also intercepting! This time, let’s finally cut off that disgusting and horrible Roan Tale’s neck!”

“Yes! Understood!”

The vice-captains and the adjutants answered and moved quickly.

Elton stood at the lead and glared at Roan and his troops sprinting straight at him.

‘The battle this time is your loss!’

He pulled his reins and kicked his horse.

Hihihihing!

The horse loudly cried then soon kicked off the ground.

Dudududu!

With Elton and Tony at the lead, the three thousand Coat Barony troop began to charge against Roan’s troops.

Vvuuu!

Then, the four thousand Byron Kingdom troop went out to intercept.

The thing they were targeting was the merely two thousand strong Amaranth troop.

Seven thousand against two thousand.

It was a truly difficult and impossible fight for Roan.

Everyone thought so.

Elton, Mills, and Chester.

But Roan at least was making a faint smile.

‘We did it.’

Everything flowed as he wished.

As he kicked the horse several times, the wind of the battlefield blew over his armor.

Soon, the soldiers of the Coat Barony troop were in front of his nose.

Roan raised his spear up high.

Simultaneously.

Kboom!

Roan’s troops and Elton’s troops violently collided.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Spears and spears, swords and swords clashed and metallic sounds exploded out.

Sparks flew and streams of bloods ruptured.

“Uwaak!”

“Kuc!”

Death throes and screams.

The hushed battlefield soon regained its noise.

Roan’s spearmanship was blinding.

It wasn’t that it was blindingly skillful, but it literally was blinding.

Following the spear’s path that endlessly flowed like water, a light flashed.

Each time the Travias Spear’s handle and blade moved, a flower of blood blossomed without exception.

Sssekk! Sssukk!

“Kueek!

“Kek!”

The Coat Barony troop’s soldiers lost their necks and fell.

It was an overwhelming might.

Using the last tens of wars and battles and hundreds of days of training, Roan had developed his mana technique and spearmanship by more than several levels.

In the movement that used to be only rough and powerful, a hint of leisure could be felt.

The mana that circled his body also repeatedly flowed and stopped according to Roan’s will.

Sssskk!

The war horses and soldiers were completely cut apart with a horrifying sound.

“Uuuu. It, it’s a monster!”

“No way!”

The common soldiers were filled with fear at Roan’s might.

But despite Roan’s such feat, the overall progress of the battle was extremely disadvantageous.

It wasn’t easy to overcome a numerical disadvantage in a battle started with a frontal attack instead of a trick.

“Uhahaha! Roan! Serves you right! The day I finally break your high nose has come!”

Elton let out a crazed laugh at his advantageous situation.

Of course, he didn’t forget to stay in the back where Roan’s spear didn’t reach all the while.

The Coat Barony troop’s soldiers who were intimidated by Roan’s might once again raised their spirits.

“Yeah! There’s no need to fear!”

“They’re only two thousand!”

“We also have reinforcements!”

The vigor that went up once was like a tidal wave.

It was a helpless and perilous moment for Roan and the Amaranth troop.

But despite that, the face of Roan, no the faces of the Amaranth troop’s soldiers were strangely relaxed.

That disturbed Elton’s temper.

“Roan! What’s with that damned and disgusting leisure! You’re now cornered!”

He felt needlessly restless.

‘He can’t possibly have another card up his sleeve, could he?’

Roan cut down another enemy soldier and calmly answered.

“Who knows if reinforcements will suddenly appear.”

“Reinforcements?”

Elton creased his forehead as asked back, then snorted.

“Hmph! Why don’t you look behind you! Even the ones who came first are just standing still like that, so what reinforcements! Unless a miracle happens, no reinforcements will appear!”

He jeered acidly.

Roan looked back at those words.

Thanks to Kalian’s Tears, he could clearly see Mills and Chester as if they were in front of his nose.

‘Even so, it seems they’re feeling self-conscious.”

Mills and Chester’s faces were stiff.

Probably, they were conflicted between pride and conscience.

“Roan! Your neck will be cut off here today!”

Elton raised his sword up high.

“Attack! Everyone attack! Kill them all!”

At the order that followed, the Coat Barony troop’s soldiers pushed the Amaranth troop back even more fiercely.

It was a situation where they were helplessly pushed back.

And at that very moment.

“Sound the horn!”

Roan gave the order.

Vvuu! Vvuu! Vvuu!

The horn’s sound echoed strangely unlike before.

At the same time, Roan looked at Elton and made a deep smile.

“Elton.”

His voice was cold.

“The reinforcements have finally arrived.”

“Re, reinforcements?!”

Elton as well as the Barony troop’s soldiers nearby all looked around with ghostly pale faces.

But there were no signs of reinforcements anywhere.

Elton soon gave out a crazed laugh.

“Hahahaha! You must finally have lost your mind! What reinforcements! Just where are your reinforcements!”

Immediately after he finished those words, the Byron Kingdom troops that were formationed at the left and right blew their horns.

Vvuu! Vvuu! Vvuu!

It was the exact same sound that the Amaranth troop had blew just a moment before.

Elton’s face instantly turned stiff.

At that moment, a booming cheer exploded out from all directions.

“Just where are we? Right over here!”

The owners of the cheer.

Shockingly, they were the Byron Kingdom troops.

“Wha, just what……?!”

Elton was so shocked that his jaw dropped.

That was also the same for the Coat Barony troop’s soldiers.

Seeing the Byron Kingdom troop suddenly point their swords towards them, they were dumbfounded.

At that moment, the Byron Kingdom’s flag that had been soaring up high fell down to the ground and a new flag arose.

Tale Legion.

“Ah……”

Elton let out a tiny exclamation.

Roan cheerily smiled as he watched that sight.

“Elton. It seems a miracle has happened just like your words.”

Just like that, the wind of the battle completely changed.

Chapter 131




Tl/n (CSV): IatM ch. 132 for May 23 will be delayed to tomorrow. Sorry. I’m just not feeling to well today.

Karon Village, a few days ago.

“Austin, from now on we must move faster and more covertly. First, take five thousand soldiers from the Tale Legion and march north towards the national border.”

“Yes, understood.”

Austin quickly replied.

It was plot that he already heard before leaving the capital, Miller Castle, and had memorized

At that moment, a young man with a familiar face approached from Daiv’s fleet.

“My lord, greetings after a long time.”

“Pens, good job coming all the way here.”

“No, it wasn’t much.”

The young man was the vice president of Agens and Chris’ right hand man, Pens.

From his chest pocket, he took out a bundle of papers.

“These are the information on the Byron Kingdom troops’ size, routes, and its commanders.”

Roan briefly glanced through it then directly handed it to Austin.

“This is the intelligence that Agens has meticulously searched for and investigated. It’s crucial information for the ambush.”

“President Chris is amazing. It was only a few days ago that we requested them, but to think he would complete the preparations so perfectly.”

Austin showed a surprised expression as he looked through the report.

Pens faintly smiled and shook his head.

“It’s information we already knew beforehand. Thanks to that, we were able to quickly organize them and make the report when the request came in.”

“That’s amazing in its own way.”

Austin marvelled once again.

At that moment, Clay, who had been quiet, interrupted.

“After destroying the Byron Kingdom troops, please change into their armor and head towards the eastern region of the Coat Barony.”

A detailed explanation of the strategy continued for a while.

The designer of this strategy was Clay.

“Is this really a feasible strategy?”

Austin asked with a slightly nervous expression.

With a confident face, Clay nodded his head.

“Yes, it’s feasible.”

There wasn’t a hint of hesitation.

“Can we really meet up with Elton if we go to Wines Forest in the eastern region?”

“Yes. We will be driving him into Wines Forest’s entrance.”

Clay once again answered with a confident face.

Ultimately, Austin nodded his head and didn’t raise any more questions.

“Austin, your role is the most important one in this strategy.”

Roan looked straight into Austin’s eyes.

“I trust you. Make sure you succeed.”

“Yes, understood.”

Austin gave a short salute and bowed.

At that reliable figure, Roan tapped Austin’s shoulder.

This was Roan and the Amaranth troop’s secret strategy meeting before leaving the Karon Village.

‘Austin answered my expectations.’

Roan cut off the head of a panicking Coat Barony troop soldier and gazed towards the left wing.

“Corner them! They are the core of the rebels! Behead them all!”

The man that unstoppably roamed the battlefield as he gave orders.

That man was Austin.

“We aren’t the Byron Kingdom troops!”

“We are the Tale Legion!”

“We are the Amaranth troop!”

Cheers exploded out from all directions.

Elton and the Coat Barony troop were helplessly surrounded.

“Uaaah! Damn! Damn it all!”

Elton raged.

No, he became wrapped in madness.

‘Again! Again! I’ve been done in by that bastard again!’

He couldn’t take the truth that he was once again tricked by Roan.

“Roan! Kill Roan! Forget about the others!”

Elton shouted with a bright red face.

But the Barony troop’s soldiers couldn’t carelessly move.

They were terrified by Roan’s seemingly possessed spearmanship

“Damn, stupid bastards!”

In the end, Elton raised up his sword high and went up to the frontlines

‘If I can do something about that Roan bastard, I could bring back the chance for victory.’

The one final move to turn the unfavorable situation around.

That was to hit the head rather than the body or the tail.

He planned to personally face the Tale Legion’s commander, Roan.

From a certain point of view, it was a rational and efficient decision but.

‘You picked the wrong opponent.’

‘To dare to try and fight our lord.’

‘It’s impossible with only that much skill.’

The Amaranth troop as well as Tale Legion’s soldiers snorted as they looked at Elton.

To them, Elton was like a moth.

Like a moth that jumps into fire without knowing that it’s body is burning to cinders.

“Die! Roan!”

Elton shouted as loud as he could and swung his sword.

Befitting of a warrior-noble of the kingdom, he had also learned a mana technique.

Psss.

The mana flowed through the sword’s edge.

Swnng!

The sound of the impact exploded.

It truly was a fast attack.

But the opponent was bad.

Chang!

Roan shook the Travias Spear left and right and lightly blocked his attack.

“It’s fast, but it’s an extremely light sword.”

With a sharp evaluation, the spearhead moved once again.

Spat!

When he twisted and moved his two wrists, the spear’s handle shook in every direction.

The black spearhead slashed the wind and danced.

“Huhuk!”

At the attacks that rained down from head to waist without a single place to dodge, Elton gasped.

Chang! Chachang! Paat! Spaat!

Elton blocked some and dodged some, and barely kept his life.

‘For a brat who was a lowly commoner to use this high level mana technique!’

He couldn’t accept it.

The hand holding the sword clenched harder.

“Die!”

He once again gritted his teeth and pulled his reins.

Then.

Ssuug.

The Travias Spear’s length suddenly extended.

Instantly, the sharp end of the spear reached his chest.

“Damn!”

Elton quickly pulled his sword and parry the spear’s tip.

No, he tried to do that.

But.

Cheng! Zhzzuk!

The moment the spear’s tip touched the flat of the sword, the entire sword cracked with an unpleasant sound.

“N, no way……”

Elton looked at Roan with a dumbfounded look.

Roan faintly smiled as he shook his head.

“I won’t see you off for very far.”

Simultaneously, he twisted his wrist.

“N, no!”

Elton screamed but it was in vain.

Puuk!

The sword shattered into pieces and the Travias Spear pierced Elton’s chest.

“Kuuk!”

Elton eyes dilated completely as he cried out a death throe, and his whole body trembled.

And when the short trembling stopped, the head that had been stiffly raised up bent and fell down.

‘Elton, I contemplated much on whether to let you live or not.’

The reason was clear.

At the moment, the people of the world, even including the nobles and the royalty, thought that Elton had close relationship with the Second Prince Tommy Rinse.

But in reality, Elton was the Third Prince Kallum Rinse’s subordinate.

‘The reason Prince Kallum wanted to be the commander for the suppression force was probably to silence Elton with death using his own hands.’

He most likely wanted to erase his secret relationship with Elton for good.

If Elton was kept alive, Tommy and Kallum would have been pit against each other over the inquiry into the truth.

To Simon, there would have been no situation better than that.

While the two princes pointed their swords at each other, Simon could solidify his base even further

‘Because of that, I thought about whether I should keep him alive……’

But on the day he captured Tradi Castle, Roan had discovered the letters that Kallum and Elton had exchanged and the evidence of an illicit collusion from Elton’s castle.

‘Instead, this evidence is more effective in shaking and controlling the nation’s politics.’

Furthermore, he could use them to gain something even bigger.

From Simon as well as from Tommy and Kallum.

‘There no longer was any need to specifically keep Elton alive.’

Instead, keeping him alive would greatly lower the effective value of the other evidence.

‘I’ll cut off Elton’s neck.’

In the first place, King Deni Von Rinse’s order was also to cut off his head.

Roan pushed aside the various thoughts in his head and swung his spear.

Sssk!

Elton’s neck was slashed off clean.

Meanwhile, the Coat Barony troop was at the brink of annihilation.

“P, please don’t kill me!”

“I’ll reveal all of the lord’s secret if you let me live!”

“Please forgive me!”

Vice-captains and the adjutants as well as Elton’s closest soldiers begged for forgiveness.

But Roan and the Tale Legion’s swords and spears didn’t stop.

Although Roan was usually full of compassion, he wouldn’t leave behind any seeds of trouble on the battlefield.

“Uaak!”

“Kuuk!”

Screams rang out one after another.

And just like that, Elton and the rebel force’s leading members all lost their lives.

It was a complete victory.

The panic of the entire rebellion force and the destruction of their formation thanks to Clay’s strategy was the driving force behind the complete victory.

When Roan gave a hand signal, the flag bearer waved a small signal flag.

The Tale Legion quickly went into formation and lined up.

Their figures were without a single disorder or a single soldier out of place.

Roan stood in front of them and raised Elton’s head high into the air.

“We have cut off the traitor’s head and suppressed the rebellion!”

He shouted with a sonorous voice.

The faces of the Tale Legion’s soldiers flushed red.

Their hearts beat rapidly.

Roan looked over the faces of the troop’s soldiers and shouted at the top of his lungs.

“It’s our victory!”

The very moment he shouted those words.

“Waaaaa!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

Cheers exploded.

The soldiers genuinely rejoiced.

The feeling of accomplishment at completing the monumental mission of suppressing the rebellion, the feeling of relief at their survival, the sense of awe towards Roan……

Their cheers were mixed with numerous kinds of feelings.

Roan smiled as he watched that sight then pulled his reins.

He could see Mills and Chester standing far away at the foot of the hill.

Their faces were much more stiff than before.

Their expressions were more serious than the ones when they were conflicting between pride and conscience.

Mills and Chester.

At that moment, their evaluation of Roan began to change for the first time.

***

“Does this make sense to you?”

Mills asked with a stiff face.

Chester didn’t answer.

No, he couldn’t.

“Are you telling me that not only did they annihilate the Byron Kingdom troops, they disguised themselves as the troops and approached Elton?”

Mills asked again.

Only then did Chester speak with a heavy voice.

“Perhaps it may be that Elton had been unknowingly chased and led towards this Wines Forest.”

The kingdom’s two geniuses.

Mills and Chester watched Roan’s battle and correctly surmised the entire series of situations.

Gulp.

The two gulped nervously.

‘Is he really from a commoner vice-captain background?’

‘I thought the rumors had been exaggerated……’

They had fully heard and learnt of rumors, reports, and information about Roan.

But they couldn’t believe all those great achievements word for word as they were told.

It was because they simply weren’t a level of achievements that a young man in mere twenties, and especially a vice-captain from an ordinary commoner background could raise.

They simply thought that he was a guy who had merely caught Prince Simon’s eyes and was promoted by luck.

‘No. Our judgments were wrong.’

‘The guy is real. He’s several steps above us.’

Mills and Chester couldn’t do anything but recognize Roan’s abilities.

Going against the Teluo River on a fleet and capturing Tradi Castle.

No, in the first place, the very act of crafting and owning a fleet of that size was impressive.

And even separately annihilating the Byron Kingdom troops and perfectly suppressing the rebellion by leading Elton into a corner.

Everything was realized just like the picture Roan had drawn and as he had planned.

‘Roan Tale……’

‘It seems it won’t be a easy fight from now on.’

Mills and Chester deeply inhaled.

From afar, Roan and the Tale Legion approached.

Mills looked at Chester.

“We can’t end it like this, could we?”

“Right.”

Chester replied shortly and nodded.

Making peculiar expressions, they stared at Roan.

‘Hhm.’

Roan looked at Mills, Chester, and the five thousand elite soldiers lined up behind them and leaked a quiet sigh.

‘Do they perhaps plan to fight?’

The light in his eyes calmly dimmed down.

Mills, Chester, and the five thousand elite soldiers maintained formation and looked directly at Roan while lined up.

A strange vigor could be felt.

It wasn’t something like killing intent or pressure, but pure military discipline.

‘Each side’s numbers are more or less the same.’

Five thousand against five thousand.

But while Roan was fighting, Mills and Chester’s soldiers were resting.

‘It looks like it won’t be a easy fight if we fight.’

Roan gritted his teeth.

If the chance showed itself, he planned to attack first.

But at that moment, Mills rode his horse and went up towards him.

His expression was stiff.

A strange silence fell down.

Then.

“Hahahahahaha!”

Mills suddenly burst out laughing.

His stiff expression had also turned bright all of a sudden.

Even clapping his hand, he greatly rejoiced.

“Sir Baron Tale! You’re truly amazing! Hahaha!”

At the completely unexpected situation, Roan slightly creased his brows.

Mills stopped laughing and nodded.

“I, Mills Voisa, received quite a big lesson today! This rebellion suppression war is my complete defeat, a complete defeat. Hahaha!”

He acknowledged his defeat.

Roan, after only meeting nobles who were thoroughly clumped up in arrogance and selfishness, felt refreshed meeting someone like Mills.

‘Even so, they’re the geniuses representing the kingdom, is it?’

At that moment, Mills spoke with a slightly humorous expression.

“But please do remember that the ones who caught Elton’s tail was Chester and I.”

“Of course.”

Roan lightly nodded.

There was no need to go out of his way and reveal that that too was a part of his plan.

Mills gave a short salute.

“Hahaha.”

He heartily laughed and then turned his horse’s head around.

For a short moment, he met Chester’s eyes.

‘For now, admit defeat and step back.’

In this moment, pointing a blade at Roan was the worst of the worst possible moves.

‘Yeah, since this isn’t the end.’

Chester slightly nodded his head.

Mills showed a faint smile and then led his troops and disappeared over the hill.

Only then did Chester ride his horse towards Roan.

He didn’t say much unlike Mills.

“Sir Baron Tale.”

Chester rode up right next to Roan and extended his right hand.

Roan faintly smiled and shook that hand.

A burning warmth, no a heat, no his pride was conveyed.

Chester stared directly into Roan’s eyes.

“I definitely will not lose next time.”

He spoke with a brusque voice and expression.

Roan nodded his head.

“I look forward to it.”

The two’s hands lightly shook.

Chester then turned his horse around and led his troops over the hill.

Roan, who was left alone, gazed at the direction the two had disappeared to and deeply inhale.

‘Mills and Chester.’

He didn’t expect that the two would possibly react like this.

Of course, he couldn’t know whether their demeanors were true or false.

It was because Mills and Chester were also very famous people in the last life.

‘Mills betrayed Rinse Kingdom and defected to the Estia Empire, and Chester started a rebellion after losing a political power struggle and was killed.’

If their current attitudes were true, those events seemed impossible to occur.

‘Just what could have happened……’

Just what broke Mills and Chester?

Or just what broke the two people’s masks?

Roan, who was a mere common spearman, couldn’t knew.

He couldn’t knew of the truth that the royalties and the nobles’ veiled strifes were fiercer and more hideous than he had thought.

Roan forcefully shook off the distracting thoughts and raised his right hand up high.

“For now, we go to Tradi Castle!”

The northern wind blew.

“After resting, we will return to the capital, Miller! We……”

A smile hung on Roan’s mouth.

“Will return with confident and proud steps in triumph!”

The northern wind blew once more.

The wind headed towards the capital, Miller.

Gazing towards the south, Roan whispered in a quiet voice.

“Now……”

He spoke with a soft voice and light in his eyes.

“It is time to go home.”

Chapter 132




T/n (CSV): The first of three regular chapter of the week (Late chapter for Tuesday May 23rd). The 2nd chapter for the week (Thursday Chapter) will follow as soon as the editing is done.

“Me? I just did as I was told.”

“If I didn’t do as they said, I probably would have lost my neck.”

“Rebellion? I did know of it. But I didn’t like it. So I just pretended to fight.”

Elton Coat Barony troop’s soldiers all spewed out the same words like one.

The ones who raised a banner of rebellion against the Rinse Kingdom.

The reason they fell so helplessly despite starting the rebellion so pompously was because the soldiers, who should have been putting their lives on the line fighting, all tried to save their own lives.

Of course, they only mindlessly followed the orders from above and most had surrendered or ran once the situation turned disadvantageous.

‘I only need to take down the core members.’

Truthfully, he would have beheaded all the accomplices regardless of their ranks if the they were royalty or nobles.

It was because they had the standing and wealth to gather power at any time.

They had the clear possibility of becoming the seeds of trouble.

But the ordinary commoners were different.

Even if they were kept alive, the chance of them becoming a danger was significantly minute.

Especially in the case of the soldiers like the Coat Barony troop, this was even more so.

And.

‘If I take these soldiers into my faction……’

It wouldn’t simply stop at increasing the number of soldiers.

If the soldiers and their families migrated to the Tale Barony, that should solve the Tale region’s problem, where the population is small compared to the extensive land, to a certain extent.

Because of these various reasons, Roan gave those besides the core members, who started the rebellion, a chance to start over anew.

And like that, the Coat Barony troops were absorbed below the Tale Legion.

‘This is the last chance! There’s no other way but to surrender and go along with them if I want to live!’

The Coat Barony troops’ soldiers also understood that the only way to keep their lives was to follow Roan.

Like that, the fief’s citizens, who participated in the rebellion to earn an extra coin or two or were forced by the people above them, were all reborn as Roan’s soldiers.

Thanks to that, the Tale Legion, which numbered ten thousand at the march ceremony and was reduced to eight thousand due to the repeated battles, became reformed into a nearly twenty thousand strong legion.

“Amazing.”

“Not only strength, even his tricks aren’t normal either.”

Mills and Chester watched Roan and the Tale Legion and shook their heads.

It was a sincere admiration.

‘It’s certainly a brilliant talent.’

‘He’s different than those greenhorns called the 12 Hatchling or something.’

Of course, it wasn’t as if there was such a big difference that they could only marvel at him.

‘If I thoroughly prepare and then face him, I can easily take him down.’

‘I definitely won’t lose the next time.’

Mills and Chester vowed for the future and departed first towards the capital, MIller, while leading their legion.

To them, there was nothing left to do at Tradi Castle.

The Coat Barony, including the Tradi Castle, was already Roan’s territory.

Roan was only able to head towards the capital, Miller, after rebuilding the numerous villages that were damaged from the battles and looking after those who were hurt.

Of course, he left Austin and five thousand soldiers and had them be on their guard in case of an unexpected situation.

The day Roan and the Tale Legion departed.

Everywhere Roan went, the fief’s citizens poured out to shout and clap.

They were thankful to the Tale Legion who, despite technically being no different than an occupying force, had relieved the citizens’ difficulties instead of acting without restraint.

“Thank you for your time until now!”

“Thank you very much!”

“Please do come back!”

Some residents even showed tears from their gratitude and feelings of sadness at their departure.

‘This is the sight that I want.’

Not one of citizens was crying from frustration and fear, but from happiness and joy.

Roan made a smile towards them and spurred his horse forward.

Although he had achieved a complete victory thanks to Clay’s strategy and perfect abilities, the greater victory was winning the hearts of the fief’s citizens.

Word for word, it was a perfect and triumphant return.

*****

The capital, Miller, shook greatly for once.

“So he’s finally coming back?”

“The hero of the last expedition and the hero of the rebellion suppression this time, Sir Baron Roan Tale.”

“He’s truly an amazing person. He stepped ahead of those talented sirs and cut down the head of the rebellion!”

The castle’s citizens were all busy talking about Roan’s story.

The feverish mood was even hotter than the time of the last expedition’s triumphant return.

This was all because Roan, who had just became a noble, won in a competition with Mills and Chester, who were called the kingdom’s future.

And it was also an overwhelming victory.

“I heard he went up the river on a great fleet of boats?”

“Just when did he prepare those ships?”

“That’s not all. With an ambush, he annihilated the Byron Kingdom’s troops that marched to help the rebels.”

The heated praises of Roan’s meticulous preparations and tricks continued on.

Because he hadn’t simply suppressed the rebellion but completely suppressed them with overwhelming and fantastic tactic, he received even greater attention.

“Anyway, it looks like his majesty the king is also really happy.”

“Yeah. Just look at that triumphal arc.”

They turned towards the grand triumphal arc built on top of the wide square.

On the gigantic triumphal arc that hundreds of architects had swarmed through for days and nights, a brilliant and beautiful design was carved.

“From what I heard, they say Prince Simon and Sir Duke Bradley Webster had actively proposed it.”

“They probably did. To them, Sir Baron Tale is no different than a ball of luck.”

“Kuu! It must look seriously awesome if I were to walk through that victory gate and enter the palace just like that!”

From here and there, exclamations of awe popped out.

At that moment.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

The sound of a bell noisily echoed from the north gate.

“He’s here!”

“He finally arrived!”

The castle’s residents instinctively turned towards the north.

The sound of the bell endlessly echoed out.

That was the bell sound of welcome that celebrated Roan and the Tale Legion’s triumphant return.

*****

“I, is this really a welcome ceremony for us?”

“A, amazing.”

The Tale Legion’s soldiers, with dazed expressions, gazed around themselves.

Flower petals and colored confetti endlessly fell on top of their heads.

Thundering cheers that filled their ears.

Welcoming crowd that tightly filled the street.

They couldn’t believe that all of these were for them.

The shock of the previously Coat Barony Troop’s soldiers who were recruited this time as Tale Legion’s soldiers was especially great.

‘A, are we really allowed to receive this welcome?’

‘Even though we were rebels just a few days ago.’

At that moment, the soldiers near them happily shouted.

“It looks like everyone in the capital has come out!”

“I can really feel my heart jumping!”

Their entire bodies sharply trembled from the pouring cheers.

“There’s no need to make so much fuss.”

One of the soldiers spoke in a quiet voice while waving at the crowd.

The soldiers, who were engrossed in watching the crowd with elated faces, creased their brows.

“What do you mean?”

“Doesn’t this situation make you excited?”

The sound of complaints against him came pouring down.

Then the soldier who spoke up first turned towards them and replied.

“You’ll have a lot more experiences like this if you continue to serve Sir Baron Tale from now on, so there’s no need to be so excited.”

“Ah……”

Immediately, all of them quietly exclaimed.

Then they soon nodded their heads.

‘Right. If it’s Sir Baron Tale, he is someone who will raise even greater achievement than this.’

‘There’s no way this will be the last one.’

The soldiers who had been fussing about coughed and stood up straight.

With awkward faces and poses, they waved at the crowd.

“Waaaaa!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

“Tale Legion! Tale Legion!”

The cheers became even louder when the soldiers responded.

Roan’s name echoed throughout Miller.

Roan, who was riding his horse at the head of the legion, didn’t lose his calm even in the cheers that came pouring down.

His face was relaxed and composed.

But he too was extremely astonished on the inside.

‘I didn’t expect it to be this much.’

Although he thought that there would be a welcoming event or a crowd, the sight in front of his eyes had completely jumped beyond his expectations.

Especially the enormous triumphal arc built in the plaza at the end of the street was something he couldn’t even have imagined.

“A triumphal arc……’

In the last life, there was a time when he passed through the triumphal arc as a mere common spearman.

At the time, the grand commander was none other than Pierce.

But now.

‘I’m proudly returning in triumph as a legion commander.’

Furthermore, as a noble with the standing as a baron.

It was the difference between earth and sky compared to the last life.

All the while, Roan busily rode his horse and stood in front of the triumphal arc.

Clop. Clop.

The horse, which had been walking on top of the street, finally passed through the triumphal arc.

Hwaaah!

A gust of wind suddenly blew.

No, it felt like a wind had blown.

An indescribable delight wrapped around his entire body.

‘It’s quite hair-raising.’

It felt as if the hairs on his entire body stood up.

Through his head, the events of the past quickly brushed past.

Coming back in time, the Battle of Ale Gorge, the Battle of Pedian Plain, the War with the Istel Kingdom, Poskein Exodus, and even the rebellion suppression.

It truly was a time where he ran breathlessly.

In that time, an insignificant newbie spearman became a baron and a legion commander.

It was an incredibly amazing success.

But.

‘I can’t be satisfied and settle with just this.’

Roan dreamt of an even bigger dream.

‘I just need to do as I have done until now.’

He tightly clenched the horse’s reins.

‘I will definitely be a monarch.’

When he had newly hardened his determination, he could see familiar faces at the end of the street beyond the triumphal arc.

‘Hmm.’

For a moment, Roan’s face slightly blushed.

Thanks to Kalian’s Tears, he could see the people that came out on top of the palace’s wall clearly.

Prince Simon, Prince Tommy, and Prince Kallum as well as the four dukes and the distinguished nobles all came out and were watching Roan’s triumphant return.

But the place Roan’s gaze stayed at wasn’t the center of the palace wall but the side of the left corner.

A few princesses were gathered around there, and amongst them was Princess Aily Rinse.

‘Princess Aily……’

Strangely, his heart beat rapidly.

His face that was composed even against the incredible welcoming crowd loosened slightly.

The tips of his eyes trembled and the ends of his lips went up bit by bit.

Simon and the others weren’t even in his eyes anymore.

Even the noisy welcoming crowd’s cheers slowly felt quieter.

‘Really, why am I like this?’

Roan had known everything and had shown outstanding performances in everything, but in truth he didn’t even properly understand his own feelings.

He simply stared with brightly blushed face straight into Aily’s far away eyes.

“Hm?”

Meanwhile, Aily, who was watching Roan’s triumphant return from the top of the palace wall, unconsciously let out a short exclamation.

“What is it, princess?”

The guardian knight Greg Katis, who had been near her, slightly lowered his head then cautiously asked.

At those words, Aily glanced at the princesses nearby then replied in a quiet voice.

“I think I met Sir Baron Tale’s eyes just now.”

“Yes?”

With a slightly surprised face, Greg looked towards Roan.

But because the distance was too far, it was impossible to even see his expression.

“Princess. Even for me, who has learned a mana technique, simply seeing Baron Tale’s outline is all I could do.”

“But I definitely……”

Aily tried to reply once again but soon closed her mouth.

Even to her eyes, Roan was simply too far apart.

‘But it definitely felt like I met his eyes.’

She swallowed the words that went up to her throat.

She couldn’t explain the reason, but she felt certain.

If it wasn’t that their eyes had met.

‘Our hearts must have met’

Her heart rapidly jumped.

Her face brightly blushed.

Making an awfully shy and happy smile, she gazed at Roan.

Although the two were still much too far apart, their gazes at least were directed at each other.

It was a distance that would someday be closed, and it was a bond that would someday be

Probably.

*****

“Hahaha! Baron Tale! You did really well!”

Simon fully opened his two arms and welcomed Roan.

Roan gave a short salute then lowered his head.

“I’m glad I could complete the mission.”

“Hahaha! There’s no need to be so humble. I know that this rebellion suppression is your complete victory!”

Simon grabbed both of Roan’s shoulders.

His face was full of joy.

With the rebellion suppression this time, Simon’s stock had once again risen greatly.

Some of the nobles who supported the neutral faction even declared their support.

“Baron Tale. Good work.”

Viscount Tio Ruin, who had been next to them, gave a faint smile.

Roan slightly lowered his head instead of answering back.

The mood was full of happiness.

Of course, that was only on Simon’s side.

“Cht!”

“Hmph! Unsightly bastard!”

Tommy and Kallum glanced at Roan and burst out in anger.

Next to them, Mills and Chester stood in place with stiff expressions.

They had already received glares unlike glares and rebukes in the past few days. 1

Of course, the situation wasn’t such that Tommy and Kallum could throw them out because of that.

However the things were, Mills and Chester were sons of dukes and their talents were also that of outstanding geniuses amongst geniuses.

At that moment, the grand chamberlain, Viscount Logan, showed himself.

With the staff he held, he knocked on the marble floor three times.

“The sun of the kingdom, and the deputy of the god Krea, His Majesty Deni III is coming. The loyal retainers of the kingdom, show your manners.”

Immediately, the nobles who had been chatting all closed their mouths and deeply bowed.

Soon, Deni Von Rinse appeared in a splendid suit.

The very moment he sat down on the throne, he called out Roan’s name.

“Baron Roan Tale! Hahaha! I heave heard of your performance. It truly was excellent!”

Deni III laughed out aloud as he nodded his head.

Roan went up to the throne and kneeled down on one knee.

“I simply did what must be done. Your majesty.”

Roan’s voice was composed and his manners courteous.

Deni III brightly smiled and leaned his back on the throne.

“Since you have splendidly suppressed the rebels, I should judge your merits and grant rewards. First……”

As he first promised, he granted Coat Barony’s total authority and wealth to Roan.

Not only that, he even gave all the authority and wealth of the previous Gary Renard’s fief that Elton had taken over as he wished.

Several nobles sulked and complained but were forced to close their mouths under Simon and Duke Bradley Webster’s powerful support.

The rewards didn’t end with that.

Deni III called Simon, who had nominated Roan, and praised his eyes as well as tell him that he had become one step closer in becoming the Grand Duke of Grain, thus making the other two princes nervous.

‘So I cannot rise to be Grand Duke of Grain with only this.’

Simon was slightly angered since the nomination of the Grand Duke was once again postponed, but soon calmed his feelings.

It was because the fact was that he was far ahead of the other princes.

When Simon went back to his original place, Deni III once again spoke with an excited voice.

“Since you have consecutively raised big merits, I cannot end the rewards with just this. Is there perhaps something you want? Should I make you another privilege rights?” 2

Roan faintly smiled and shook his head at those words.

“I am fine with the privilege right. But there is something I do want.”

“Oh! What is it?”

Deni III quietly exclaimed.

Roan slightly lowered his head and exhaled a short sigh.

‘Now is the time to go back to Tale Barony. It is time to strengthen the basis. For that, several things are needed.’

Most of them were something Roan could take care of on his own.

But there were some that he couldn’t.

Roan raised his head and looked towards Deni III.

The smile hanging on his mouth became slightly deeper.

“There is someone I would like to recommend to the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander position that is currently empty.” 3

A wind blasted through the grand hall.

That was the wind of change.

Of course, the one who raised that wind was Roan.

“glares unlike glares” is a rather tricky phrase to translate. In short, it’s a case of nobles and the two princes venomously glaring at Mills and Chester, but not in a way that is obvious. Thus, they are glaring at Mills and Chester, but not really in a technical sense since that would create internal problems in the factions. ↩

Chapter 133




T/n (CSV): The 2nd chapter for the week (Chapter for Thursday 5/25/17).

Also, for those who didn’t know yet, I usually post notices about delays for next chapters and whatnot on top of the latest chapter, so please check it out if there are any delays.

Update: I’m really sorry, but I’m ashamed to say that I wasn’t able to finish the Sunday’s chapter this weekend. The chapter 134 turned out to be more difficult to translate than I expected, and it’s slowing me down quite a bit. Thankfully, I am more than halfway through it and ch.135 looks much easier, so I should be able to finish both and upload them by tomorrow.

Edit: “Beulo” has been changed to “Buro”.

After Benjamin Doyle, the position of the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander was left empty.

It wasn’t because there wasn’t much time nor because there wasn’t a suitable person.

No, instead there was an overflowing number of people.

The problem was the three dukes: Edwin Voisa, Bradley Webster, and Liss Kowan.

To place their subordinate onto the Supreme Commander’s seat, they repeatedly competed fiercely. Thanks to that, the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander’s position was drifting about empty.

And when Roan stepped forward in this situation and said that he would nominate someone, Edwin and Liss’s faces harden stiffly.

‘Is he trying to nimbly swallow one of the key regional corps roles?’

‘If not careful, the table will completely turn towards Prince Simon.’

On the other hand, a peculiar anticipation appeared on Bradley’s face.

‘Oh! The Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander is it? Right! It’s the perfect opportunity!’

If he could bring the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander into the support faction, Simon could receive a big boost in the succession competition.

At that moment, King Deni Von Rinse spoke up.

“Right. Who is this person you would like to nominate?’

In the first place, Deni III was having a headache with nominations for the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander.

‘With the three dukes, no the four dukes even including Duke Francis Wilson harassing me, my head hurts like hell.’

Due to that, he planned to use Roan as an excuse and finish the nomination if the nominee wasn’t too bad.

Deni III brightly smiled and gazed at Roan.

Roan calmly looked back at that gaze and replied.

“He is Baron Aaron Tate, Commander of the 7th corps of Eastern Regional Corps.”

“Aaron…… Tate?”

Deni III turned towards the dukes while slightly creasing his brows.

No, to be exact, he looked at Duke Francis Wilson.

It was because he couldn’t quite remember the name Aaron Tate.

‘If it’s Baron Aaron Tate, he should be the commander that raised a large merit in the war with the Istel Kingdom.’

Francis brought up the information about Aaron in his head.

‘He is the one who proposed himself as Baron Roan Tale’s supporter. Even so, it’s rather ambiguous to call him Prince Simon’s supporter…… he should be categorized as part of the neutral faction.’

Neutral faction.

In other words, he wasn’t supported by any of the three princes’ factions.

Because of that, he was pushed to the back amongst the nominees for the supreme commander position despite having the most outstanding achievements.

In the merit judgments and rewards after the war with the Istel Kingdom, all he was given were some reward money and three borderside cities.

‘If we just look at the person, he isn’t a bad choice.’

Francis ended his short contemplation and slightly nodded his head.

A movement such that no one around him would notice.

Only Deni III, who was watching Francis, was able to know.

‘It seems Duke Wilson likes him too.’

Seeing a sign of the end to the horrible nomination for the Supreme Commander, Deni III made a faint smile.

But soon, his smile disappeared.

‘Hmm.’

His gaze moved towards the other three dukes.

‘All of their faces are quite awful.’

Although Edwin and Liss had stiff expressions from the start, in Bradley’s case, his expression quickly changed once he heard Roan’s nomination.

‘Aaron Tate?’

Bradley also knew much about Aaron.

He knew that Aaron was an excellent individual and that he was a suitable person for the Supreme Commander position.

But he was never the person he wanted.

‘Even though there are countless talented geniuses amongst Prince Simon’s close aides……’

If they weren’t right, there were also plenty of people suitable to be Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander amongst his own close aides.

But pushing aside those people and nominating Aaron, who was not only categorized as part of the neutral faction and wasn’t any different from a country bumpkin from a border region, as the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander was a solely regrettable choice.

‘But even so, it’s not as if I could blindly stop this either.’

Bradley gritted his teeth.

He didn’t like the person too much, but either way, Aaron had a good relationship with Roan.

If he could coax him well, it was more than possible to absorb him into Prince Simon’s faction.

‘For now, I better go with supporting him.’

Bradley deeply inhaled.

In the end, he had decided to support Roan’s decision.

At that moment.

“Baron Aaron Tate…… what kind of person is he?”

Deni III asked almost off-handedly.

Francis answered as if he was waiting.

“He is a corp commander that showed great performance in the recent war with the Istel Kingdom. He is a person who raised an outstanding achievement even amongst the candidates for the supreme commander. Also, he has received the trust of the citizens and evaluations of him aren’t……”

For a while, he listed off the information within his head.

“Hhm.”

Deni III nodded with a pleased expression after listening to the entire story.

“As expected of Baron Tale. You proposed quite an excellent individual.”

He gazed around at the dukes and the numerous nobles and continued to speak.

“Since he is a splendid individual with such merits and evaluations, there shouldn’t be any problem in nominating him as the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander, yes?”

Truthfully, he wished that it would pass easily.

But there was no way that Edwin and Liss would back down just like that.

“This decision is for nominating a supreme commander who will be responsible for one of the vital parts of the Regional Corps. I don’t think that this is a work that should be decided so easily.”

“Furthermore, Baron Tate is still a young warrior. I’m worried whether his experience isn’t lacking to lead the entire Eastern Regional Corps.”

An objection was an objection.

But the mood was peculiar.

Bradley’s eyes glinted and shone with light.

‘Unlike the last several heated debates, it looks like they plan to more or less agree and pass it.’

His eyes were quick.

In the first place, it wasn’t possible to leave the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander position empty.

Then, it was more advantageous for Edwin and Liss to have Aaron, who was categorized as part of the neutral faction, to sit there.

Although, because Aaron and Roan’s had a very friendly relationship, there needed a suitable security device.

“The Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander’s position has been empty for months. Do you propose that we continue to waste our time?”

Edwin coughed when Bradley complained.

“Hmm. Your words are right.”

He met eyes with Liss for a moment then slightly nodded his head.

Looking at Deni III and the various nobles, Edwin continued to speak.

“Then how about promoting someone who can assist Baron Tate, who is a young warrior, to the position of vice commander?”

For a moment, a corner of Bradley’s lips went up.

‘Hmph. So they’re asking to hand over the vice commander position in return for giving up the Supreme Commander position.’

In other words, a desire to set the balance.

He felt like immediately rejecting them, but the thing called politics wasn’t something that could be done so impetuously without regards just like that.

Bradley forcefully smiled and nodded his head.

“As expected of Duke Voisa. That seems to be quite an excellent method.”

By this point, the four dukes glanced at each other and then nodded.

It meant an agreement to each concede and step back.

Edwin bowed towards Deni III.

“We believe that appointing Baron Aaron Tate as Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander and appoint Baron Ive Lever, who currently has the role of head staff officer of the Eastern Regional Corps, and Baron Taylor Nicoles, who is a veteran warrior, as the vice commanders should be good.”

Ive Lever was Liss’s person, and Taylor was Edwin’s person.

The rest of the dukes all nodded their heads and agreed.

Seeing that sight, Deni III made the decision.

“Alright. Proceed as so.”

“Yes. Your Majesty.”

All the nobles lowered their heads.

Roan, seeing how the things were ultimately finished as he wished despite the four duke’s intervention, faintly smiled.

‘It’s done. Now that Commander Tate has been appointed to the position to oversee the entire eastern border, I should be able to receive various help. And also……’

There was another reason why Roan nominated Aaron to the position of the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander.

‘Originally, Commander Tate should have risen to the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander position after discovering Brent’s Ring.’

But as he had found the ring first and kept it, Aaron had forever lost that opportunity.

‘Although I may take the things I need for my goals and dreams, I want to give another different chance to those who should have been the owners of those things.’

Of course, villainous or problematic people were exceptions.

Mills Voisa was a prime example.

‘Because after learning the Flamdor Mana Technique, he betrayed the kingdom and defected to the Estia Empire.’

But to those with ability and a virtuous nature like Aaron, he wanted to give them as much help as the chances they should originally have had.

When his thoughts were continuing on.

“Is there anything else you wish?”

He heard Deni III’s voice.

Making an amicable smile, he looked at Roan.

“Instead of something that’s good for others, ask me something that will also benefit you.”

Numerous nobles once again made nervous expressions.

Roan pondered for a moment then lowered his head once more.

“Then without holding back, I shall request your majesty once more.”

“Yes. Say it.”

Deni III lightly nodded his head.

Roan spoke with a quiet and serious voice.

“I wish to vanquish the monster of the Poskein Lake with the fleet your subject has.”

As soon as he said those words.

“Un?”

“Unn?”

The four dukes as well as every noble, the three prince, and even the king, Deni III, all made surprised faces.

It was because those words were completely unexpected.

‘Even though I was planning on stopping him if he tried to nominate someone again or desire a position……’

‘Not only uselessly making a fleet, but to say that he’ll vanquish the Poskein Lake’s monsters…… he must have lost his mind.’

‘He’s spewing nonsense again after doing so well.’

The dukes soon snickered and shook their heads.

There wasn’t any need to interfere or keep this in check.

In the first place, Poskein Lake was a useless place for them.

That, for Deni III, was also the same.

“Vanquish the Poskein Lake’s monsters?”

“Yes. That is so. Your Majesty.”

Roan answered with a courteous voice.

Deni III shook his hand as if it was nothing and spoke.

“I’m not sure what good that will do, but do as you wish if you are insistent on it. Ah! No, no.”

He shook his head and instead made the things even bigger.

“In the first place, Poskein Lake is a useless piece of land. It’s a place that none of the four kingdoms around the lake pay any attention to. With the order of the king, I’ll specially grant the Poskein Lake to you. Vanquish the monsters, or release the monster onto it, do as you wish.”

It was a shocking statement.

But the various nobles only made slightly surprised expressions and didn’t go out of their way to object nor interfere.

‘What’ll he do by receiving a place like that?’

‘That place where no one even know how many monsters live in.’

‘Not even looking at it is much more safer.’

They didn’t have any interest in Poskein Lake.

The lake was just that dangerous.

Furthermore, that thought was even more solidified after the last Poskein Exodus.

‘Baron Tale sure is strange. To be interested in Poskein Lake.’

Even Simon, whose judgment was clear and his head bright, couldn’t understand Roan’s actions.

On the other hand, Roan couldn’t hide his smile.

“Thank you very much. Your Majesty.”

He deeply lowered his head and let out a sharp sigh.

He simply wished to use his troops however much he wanted to to vanquish the Poskein Lake’s monsters.

But the things became even bigger instead and he earned the complete authority over the entirety of Poskein Lake.

Now, Roan had became the owner of Poskein Lake which had the area reaching almost 70% the size of the Rinse Kingdom.

Of course, the other kingdoms wouldn’t acknowledge, no they didn’t even have any interest in this.

*****

After suppressing Elton Coat’s rebellion and returning to Miller, Roan was passing even busier days than before.

It was all because of the visits and invitations that poured down.

Furthermore, the problem of taking care of Renard Barony and Coat Barony that he received as rewards complicated his head.

Because it was simply too far away from the Tale Barony, it was almost impossible to directly manage it.

At that moment, Clay proposed an excellent solution.

First, he took a part of the fiefs off and gave the Renard Barony over to Count Io Lancephil, who had taken off a part of his own fief to create and gift Tale Barony.

Io refused with all sort of words, but begrudgingly decided to receive it after Roan repeatedly requested.

In the case of the Coat Barony, he received a suitable amount of money from Simon and rented it out to him.

The idea of renting out a fief was truly unheard of, but Clay, who had no bias or preconceived notions, didn’t think much of it.

In the end, the things proceeded as his plan.

Thankfully, Simon was also looking for a fief to use as a northern base, so he immediately accepted Roan’s proposal.

With the problem regarding the two fiefs that he received as rewards resolved, Roan quickly prepared to go back to the Tale Barony.

In this process, the original soldiers of Simon and Tio Ruin left the Tale Legion, which previously reached twenty thousand strong, resulting in the Tale Legion becoming just over ten thousand strong.

“Oh! They must be that Tale Legion.”

“Is it the combination of the Amaranth troop, famously known as strong, and the Coat Barony troops, who were rebels?”

“Maybe because of that, they’re a complete mess.”

Six men in their primes wearing shabby suits watched the Tale Legion, which were setting up formations on the plain outside the capital, Miller, and shook their heads.

“We came here on Principal Brown’s request, but would he really be that great a person as the rumors say?”

“We’ll know if we meet him.”

“I don’t care about other things, I just hope his thoughts are a bit more open. I don’t want to hear words like ‘can’t do this’ or ‘can’t do that’ anymore.”

The six filthy looking men were in fact a few of the problematic graduates whom Principal Fred Brown had mentioned.

“For now, should we go to where Sir Baron Tale is residing?”

When one man spoke, the rest of them nodded and directed their steps towards the capital, Miller.

Passing through the castle gates, they walked down the well-maintained street and arrived at the temporary mansion that Roan was residing in.

“It’s even more noisy than a shopping street.”

“Looks like the number of visitors is amazing.”

The six men glanced at the people that completely filled both the inside and outside of the mansion and shook their heads.

Most of the visitors were nobles or rich merchants in fabulous suits and armor.

Compared to them, the creases on the six men’s clothes were clear and their head and skin were rough and completely lacked any luster.

They literally looked only slightly better than beggars.

“It would be good if we aren’t refused and get chased out.”

“You said it.”

The men looked at each other’s looks and laughed.

At that moment, a clean-suited middle-aged man approached.

“I’m Onil of Baron Tale’s house. May I ask the occasion of your visit?”

He spoke in a very respectful and courteous manner.

One man amongst the six answered as the group’s representative.

“We came to meet Sir Baron.”

“For now, could you please tell me your names?”

Onil opened a thick guest book.

The six men went around and revealed their names.

Swift, Buro, Raitler, Rotner, Griffin, Nuns.

They purposely didn’t reveal their surnames.

They wanted to see the reaction of Baron Tale’s house while hiding their identities.

“We heard that he utilizes talented people, so we came hoping to see if we could take a seat.”

They also hid the facts that they were Tron Academy graduates as well as that they came because of Fred’s recommendation.

“We currently have a large number of visitors, so it may take some time. For now, allow me to guide you to the reception room.”

Onil wrote down the names onto the guest book and walked a step ahead of them.

The six men made strange smiles as they followed behind.

The reception room that seemed to have been temporarily expanded was genuinely clean.

As soon as they sat down on the empty seat, tea and cookies were prepared.

“Once your turn arrives, I will guide you in.”

Onil once again lowered his head then went back to his seat.

“For now, it doesn’t look like they judge people based on appearances.”

“Of course. Judging people from their appearances is something only fledglings do.”

The six men raised the tea cups and smiled.

Looking around the reception room, it looked like the meeting was done based on the order of arrival.

It had no relation with status or wealth.

It was a truly fair and impartial method.

After a significant amount of time.

“It’s taking longer than I thought.”

Swift, who was sort of a leader amongst the six man, made a bitter smile.

Enough time for the refreshments to come out thrice had already passed.

But it seemed as if there was still quite a number of people left before their turns would arrive.

“Can’t be helped. We can’t simply wait like this.”

“Right. Time is money.”

Swift nodded at those words and called Onil.

Onil, who was organizing the guest book, cautiously approached and lowered his head.

“Should I bring out more refreshments?”

At the question, Swift shook his head.

He glanced around for some reason and then spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Actually, all of us are descendants of noble houses and graduates of Tron Academy.”

With him revealing his status and identity, even his manner of speech had changed.

Onil opened his eyes slightly wider than nodded his head.

“Ah, is that so, sir?”

Then he soon found Swift and the men’s names on the guest book and added in the story he just heard on the side.

The six men watched Onil and neatened their clothes.

They were preparing to meet Roan.

After finishing writing down the notes, Onil closed the guest book, turned towards Swift and the men, and gave a faint smile.

“Then……”

As soon as he spoke up, the six men slightly stood up from their seat.

‘Now, he should be asking us to follow him, right?’

But the rest of Onil’s words were completely different than their expectations.

“Should I bring out more refreshments?”

Immediately, the six men’s movements paused.

“Hm?”

With their bottoms slightly off the chairs, they froze while standing.

Swift spoke with a slightly flustered look.

“No, we are all descendents of noble houses……”

“And you were graduates of Tron Academy? Please don’t worry. I clearly wrote it down on the guest book.”

“Ah, no, that, that is……”

Swift and the men’s faces twisted comically.

Onil looked at the six men’s faces and smiled.

“Your turn will soon come. Please be patient.”

He then slightly lowered his head and returned to his original seat.

Swift and the men, who were dumbfoundedly watching Onil’s back, fell back down onto their seats and gulped.

“Huh! Did, did we just get ignored?”

“Ha. I had heard Sir Baron Tale highly regarded talented people…… so that rumor was incorrect?”

“This kind of disrespect sure is a first.”

Complaints kept spewing out of the six men’s mouths.

At that moment.

“Cht cht ch. Fledglings.”

A humorous voice was heard along with the sound of a clicking tongue.

The six men, whose mood were already offended, all turned their heads at the same time.

The owner of the voice was a mischievous looking middle-aged man.

“Are you the one that just said that?”

“That’s right. You immature fledglings.”

Raitler immediately flew in a rage and stood up.

“Fledglings? Who do you even think we are to say that?!”

“Didn’t you say you were Tron Academy graduates?”

The man answered nonchalantly.

The six men creased their foreheads.

“And you’re still calling us fledglings?”

“Of course I call immature fledglings fledglings, what else should I call instead?”

Swift snorted as soon as he said that.

“Hmph! To dare call us fledglings! Just who are you?”

“I can tell with just a glance that you’re a vagrant warrior.”

“You look horrible.”

At those words, the man snickered and laughed.

“Pff! You called judging people with their appearance as something only fledglings do, but you are exactly that.”

“Hmm.”

The six men groaned as they made awkward expressions.

The middle-aged man turned his body and placed his hand on his chin.

“And to not even recognize this handsome face, even your life experiences are lacking.”

“Ha, handsome face? Just who are you to be so arrogant and impudent?”

Swift could hold himself back and shouted.

The middle-aged man brightly smiled as he answered.

“Me? I’m……”

A light shone on his mischievous face.

“Reil Baker.”

The genius of the spear and Pierce’s master, Viscount Reil Baker.

He had appeared out of nowhere in the capital, Miller.

And alone without any companion.

Chapter 134




T/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter.

Edit: “Beulo” has been changed to “Buro”.

“Si, sir Viscount Baker?!”

“The genius of the spear!”

Chaos.

The people fell into utter chaos.

They completely hadn’t expected that Reil Baker, the kingdom’s greatest spearman and a noble, would be sitting in a corner of an impromptu reception room.

More specifically, the six men: Swift, Buro, Raitler, Rotner, Griffin, and Nuns, became mutes that ate honey and shut their mouths. 1

Onil, who was organizing the awaiting visitors, became shocked and ran up a moment later, but Reil lightly shook his head and decided to quietly wait until his turn came.

“But wasn’t Sir Viscount Baker supposed to be on a training journey?”

“Right. I heard he went somewhere deep in the Grain Mountain Range.”

“It looks like he has finally descended.”

The people sneakily glanced at Reil and whispered.

Because he wasn’t seen in important battles including the war with the Istel Kingdom and the Poskein Monster Exodus, groundless rumors had spread abundantly.

From the rumors of illness to death, and even rumors that said he betrayed the kingdom circulated.

In the end, Viscount Baker’s house officially announced that Reil was on a training journey and the false rumors completely disappeared after that.

“U, um, Sir Viscount Baker……”

Amongst the chaos, Swift awkwardly smiled and looked at Reil.

Seemingly asking what is it, Reil tiled his head sideways.

“Please forgive my discourtesy just now.”

He spoke in a polite voice and manner.

Reil snickered at those words.

“There’s no need to apologize.”

He wasn’t the type to bother with such a minor things.

But.

“But if you are planning on walking together with Baron Tale, it looks like there’s a need to look back on yourselves. You pretend to be some sort of messiah or professionals, but in the end, you are trapped by facade of being sons of prideful nobles and graduates of the prominent Tron Academy. It ain’t right to measure yourselves and others with different standards, would it?”

“Hmm.”

Swift and the five man leaked out a groan.

The five dropped their heads and blushed in shame.

Reil watched them do so for a while then soon lost interest.

A moment later.

“Hey Swift. It won’t do like this.”

Raitler carefully spoke up with a quiet voice.

“I’m so ashamed that I can’t take this. To think I would act just like those of whom I hated and was disgusted of.”

He turned around towards his friends and continued.

“However I think about it, I need to study a bit more. A completely new kind of studying.”

As soon as he said those words, Buro and Rotner nodded.

“I too agree to that thought.”

“Right. I’ve been looking only at books while stuck in a mountain for so long that my mind has become inflexible. My eyes for the world have also darkened. I think I need a new kind of study just like what Raitler said.”

All of them closed their mouths and a strong light shone from their eyes.

Swift stared at those lights then carefully asked.

“Then, should we go study the world first?”

“Alright.”

All of them spoke in one voice.

Then they soon stood up from their seats and bowed towards Reil.

Reil, who had already been listening to their conversation, nodded his head without a word.

Swift sent his five friends out first then walked towards Onil.

Onil, who had been organizing the guest book, brightly smiled and stood up from his seat.

“Should I bring out more refreshments?”

His manners were still polite and courteous.

Swift shook his head.

“That isn’t it, sir. We had finally realized that our abilities are much too lacking.”

Perhaps because he had realized something, even his speech had changed once more.

“We will come back after learning more about the world.”

“Ah…… yes, understood. I will pray for your good health.”

Onil found Swift and the others’ names on the guest book then added an additional note.

Swift watched Onil for a moment then headed out of the reception room after giving a short bow.

Onil walked all the way out to the door and saw them off.

At that moment.

“Who are they for you to even come see them off?”

He heard a confident and self-assured voice.

Onil turned his gaze and then lowered his head.

The owner of the voice was Clay.

“They are the descendants of nobles and graduates of Tron Academy.”

“Is that so? Then why are they just leaving?”

Clay asked as he chased the backs of the six men, who already couldn’t be seen anymore.

Onil repeated the same words that he had just heard from Swift.

“They realized that their abilities are much too lacking and said that they will return after learning more about the world again.”

Clay chortled at those words.

“What kind of big things could they possibly do without certainty and trust in their own abilities……”

Clay was certainly different.

He, who was overflowing with confidence in every action, couldn’t understand Swift and the others’ actions.

“Even though there are so many people coming here like this, there doesn’t seem to be anyone that can compare to my talents.”

Clay whispered in a quiet voice as he slowly moved his steps.

In no time, he too went far away until he couldn’t be seen anymore.

Onil, who had been standing still until then, made a bitter smile as he exhaled a short sigh.

“Sir Clay, even if your eyes are small, it’s not good to see even the world in a small way.”

He knew.

That the six men, who had understood shame on their own and walked out of the world once again, would one day come back as great men.

‘At that time, I will once again write down your names.’

Onil faintly smiled and went back into the temporary reception room.

His duty still hadn’t finished.

***

“Congratulations on becoming the kingdom’s noble.”

“If I had known that sir would come, I would have separately received you beforehand.”

“I can’t do that. Since I came without contacting you, waiting is the right thing to do.”

Roan and Reil asked about each other’s healths with a small table between them.

“By the way……”

Roan, who had been chatting along, awkwardly smiled and left his words open.

Reil, who was quick to notice, cheerily smiled and finished the sentence.

“Where is Pierce, is it?”

At those words, Roan slowly nodded his head.

Reil folded his arms and leaned his back on the chair.

A strange smile floated on his mouth.

“Actually, the reason why I came to find you is because of Pierce.”

“Did something perhaps happen?”

Roan asked with a worried look.

Reil nodded his head.

“Something did happened. But it’s not something bad.”

“Ah……”

Roan let out a quiet exclamation.

It was an exclamation of relief.

At that moment.

“Ah? It might be a bad thing for you.”

Reil spoke with a playful expression, and then continued on with a serious voice.

“Pierce is much more brilliant than I had thought.”

He stared straight into Roan’s eyes.

“It’s to the point where there’s nothing I can teach him anymore.”

Reil wished that Roan would be greatly surprised at this point.

However, Roan was more composed than he had thought.

Reil pouted.

“Isn’t it shocking?”

“It is shocking.”

Roan faintly smiled as he answered.

But on the inside, he was completely unsurprised.

‘Since it’s something I had already expected.’

The memories from the last life floated up.

‘The longer the time went on, he showed an even more incredible talent.’

It was far too soon to be surprised already.

“Somehow, I don’t feel excited anymore.”

Reil spat out a short sigh and shook his head.

“Anyhow, Pierce that guy is training by himself. Although there isn’t anything left to learn from me, he hasn’t overcome me yet, you see. He said that he’ll come down when he is satisfied with himself. You better prepare yourself.”

“Yes. Since we did say that we will compare our spearmanship the day he comes back.”

Roan thought of the day Pierce left and smiled.

Reil quietly stared at Roan.

“You’re calmer than I thought.”

“Yes. Instead, I’m looking forward to it.”

“Did your skills improve much?”

“Perhaps, I’m not too sure of that. But I too am also doing my best.”

Calm conversations kept flowing on.

Reil’s eyes squinted deeply.

‘Roan……’

When Reil met Roan again, he felt that he hadn’t changed nor improved much.

Although he could feel that Roan was relaxed, he thought that that was due to having various experiences.

He couldn’t feel any advance in his mana technique or strength.

But as he quietly sat facing him and looked carefully, there was definitely something that had changed.

‘How should I say it…… a feeling of a thick curtain hiding the light of a fire?’

A feeling as if he was hiding his true skills.

No, to be exact, it felt as if his true skills were blocked, as if there was some sort of restraint on them.

‘But it isn’t like it’s blocking his development……’

It was a sort of restraint that couldn’t be clearly understood even with Reil’s level.

‘The one thing for sure is that it isn’t a bad situation for Roan.’

He could be sure of at least that.

It was like a type of mechanism to maximize Roan’s potential.

‘If the curtain covering the light were to be pulled away……’

An incredible explosion of light would happen.

‘How intriguing.’

Pierce, who has potential whose depth and end couldn’t be seen, and Roan, who has an ordinary talent and an unknown restraint.

They were two people who, from a glance, doesn’t seem comparable, but if Roan were to overcome the current state, he would be able to achieve an incredible growth.

‘A misfortune turned into fortune.’

The smile on Reil’s mouth became even thicker.

‘This, the winds behind me are blowing too roughly.’

He too had just entered into his forties.

He had confidently assured himself that he was still one of the kingdom’s greatest warriors.

But the growth of the younger talents wasn’t insignificant.

Roan and Pierce. And the geniuses he also didn’t know.

It was a situation where he just may be pushed aside by the winds behind him.

‘Not yet. It won’t happen just yet……’

Reil deeply inhaled.

‘I should also go on an intensive training.’

He didn’t have any plans to give away the seat of the kingdom’s best spearman just yet.

Without a word, he extended his right hand.

Realizing its meaning, Roan quietly shook the hand.

‘Sir Viscount Baker.’

A blazing energy was felt throughout the entire hand.

It wasn’t something like mana.

That was the unique competitiveness, pride, and ambition of a warrior.

Roan faintly smiled.

‘I also don’t have any plans to remain at this level.’

He would be slow.

Compared to Pierce or Reil, the speed of his growth would definitely be infinitesimally slow.

But he had the confidence to not give up.

Roan. 2

‘I am just like a turtle, after all.’ 3

Even if he was slow, he planned to walk on much longer than others.

Even while they were resting, he planned to tirelessly walk on.

That, was Roan’s method.

***

Reil had left.

Although the palace and various nobles sent people to him a moment later, he rejected every request and invitation and went off training once again.

Roan had stayed.

He couldn’t leave.

Roan, Reil, and Pierce’s goals and targets were obviously different.

‘Since my dream isn’t to become the best spearman.’

The goal was to become a monarch.

Because of that, he had to stay, build his foundation, and raise the columns.

He had to build his dream on top of a solid foundation.

“Arnold, it’s certainly an interesting story.”

Roan faced the five young man standing in front of him and shook his head.

Arnold, who was the most leader-like amongst them, spoke with a slightly blushed face.

“The Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild was the guild that we were associated with until we joined the Amaranth troop. It was a significantly big place that spread its name just a few years ago, but it has currently fallen. But even so, it is a guild that various big and small mercenary bands are still associated with.”

Benson, who was standing next to him, added on.

“We knew that my lord has been recruiting mercenary bands on the side. We wondered whether it may help, so we wished to inform my lord.”

Arnold nodded his head.

“If my lord were to provide them a certain amount of funds each month, the entire mercenary guild will probably move to our fief.”

“Then tens of big and small mercenary bands will immediately become active with our fief as a base.”

Roan slowly nodded his head at the words that poured out without pausing.

“Alright. Try proceeding with the plan once.”

“Yes, please leave it to us, sir.”

Arnold clenched his fist as he lowered his head.

Then they exited the office only after bowing to Roan multiple times.

“Huu!”

A short sigh exhaled out.

“His face looked like he completely believed us, right?”

“Yeah. There weren’t any signs of doubt.”

The men talked with each other in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“This job is the last chance Sir Count Chase has given us. We have to catch Baron Tale’s eyes and pluck a high position for sure.”

At Arnold’s words, the other four young men nodded with nervous expressions.

The five young men who suggested the relocation of the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild.

They were in fact the spies that Viscount Jonathan Chase had planted in the Amaranth Troop.

At the moment when their lives were barely holding on from not having achieved much, they were given one last chance.

“Alright, let’s go meet the guild master for now.”

“That place has already been talked to, right?”

“Of course. I heard that Sir Viscount Chase had already prepared everything.”

They quickened their steps as they talked.

Meanwhile, Roan stayed in the office and was checking through thick files.

Austin, who had been standing by at the side, asked with a slightly worried look.

“Mercenaries are mens who are unruly from birth. Wouldn’t it be better to proceed more prudently on a guild-scale relocation?”

“Of course that’s how it should be.”

Roan nodded briefly.

While looking through the details of a document, he gave out a new order.

“Tell Keep to investigate the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild. In fact, tell him to infiltrate several members of the Tenebra Troop into the guild.”

“Yes, understood.”

Austin nodded his head and moved his feet.

At that moment.

Knock, knock, knock.

Along with the sound of knocking.

“President Chris has come.”

A welcoming news arrived.

“Tell him to come in.”

As soon as the permission was given, the door opened immediately.

Chris came into the room and lowered his head towards Roan.

Austin too exchanged brief greetings and exited the office.

“Thanks for coming all the way here.”

Roan offered a seat to Chris and sat on the opposite chair.

“No, it wasn’t much. Congratulations on brilliantly suppressing the rebellion.”

“It was all thanks to President Chris.”

Those words weren’t empty words.

Thanks to Chris sending Daiv’s fleet in a timely manner, and perfectly analysing and reporting Byron Kingdom Troop’s size and paths, the job was easily completed.

Roan shrugged as he stared at Chris.

“I did receive the news that you’ll be coming, but……”

He still didn’t know the reason why he came so suddenly.

Chris cheerily smiled as he answered.

“There were various events, so I took the opportunity to meet my lord. Anyhow……”

From his back, he took out a bundle of documents and laid them out.

“This is the essential information that we’ve collected, analyzed, and organized during the time.”

“Thanks for the work.”

Roan glanced through the incredible amount of information and nodded his head.

Chris continued to speak.

“Also, we have checked in with the five merchants that we’ve been providing support. Mr. Tio of the transportation business and Mr. Lego of the loan business said that they won’t be working with us anymore. Amongst the other three, Ms. Lidia of the lumber business and Ms. Eska of the restaurant business said that they will personally meet with my lord and then decide. And Mr. Ford of the mining business said he’ll unconditionally follow my lord.”

“Everyone is more cautious than I thought.”

“That’s the unique trait of merchants. Ms. Lidia and Ms. Eska are currently waiting in the reception room.”

“Is that so? Then I should go meet them.”

When Roan was about to stand up from his seat, Chris suddenly shook his head.

“There’s one more thing I need to report.”

His expression and voice changed.

His look was slightly serious.

Roan sat down again and spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“It seems something has happened.”

Chris wordlessly nodded and then answered.

“Although the news hasn’t reached the capital, Miller, yet, but the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom recently held each other’s hands and attacked Pershion Kingdom.”

“Hmm.”

Roan let out a quiet groan.

This was a completely unexpected event.

‘There’s no way that there would be a war that I don’t remember. This was definitely something that hadn’t happened in the last life.’

He did somehow feel that the Byron Kingdom’s reinforcements to Elton Coat were too weak.

In fact, the Byron Kingdom’s main goals and interests were not the Rinse Kingdom, but the Pershion Kingdom.

“It seems that the Byron Kingdom has judged now to be the right time to invade the Pershion Kingdom.”

Since the greatest enemy nation, the Rinse Kingdom, was all out of its mind due to the throne succession competition and Elton’s Rebellion.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

Chris’ reported continued on.

“Here, the Istel Kingdom seems to have requested food assistance from the Byron Kingdom while suffering from the large war reparations and deep drop in the crop yields. With military reinforcements in return.”

“Hmm.”

Roan once again leaked a groan.

‘In the end, did this war happen because of me……’

The intensification of the throne succession competition, Elton’s Rebellion, and the Istel Kingdom’s war reparations were all something that happened because of Roan.

‘How troublesome.’

He had expected the future to change based on the decisions he made.

But he didn’t know that a war that didn’t exist would have suddenly exploded out already.

It was much too fast than what he had thought.

“The one leading the Byron Kingdom Army was Baron Noel Kyword, and the one leading the Istel Kingdom Army was Viscount Peid Neil. Their strength was, with the two nations added together, a grand military might of one hundred thousand.”

The longer the report went on, Roan made a bitter smile.

‘So all the heroes that saved both nations from crisis had marched. And a military strength of one hundred thousand……’

It was literally a horrible situation for the Pershion Kingdom.

Roan stared straight into Chris’ eyes.

“And the result?”

An answer obvious enough to make the question a waste of time would come.

However, Chris didn’t easily answer and merely swallowed his saliva.

“The Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom’s allied forces……”

His eyes trembled sharply.

“Have lost.”

Boom.

Immediately, Roan’s eyes opened wide.

“They lost?”

His expression was one of disbelief.

“Yes. And it was a complete loss.”

Chris answered briefly.

“Just ho……”

Roan tried to ask back but suddenly stopped.

“Ah!”

A quiet exclamation came out of his mouth.

Roan calculated within his head then soon nodded his head.

‘Right. If it’s now, then he should still be alive.’

At that time, Chris’ answer continued.

“I also didn’t know of him yet, but there is an incredible person in the Pershion Kingdom. His name is……”

Roan gulped.

His heart rapidly jumped.

His face blushed brightly.

The one person amongst many whom Roan admired in the last life.

The one person who Roan couldn’t personally see but felt more idol-like because of that.

“Manus……”

Chris spoke the name in a quiet voice.

Roan unconsciously whispered within himself.

‘…… Pershion.’

Manus Pershion.

The second prince of the Pershion Kingdom and a majestic general.

‘The man whom God loved……’

In the last life, Manus’ nickname was the man whom God loved.

Perfect looks, an outstanding talent, and a noble character.

God has given him everything.

Word for word, he was the man who received God’s love.

However, God had loved him simply too much.

‘Because of that, he wasn’t left in the mortal world for very long.’

Manus Pershion.

At the age of merely twenty five, he left the world at a young age.

While helping out the relief for the poor, he had caught the the disease known as the worst disease, the Tarzes disease.

‘Yes, so this is when he is still alive.’

He had momentarily forgotten him due to his short life.

And at the timely moment, he heard Chris’ voice.

“Manus Pershion. He is a young man who is twenty four this year.”

In the raw, this sentence said “Roan was”, which is an incomplete sentence and definitely sound awkward in english. However, this was sort of artistic design by the author, as the “Roan was” and the “I am” part both rhymed and meant the same in Korean (“Roan was” – 로안은 – “loan-eun”, “I am” – 나는 – “naneun”). However, it still sounded awkward in english so we simplified it to “Roan”. ↩

Chapter 135




T/n (CSV): The 3nd chapter for last week (Chapter for Thursday 5/25/17). Thank you very much for your patience. The next chapter (1/3 of this week) will be up tomorrow.

Update: Um… ch.136 will be a bit late. Sigh… maybe I should just move all the release schedule a day back so that they’re on time…

‘Twenty four.’

Roan let out a short sigh.

‘There’s only one year left.’

Time was tight..

Even when a person from the same Rinse Kingdom was hard to influence, the person this time was Pershion Kingdom’s prince.

‘But even so, I don’t want to leave him to die……’

Various plans brushed through within his head.

Roan soon bit his lips.

‘Even if I remember all sorts of events, accidents, wars, battles, and people, in truth, there are too many things that I’m missing.’

He had completely forgotten about such big events and accidents, incredible people, and wondrous treasures that he wondered just how he had forgotten about these things.

But that was just how memories were.

If he didn’t pay attention, they slowly sank beneath the surface.

It was the same with the memories of Manus Pershion.

Even though he definitely and clearly remembered who he was, he was completely unaware of him until he had heard Chris’ story.

‘If it wasn’t for Chris, I probably would have only realized it after he had died.’

He was careless.

Because he had only used necessarily memories based on the situations at hand, but in reality he had let the important things pass by.

‘I should pick a day sometime and organize the important memories.’

Roan pushed aside the distracting thoughts within his head and turned to Chris.

“How long would it take for the results of the war to spread?”

“It will take at least ten days.”

Including the Rinse Kingdom, all the kingdoms on the continent still weren’t officially using intelligence organizations.

Instead, they utilized the method of border guards taking the news from the outside and reporting through regular soldiers.

Due to that, the quality of the information itself was low and the speed of the report was also significantly slow.

Although couriers, messenger riders, and information agencies were occasionally used, they weren’t comparable to Agens, which already had systematic structure and skilled agents.

‘Hhm. Ten days……’

It was neither long nor short amount of time.

‘I have to set an advantageous field before that.’

And a field that stands out by itself wasn’t good.

It must fit well with the plans that Roan had already set up.

‘Hmm.’

It was difficult.

There was a limit from working alone.

‘I should talk with Clay about it.’

If it’s Clay, he should be able to come up with an excellent scheme or an unusual plan.

Roan organized his thoughts and then gave Chris a new order.

“For now, investigate Prince Manus Pershion and the Pershion Kingdom. Don’t overdo it too much either.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Chris slightly lowered his head.

“Then, should we go meet the young merchants?”

“Yes. They are waiting in the reception room.”

Chris nodded his head as he stood up.

While exchanging stories about the Pershion Kingdom, the two left the office.

Kuung.

The door closed and Roan and Chris disappeared from sight.

A bird that was sitting on the windowsill, as if it was waiting, flapped and flew out.

*****

Lidia of the lumber business and Eska of the restaurant business were much more younger and brilliant women than what Roan had thought.

As expected of the individuals who Chris chose, they were daring and overflowing with confidence.

But that didn’t mean that they weren’t courteous.

Lidia and Eska, in their conversation with Roan, meticulously asked back all the crucial questions and answers.

Until sundown, the questions and answers continued on.

And finally.

“Lidia Lumber Co. will follow Sir Baron Tale.”

“Eska Restaurant will follow Sir Baron Tale.”

The two people decided to attempt a grand business with the continent as their customers.

They had accepted Roan’s offer.

Roan then took out an enormous amount of supply and investment funds on the spot and greatly rejoiced.

And at the same time, he made an organization called Tale Commerce Division and took Lidio Lumber Co., Eska Restaurant, and Ford Mining Co. under it.

‘Here, the Sale Company will take on the transportation business, and……’

Once he purchase the Istel Kingdom’s cheap farmlands with the newly prepared finances, he should be able to obtain a solid economic base.

‘I need to create a new company and send it to the Istel Kingdom. By now, all sort of farmlands will be on sale at dirt-cheap p……’

When his thoughts had reached that point, Roan suddenly opened his eyes wide.

‘Istel Kingdom and Pershion Kingdom……’

Suddenly, a method to create an advantageous field while associating with the Pershion Kingdom appeared in his head.

Although it hasn’t taken complete shape yet, at least a rough and hazy outline came out.

‘I should call a meeting.’

Roan wasn’t a genius.

Especially on topics besides war and battle, he was no better than ordinary people.

However, he wasn’t embarrassed of asking and learning the things he lacked.

Roan proposed to meet someday later to Lidia and Eska and then immediately called a meeting.

Excluding Austin who was at the Elton fief, Hundred-man Commander Harrison, Brian, Clay as well as other prominent geniuses and several ten-man commanders attended the meeting.

For a while, the story of the Byron Kingdom, Istel Kingdom, and the Pershion Kingdom’s war continued.

“Hmm. Manus Pershion……”

“It seems an incredible person has appeared.”

All of them let out quiet exclamations.

Roan nodded his head.

“Right. He is an incredible person. But this isn’t the time to simply be awed.”

As soon as his words finished, Clay faintly smiled.

“You’re planning on bringing him to our side.”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. I plan to win over Prince Manus Pershion’s heart.”

Gulp.

All of them gulped with nervous expressions.

A baron from a commoner background who just entered the world of nobles planned to face a prince of a different nation.

It definitely won’t be easy, no it would be a really difficult work.

“For now, I’ll tell you the plan I have thought up.”

For a while, Roan laid out the plans that roughly set the framework.

Clay, as well as various others, nodded and shook their heads from time to time, and showed various responses.

The story that went on for a while finally ended.

“What do you think?”

Roan cautiously asked.

With quite serious faces, the people pondered for a moment and then slightly nodded their heads.

“It doesn’t sound too bad.”

“But the current state is too sketchy.”

Roan wordlessly nodded his head.

That was something he also agreed on.

At that moment, Clay, who had been deep in contemplation, cheerfully smiled and opened his mouth.

“I have supplemented my lord’s plan with few things, would you be willing to hear it?”

And following that, a meticulous and solid scheme was calmly laid out.

The more Clay’s story continued on, the people showed greatly shocked expressions.

‘He made all that up just like that on the spot?’

‘It’s a perfect scheme as if he had known and prepared beforehand.’

The story Clay laid out was just that incredible.

Even Roan, who usually hid his expressions well, couldn’t hide the surprise on his face.

‘Incredible.’

A sincere astonishment.

Beyond his nature and values, he had to at least admit Clay’s talent.

“How does it sound?”

Clay, who had finished his story, carefully asked.

Roan gazed at the people within the meeting room.

Every time they met his eyes, they lightly nodded their heads.

They all approved of Clay’s scheme.

Roan inhaled deeply and look straight into Clay’s eyes.

“Alright. Prepare it fully.”

“Yes. Please leave it to me.”

Clay slightly lowered his head and clenched his fist.

‘It’s a chance.’

From the merits he raised in the rebellion suppression before, his office was raised from supply administrator to the chief administrator.

However, Clay couldn’t be satisfied with the current state.

He wanted to go up to at least the Chief troop administrator or an administrator position that presided and administered over the entire administration of the fief.

‘Of course, that also isn’t my final goal, but……’

An even higher place, an even higher position, an even higher power.

Clay’s goal was at a much higher place.

‘Thanks to a lark passing me the good news, it seems I had grabbed a fine chance.’

A peculiar smile hung from his mouth.

*****

“Manus Pershion?”

Simon creased his brows.

It was because the news Roan had brought was simply too shocking.

‘Even the news that Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom allying together and attacked the Pershion Kingdom is an incredible thing, but……’

The Pershion Kingdom won instead thanks to Manus’ actions?

It was something hard to believe.

“Have you ever heard rumors about Pershion Kingdom’s second prince?”

At Simon’s words, Viscount Tio Ruin searched through his old memories and replied.

“Although I have heard that he was bright from the young age, it wasn’t to a point of being special. Instead, the First Prince Reitas is known to be a very outstanding prince.”

“Right. I had also heard rumors of Reitas.”

Simon, as well as numerous nobles, nodded their heads.

That was also the same for Roan.

‘If it’s Reitas, he is Pershion Kingdom’s next monarch. He was a brave and brilliant king. But he too……’

Lived shortly.

He had suffered from an unknown disease and then left the world at the age of forty.

Subsequently, the Pershion Kingdom was divided into four smaller nations.

The story after that was unknown.

‘Since I also died not too long after that.’

The inside of his mouth somehow felt bitter.

‘Anyhow, for the two brothers to have died from diseases. The fate of Pershion’s royalty is quite trag……?!’

When his thoughts arrived at that point, it felt as if lightning bolted through his head.

‘Perhaps?’

A one frightening theory rose in his head.

‘Were they not natural deaths by diseases?’

No doubt it was simply conjecture, but the probability of such was also enough.

One of the biggest differences between the last life and this life was the point that the royalty seen from afar and from close up were greatly different.

‘Possibly, the place more vicious than the battlefield may be the palace right here.’

The place teeming with those who wanted to be the king and those who wanted to make them king.

‘If the Pershion royalty isn’t very different from here, there is a high chance that secret strife had happened over the competition for the succession for the throne. But who had diseased those tw……’

When his thoughts had continued on to that point, he heard Simon’s voice.

“Baron Tale. So are you saying that you’ll go meet him, Manus Pershion?”

“Ah…… ah, yes. Before the news reaches the other princes, I believe that it would be good to approach from our side first.”

Roan quickly cleaned up his complicated thoughts and lowered his head.

While rubbing the tip of his chin with one hand, Simon submerged himself in contemplation.

“Hhm.”

It wasn’t a bad proposal.

But it also wasn’t especially that attractive.

“The Pershion Kingdom is located far away from our Rinse Kingdom. Is there any special need to hold hands with such a far away country?”

Roan raised his head and looked at Simon.

The light in his eyes was serene.

With a composed voice, Roan answered.

“Between our Rinse Kingdom and the Pershion Kingdom, there is the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom. Originally, it is the basics of strategy to befriend a faraway nation and attack the countries that are closer.”

Simon nodded his head.

“Right. Those words certainly aren’t wrong. But wouldn’t the king of the first prince be better if we are to befriend the nation?”

“That is……”

Roan momentarily hesitated his words.

If possible, he felt like revealing everything he knew of the future events.

‘In the last life, the current king, Ave Von Pershion, announced the First Prince Reitas as the king right after Manus died next year, then stepped back as a backroom old man. If the same things were to happen in this life, it isn’t really a good choice to line up behind the king.’

But the First Prince Reitas also wasn’t a good choice.

Simon also knew of that reason.

Roan organized the thoughts within his head and replied.

“The Pershion Kingdom’s King Ave Von Pershion is an extremely incompetent person. Furthermore, he is a corrupted king who frequents extravagance and pleasure as daily work. Lining up with an individual like this isn’t a very good choice.”

It was true to a certain degree.

Rather than looking after politics and administration, he was rapt over wine, women, and gambling.

One of the reasons the Byron Kingdom attacked the Pershion Kingdom was actually Ave’s incompetence.

In fact, even the Pershion Kingdom’s citizens found it amazing how great sons like Reitas and Manus were born from that dog-like Ave. 1

Roan continued to speak.

“In the case of First Prince Reitas Pershion, I’m sure that sir knows why he isn’t such a good choice.”

Immediately after Roan finished his words, Simon spoke in a gruff voice.

“He’s an intimate friend with Kallum.”

The Rinse Kingdom’s Third Prince Kallum Rinse and the Pershion Kingdom’s First Prince Reitas Pershion were buddies who had studied together.

When the continent’s sage Pienes called together the princes of each nation and taught them, they had befriended each other while studying together and were known to have continuously exchanged letters.

Simon exhaled a short sigh.

“In the end, befriending Manus is the inevitable choice.”

At those words, Roan shook his head.

“That isn’t so. I can assert that this will be the best choice to make.”

“Best…… how could you be so sure?”

Simon, whose information on Manus was completely nonexistent, asked back with a somewhat doubtful look.

Instead of an answer, Roan quietly stared into Simon’s eyes.

His eyes were full of certainty.

Simon looked into those eyes then soon nodded his head.

“Good.”

The tips of his mouth slightly rose.

“Baron Tale. Do as you wish.”

The permission was finally given.

Roan deeply bowed his head.

“Thank you very much, sir.”

Roan’s trip to the Pershion Kingdom was decided just like that.

The meeting between Manus Pershion, the man who had received too much of God’s love and left the world too early, and Roan, who had once again gained a chance at life for an unknown reason.

The two people, who had obvious and distinctly different lives, were going to meet.

At least at that point in time, Roan completely hadn’t expect what kind of event will happen to him.

Triumphant Return (4) End.

the author plays around with the proverb 호부견자, which translates word for word tiger-father-dog-son and means bad sons born from great father, and calls Reitas and Manus 호자, meaning tiger-son or great sons, and calls Ave 견부, meaning dog-father and bad father. The funny thing is that this play doesn’t seemed to be considered actual Korean by the dictionary. ↩

Chapter 136




T/n (CSV): 1/3 chapter (May 30th’s chapter) for the week.

Note: Tale Troop has been changed to Tale Legion.

Update: Next chapter will be a bit late, probably up tomorrow morning when editing is done.

Roan hurried his preparations to leave.

But that didn’t mean that he was simply leaving straight to the Pershion Kingdom.

First, he had to go back to the Tale Barony along with the newly born Tale Legion.

‘I must make all the preparations at there.’

It would be troublesome if Second Prince Tommy Rinse or Third Prince Kallum Rinse’s factions become suspicious of his actions.

Due to that, each and every action of his was careful.

Then.

“My lord. You have a guest.”

Onil’s voice, who was managing the temporary mansion, was heard.

Faintly smiling, he continued to speak.

“It’s Princess Aily.”

Tuk.

The hands, which were moving busily to clean up the office, abruptly stopped.

Brushing off the dust on his clothes, Roan walked towards the door.

“Where is she?”

“She is in the mansion’s garden.”

“Why not guide her to the reception room?”

“That place is also still being cleaned up, so it is quite dusty.”

Roan nodded slowly at Onil’s words.

His feet kept moving faster.

Onil glanced at that sight, and then stepped back and lowered his head.

Not noticing him at all, Roan hurriedly headed towards the mansion’s garden.

“Ah……”

A quiet exclamation naturally came out.

At a shade canopy located at one side of the garden.

Princess Aily Rinse was underneath it.

She, in a plain dress, looked so graceful and relaxed that only the time around her seemed to flow slowly.

“Princess.”

“Ah, Sir Baron Tale.”

Meeting each other’s eyes, the two bowed their heads.

Roan, with a soft voice, politely asked.

“What bring you all the way here?”

Aily showed a cheerful smile that those words as she replied.

“I heard that you’ll be leaving soon. So I came to say goodbye.”

“Ah…… thank you very much.”

Roan unknowingly let out a quiet exclamation.

‘Leaving……’

He was simply so busy that he hadn’t had such thought.

No, instead of leaving he had thought of it as ‘returning’ to the Tale Barony.

But.

‘Leaving is right. At least in this situation……’

Leaving and returning.

The feelings the two words gave were too different.

Roan wordlessly stared into Aily’s eyes.

Lights holding unexplainable feelings met and flowed between their eyes.

‘Ah……’

Aily soon shyly smiled and slightly lowered her head.

“I pray that only good things will happen to you from now on.”

Roan nodded his head and replied.

“I too will pray that princess will only be happy.”

At those words, Aily snickered and hid her small red lips with her right hand.

“It’s as if we’re people saying their last farewells.”

“Is it?”

Roan asked back as he cheerfully smiled

Then, after hesitating for a moment, he carefully continued his words.

“I will make sure to come visit once if I come back to Miller.”

“Yes. I’ll be waiting.”

Aily immediately answered but then promptly redden her face with a thoroughly surprised look.

‘What do you mean I’ll be waiting?’

Her heart loudly jumped.

Roan, as he watched her, unconsciously made a bright smile.

Courage appeared in his heart.

“And if you are fine with it, please come visit the Tale Baro……”

When he had spoke to that point.

“My lord.”

He heard confident voice.

A truly familiar voice to the ears.

It was Clay.

“Hm.”

Roan couldn’t quite finish his words and turned his head to look at Clay.

Clay first greeted towards Aily and then looked at Roan.

“The preparations are complete.”

It was a report that the preparations to head towards the Tale Barony were finished.

“Okay. I got it.”

Roan lightly nodded his head.

Clay looked back and forth between Roan and Aily for a moment, and then went out of the garden after giving a respectful farewell.

“Is that person perhaps Clay?”

With a cautious voice, Aily asked.

In the capital, Miller, Roan’s subordinates also spread their fame as much as Roan.

Especially his adjutant Austin; Harrison; Brian, who was the kingdom’s swordsman who received high expectations; and Clay, who joined a bit late but showed outstanding and excelling schemes and unique plans, were notably famous.

Roan looked towards the direction Clay disappeared to and nodded.

“Yes. He is.”

At those words, Aily wavered with a slightly hesitant look then carefully spoke with a quiet voice.

“Although it’s true that he is a person with outstanding talent…… please don’t give him all of sir Baron’s trust.”

“What do you mea……?”

As Roan hesitated his words, Aily formed a bitter smile.

“To me, Clay’s heart can’t be seen. I can’t tell whether its inside is black, or white. This kind of case is…”

Her expression slightly turned stiff.

“A first.”

“Hmm.”

Roan leaked a short groan.

He could more or less notice what Aily was trying to say.

‘Don’t trust him too much, is it……’

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Princess’s words, I’ll bear it in mind.”

Aily wordlessly lowered her head.

‘Clay. A person whose heart couldn’t be seen……’

Her eyes for looking at people were indisputable.

That wasn’t a sort of instinct.

‘It’s the first time I’ve experienced this since I earned this power.’

Her heart felt heavy.

Aily held her small hands evenly together and deeply inhaled.

‘There is a need to keep watch. Some kind of problem may happen to Sir Baron Tale.’

A foreboding thought filled her head.

Her heart felt even heavier.

Then.

“Thank you for worrying about me.”

She heard Roan’s voice.

Suddenly, the oppressing feelings that filled her head and heart disappeared as if it was a lie.

“Huu.”

A sigh of relief pushed through her small red lips and flew out shortly.

There was a strange power in Roan’s voice.

The kind that relaxed people’s hearts and make them happy.

Aily didn’t know it yet, of course, but that was something that only applied to her.

For a while, Roan and Aily stared at each other without saying any words.

No, there was no need to speak.

The two’s feelings were passed to each other as if they were absorbed.

Like that, Roan and Aily promised of the next time and parted.

Roan prepared meticulously for one more day, and headed towards the Tale Barony as soon as the sky brightened.

Simon and the nobles who follow him came out to the mansion to see him off.

But the thing that made Roan happier than anything else were the castle’s residents who were lined up following the street and all the way out of the gate.

They, to Roan who looked after them all the while staying in the capital unlike the other nobles, held strong feelings of gratitude and respect.

Until Roan and the Tale Legion’s soldiers couldn’t be seen, the castle’s citizens clapped and cheered at them.

From the north that they left, a cold wind blew.

A chilly northern wind.

The season was now entering winter.

*****

In the middle of the mountains that neither the moonlight nor the light of the stars reached.

Pdduk!

A small bird somehow flew around between the trees.

A moment later.

Kiig!

The small bird sat down on the tree that just began to grow and let out a sharp cry.

An inky black space where not even a single presence could be felt.

At that moment, a small torch appeared and pushed aside the darkness of the space.

“A message bird at this time.”

The message bird denoted the birds that personally passed words instead of letters or objects.

As an extremely special bird, it was hard for most people to see nor use without permission.

A rough and wild looking man soon appeared beneath the torch.

Extending his right hand towards the bird, he murmured unintelligible words.

Kiig! Kig! Kigigigik!

Then, the small bird went up on top of the man’s palm and, as if it was telling a story, chattered without a pause.

The cries of the bird shattered the silence in the middle of the mountain.

“Hmm.”

The man let out a quiet groan.

The story the message bird had passed was considerably surprising.

“There isn’t a need to hide anymore?”

He creased his brows and contemplated for a moment, then lightly shook his head.

Kig!

The small bird left behind a short cry and flew higher and higher into the night sky.

The man quietly whispered as he chased that sight with his eyes.

“It looks like he sent message birds to all the places that are reachable.”

Probably by now, the message birds should have arrived at the friends, the kinds, and the brothers who were living and hiding in deep places all over the world.

Although that number wouldn’t be very great even so.

The man shook and unlit the torch, then murmured with a quiet voice.

“Tale Barony, is it…… should I try going there once?”

His voice was hesitant.

It was simply that difficult of a decision to make.

“Well, there’s still time.”

According to the story the message bird passed, there was still a plenty of time left.

The man slowly hid his body into the darkness.

Silence once again covered the mountain.

*****

In the Tale Barony, there still was no lord’s castle nor any proper castle.

Although the Mediasis village, which was the center of administration and politics, had a significantly large size, it only had a false wall built with trees stacked high instead of a solid wall.

“Once the lord comes back, we should raise the lord’s castle and the castle walls first.”

Hundred-Man Commander Semi, who was administering the entire barony’s public order after Roan left for the capital, Miller, looked at the shoddy false walls and shook his head.

“We should also build forts at the strategic points.”

“And repair the streets.”

“The training ground should also be expanded.”

The hundred-man commanders and ten-man commanders all chipped in a word.

“Come to think of bit, the training ground raised quite excellent results despite being so small.”

“You’re right. All of them became dashing regulars.”

The hundred-man commanders spoke praises and looked at one young man.

“It’s all thanks to the new recruits, who worked diligently.”

The young man bashfully smiling and being humble was, in fact, Glenn.

In the last several months, he, who was appointed as the supervisor of the training ground, had given it his all to train the newbies.

Thanks to that, the greenhorns, who used to be no more than a mere mob, were able to be reborn as regulars.

As the result, the Amaranth troop that was left in the Mediasis Village was able to achieve grand results in both quantity and quality.

“When the lord sees this, he should be so surprised, right?”

Numerous hundred-man commanders nodded at Semi’s words.

They turned towards the long and straight street that stretched inside the village.

On the street, magnificent soldiers were filed up one after another.

And behind the soldiers, the people of the Mediasis Village and nearby villages had came out and waited for Roan.

It was an incredible crowd of people.

“It should be about time for the lord to arrive……”

Semi looked towards the village’s western entrance and scrunched his nose.

At that moment.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

The watchtower’s bell noisily rang.

Finally, Roan and the Amaranth Troop had appeared at the end of the western field.

Suddenly, a strange heat circled the entire village.

That heat brought blazing lava to mind.

It was sense of an incredible energy that seemed like it’ll immediately explode being condensed.

The Amaranth troop including Semi as well as the ordinary villagers all held back the heat within their chests and watched the western entrance.

And finally.

Flap!

TaleLegion.

The lead carrying the legion flag entered the village.

Amaranth Troop.

Roan Tale.

And following that, the troop flag and the commander’s flag shined their brilliance.

And right behind that.

The person that they’ve been waiting for so much finally showed himself.

Roan Tale.

Riding on a robust war horse, he appeared with a regal look.

Instantly.

“Waaaaaaah!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

“Tale Legion! Tale Legion!”

Cheers poured out.

The heat that was held in their chests exploded out at once.

It was to the degree that bodies would stagger from the vigor.

Roan brightly smiled as he raised his right hand.

‘I have come back.’

A fresh feeling of pride and longing stormed.

It was also the same for the Amaranth Troop’s soldiers who came back from the capital, Miller, following Roan.

“Has everyone been well?”

“I’m back!”

“Have you heard the news about us?”

Towards the soldiers that lined the sides of the street, they shouted and waved.

On their face were obvious looks of bottomless delight.

Meanwhile, the soldiers who became a part of the Tale Legion after the rebellion suppression made bewildered faces at the incredible welcome.

‘Just what……’

‘The popularity is amazing.’

‘To think commoners would like a noble this much.’

It was something hard to imagine in other places.

Feeling a sense of pride that appeared for no reason, they raised their heads that they had momentarily lowered up high.

‘I’m no longer a rebel. I’m a Tale Legion soldier.’

‘I’ll bury my bones here!’

The courage in their hearts soared.

Their shoulders opened up on their own and strength was put into their steps.

Slowly but truly confidently, the procession continued.

‘Glenn has done well.’

Roan looked at the soldiers that formed long lines on the either sides of the street and faintly smiled.

Their postures were straight and the light in their eyes was good.

Although there probably were areas that were lacking compared to the established Amaranth troop, with a bit of work, they would be able to become the strongest regulars in the surrounding region.

“My lord!”

When he arrived at the end of the street, the hundred-man commanders,including Semi, as well as the ten-man commanders neatly lined up and saluted.

Roan dismounted from the horse and walked towards Semi.

“All of you have excellently carried out the jobs you were assigned.”

“We have simply given our best.”

Semi answered as their representative.

He looked straight into Roan’s eyes and continued his words.

“We have heard the news through Agens’ agents. We truly congratulate you.”

“Congratulations!”

The other soldiers soon followed and shouted at the top of their lungs.

Roan cheerfully smiled and nodded.

“Because you guys were here, I was able to do the things I had to do with ease. All of you have done well.”

At those words, Semi and the numerous hundred-man commanders showed greatly moved expressions.

Recognition.

They had received Roan’s recognition.

Although merit evaluation and awards were good, there was nothing that felt better than to be recognized for their abilities and hard work by their lord.

“Waaaaa!”

“Welcome back, sir!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

Listening to the cheers that still continued to fall down, Roan lightly closed his eyes.

A tender feeling wrapped his entire body.

A familiar and longed for feeling.

With his eyes still closed, he quietly whispered.

“Yes. This here is my home.”

To Pershion Kingdom (1) End.

Chapter 137




T/n (CSV): 2nd regular chapter for the week.

Note: “Neperu Village” from ch. 128 has been edited to “Nuperu Village” for better pronounciation

Thankfully, numerous empty houses were prepared in Mediasis Village and the nearby lands.

This was thanks to the engineers who had tirelessly constructed houses and buildings even while Roan was away at the capital, Miller.

The soldiers who had followed Roan and newly moved to the Tale Barony were able to arrange residences without any trouble.

This, to them, was a great and new kind of shock.

The houses that they were newly distributed to them were several times cleaner and better houses than what they used to live in.

Once again, they decided to bury their bones in the Tale Barony for Roan and for themselves.

While the house distribution and the legion organization went on, Roan checked all sorts of reports and documents that were piled up and solved the problems concerning security and administration immediately on the spot.

And while that went on, Chris came back to the fief together with the three merchants of the Tale Commerce Division, and after that, Austin, who was guarding the Elton fief, returned with a portion of that region’s residents.

Finally, the member’s of Roan’s house, family, brothers, and comrades all returned home. 1

Although there wasn’t much time, that didn’t mean that he could suddenly leave to the Pershion Kingdom.

Before that, there were preparations and works that needed to be done.

Amongst them, the very first was the Tale Legion’s official inauguration, troop restructure, administration of groups and appointments for officers.

“We officially inaugurate the Tale Legion with fifteen thousand strong as a basis.”

The inauguration and the appointment ceremony was immediately prepared.

For the commander of the legion, Roan, a Baron of the Rinse Kingdom and the lord of the Tale Barony, was appointed.

For the vice commanders, Austin and Semi were appointed and were each promoted to three-thousand-man commanders.

Along with the two people, parts of the original hundred-man commanders were promoted to thousand-man commanders and Roan had separately reformed the Amaranth Troop as his direct troop.

“Austin. I appoint you as the Tale Legion’s vice commander as well as three-thousand-man commander, and confer the name Piedes as the troop name.”

“I swear my loyalty to my lord!”

Austin kneeled down on one knee and received the command baton with two hands from Roan.

He, with his head down deeply, shed tears.

‘I’m a vice commander……’

The days of the past rose in his mind.

The day he was integrated into Roan’s newly made squad when he was living as a common soldier who was unable to even become a squad commander.

The days he roamed the harsh and bleak battlefield with Roan.

In the end, he had came up all the way to this place, and that insignificant spearman become a vice-commander of a barony.

“Austin. I look forward to continue working with you.”

Roan grabbed Austin’s shoulder.

“Huuhuhuhuhk.” 2

In the end, Austin couldn’t hold himself back and cried.

The soldiers, lined up below the stage, each rubbed the eyes that became hot with the back of their hands.

Roan’s heart also trembled from catharsis, but he exerted a smile and took a deep breath.

Austin hung the baton on his belt and went back to his place.

Following that, it was Semi’s turn.

“Semi. I appoint you as the Tale Legion’s vice commander as well as three-thousand-man commander, and confer the name Impasse as the troop name.”

“I swear my loyalty to my lord!”

Semi also got down on one knee and received the command baton with two hands from Roan.

He too couldn’t stop the emotions that welled up.

As even Semi, who was rugged and stout, shed tears, the appointment ceremony hall soon turned into a sea of tears.

But they were certainly not sad and sorrowful cries.

They were cries of joy and tears of happiness shed by those who achieved their desires through adversity and hardship.

“I look forward to continue working with you.”

Roan’s voice broke through the sound of weeping and filled the appointment ceremony hall.

Even after that, cries broke out every time thousand-man commanders and hundred-man commanders were appointed.

But only one person, Clay, brightly smiled and savored his happiness when he was appointed as the administrative manager that overlooked the entire fief’s management.

Like that, the appointment ceremony ended.

A total of one hundred and fifty hundred-man commanders, fifteen thousand-man commanders, and two three-thousand-man commanders were appointed.

Besides this, people like Clay and Onil, who showed their excellence in administration, finance, management and such, each received ranks and positions befitting their abilities to pursue perfection in the fief’s management that had been rather lax.

Roan stood on top of the stage and gazed at the soldiers who were lined up.

Although everyone’s tears had stopped, their eyes and cheeks were flushed red.

“All of you did well up until this point.”

His voice was calm.

“But this isn’t the end. There is still much more to the path we must go, and we do not know whether that path will be much more perilous and difficult than the one we’ve walked until now.”

Bit by bit, his voice became stronger.

Gulp.

Fifteen thousands soldiers unconsciously gulped.

Roan stared straight at them and continued his words.

“You only need to trust me and follow as you’ve done until now. I too, as I’ve done until now……”

His voice turned smaller once again.

But the voice filled with passion and sincerity was burning hot instead.

“Will trust you and step forwards.”

The moment his words finished, cheers and roars exploded out.

“Waaaaah!”

“Long live Roan Tale!”

“Long live the Tale Barony!”

“Long live the Tale Legion!”

Sounds of cheers echoed throughout the land and the sky.

In the start of the winter when the cold northern wind blew.

The Tale Barony was born anew.

*****

The meetings, which were ran without any differentiation between regular, emergency, and military meetings, were also reorganized based on their purposes after the appointment ceremony.

The hundred-man commanders, who had attended the meetings every time, were changed to attending only in the military meetings.

Due to that, when Roan had opened a special meeting concerning the trip to the Pershion Kingdom, the attendees were limited to the three-thousand-man commanders Austin and Semi, captains of the Amaranth troop and thousand-man commanders Harrison and Brian, the administrator Clay, the president of Agens Chris, and the vice-captain of Tenebra troop Keep.

“First, we need to create a company through the Tale Commerce Division that could purchase and run the Istel Kingdom’s farmlands.”

Everyone nodded at Clay’s words.

His words continued on.

“Once the company is formed, the four of us, the lord, thousand-man commander Harrison, thousand-man commander Brian, and I, will disguise as merchants and head towards the Istel Kingdom.”

Clay pointed at the map on the table.

“Currently, the Istel Kingdom is suffering from an extreme shortage of food. Due to that, it is much easier for grain merchants to cross the borders compared to other merchants. It is to a point that even us, Rinse Kingdom’s people, who they aren’t very amicable with, can cross the borders with ease.”

This was the truth.

Roan, Clay, and the others planned to use this very point.

“After that, as I had presented before……”

Clay calmly explained the plans that were fortified and constructed even stronger in the last few days.

All of them nodded their heads without any special reactions.

It was plan that was that difficult to find any faults in.

Roan, after hearing the entire plan, gazed at everyone’s faces and cautiously opened his mouth.

“If things go according to the plan, we should be able to return to the fief in two months. Until then, Austin, Semi, and Chris will work together to run the fief.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Austin and the others answered in one voice.

Roan inhaled deeply.

“Good. Then immediately create the grain company.”

Everyone slightly nodded their heads and moved to carry out the works they were each assigned.

At that moment, Chris asked with a careful voice.

“What should we name the company?”

Although it didn’t seem like something special, it was quite an important problem.

All of them turned towards Roan.

Roan thought for a moment, then brightly smiled and gave a short answer.

“Let’s go with Charity Trust.”

“Ah……”

With a quiet exclamation, Chris nodded his head.

Charity Trust.

It was a name that somehow felt just right at the heart.

*****

Charity Trust’s founding was taken charged and proceeded by Chris.

He, with the help of the three young merchants Lidia, Eska, and Ford, created a grain company of a rather large scale.

The role of the owner was decided to be temporarily managed by Eska, who ran the restaurant business, and Clay was appointed as the head of the caravan that would manage the group until the Istel Kingdom.

Once the company was founded, Clay went around the Lancephil County and the surrounding regions and purchased an incredible amount of grains.

Meanwhile, Chris went around the Tale Barony as well as the Lancephil County and the surrounding fiefs and was issued the license for the company and the permit to cross the borders.

And on top of this, he let loose the agents and spread the rumor that the Charity Trust was originally a company with a significantly long history.

Thanks to that, it became impossible for the Istel Kingdom to grasp the Charity Trust’s authenticity even if it were to suspect it.

And when Roan was completely focusing on preparing to cross the border, the news of the Byron Kingdom, the Istel Kingdom, and the Pershion Kingdom’s war reached the capital, Miller.

The capital, Miller, literally became a scene of chaos.

Even though the news that the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom allied to attack the Pershion Kingdom was shocking, at the news that they were instead completely defeated, the capital was flabbergasted.

These reactions, however, calmed down faster than expected, and the reason for such was the three princes, Simon, Tommy, and Kallum, had turned people’s attention towards someplace else.

Simon had the need to turn people’s attention to someplace else so that Roan could safely enter the Pershion Kingdom, and in the case of Third Prince Kallum, he didn’t want to turn people’s eyes and ears on him since he was friends with a Pershion Prince.

But it was unknown why Tommy tried to cover up the news and turned the attention elsewhere.

Anyhow, these reactions and news of the capital were, through Keep’s Tenebra Troop members, passed directly to Roan.

‘This is why politics is difficult.’

As they each held each other back, nothing significant happened in reality.

But even if it was so, he couldn’t waste time.

“We leave for the Istel Kingdom in four days.”

Finally, the order had came.

For this, Roan led the Amaranth troop and headed towards Nuperu Village located at the edge of Poskein Lake.

Nuperu Village was where the Amaranth Navy was located at, and this trip was to fool people’s eyes.

Here, Roan, Harrison, and Brian schemed to pretend subjugating Poskein Lake with the Amaranth troop.

And in reality, they planned to disguise as merchants and cross over to the Istel Kingdom after joining up with the Charity Trust.

If the plan succeeded, people wouldn’t form any particular suspicion even if Roan couldn’t be seen for a while.

“My lord. Please be careful.”

Daiv bowed deeply at the waist with a worried look.

Roan, on the other hand, cheerfully smiled and nodded.

“Daiv. I plan to subjugate the Poskein Lake the moment I come back. Make sure to finish the preparations by then.”

“Yes. Please don’t worry.”

Daiv answered with a voice full of confidence.

Because they had to pretend Roan was subjugating Poskein Lake either way, they had to constantly lead the fleet and roam Poskein Lake without a pause.

In that process, the sailors’ skills in building as well as steering ships would grow significantly.

“Please worry only about your own health, my lord.”

Daiv once again deeply bowed.

Seeing off by Daiv, Roan left the Tale Barony together with Harrison and Brian.

Their destination was Lancephil County’s easternmost region.

There, the Charity Trust was already standing by with a humongous amount of grains.

On the fourth day of walking day and night.

Roan was finally able to rendezvous with the Charity Trust.

“Thank you very much for your work.”

Clay, in a clean attire, lowered his head.

He, as the head of the caravan managing the band, didn’t wear shabby clothes like Roan, Harrison, and Brian.

Roan nodded while smiling cheerfully.

“From now on, act befittingly as the head of the caravan. Since I too will act like a porter.”

Who knew when someone may be watching them from somewhere.

Clay faintly smiled and nodded.

“Yes. Please don’t worry.”

His smile became much deeper.

‘I’m confident at those things.’

He didn’t quite say those last words and swallowed them.

Roan, aware or perhaps unaware of Clay’s such thoughts, inhaled deeply.

“Then. Should we depart? Caravan head sir Roy.”

Roy meant Clay.

Clay nodded his head, then got on top of a wagon in the middle of the caravan.

“Let’s depart.”

When he ordered with a quiet voice, the entire caravan soon began to move.

Durguruk. Durguruk.

The carts carrying incredible amounts of grains extended on endlessly.

Like that, the journey continued on for two days.

The band now passed through the Rinse Kingdom’s border gate and was crossing the buffer zone.

“It’s the border gate!”

A loud voice was heard from the lead.

Suddenly, several merchants gulped with nervous expressions.

Roan, who had been walking alongside a wagon, saw that sight and faintly smiled.

“Don’t worry. Since we really are going to the Istel Kingdom to buy and sell grains.”

Of course, they did plan to do other things too, though.

“Yes. My lo…… no, I got it. Henry.”

A merchant carelessly spoke then quickly changed his words.

Henry was the name that Roan decided to use in this operation.

At that moment, the caravan, which had been tirelessly moving, finally stopped.

The lead of the caravan had reached the check point’s entrance.

Soon, unpleasant looking soldiers held spears and approached on either sides.

They gratuitously checked below the wagons, moved and searched through the grain bags, and glared their eyes.

Puuk!

Amongst them, there were some who poked at the bags with the tip of their spears.

Although bits of grains poured out, no one showed dissatisfaction.

If they weren’t careful, they could be nitpicked and get held up.

“There’s no problem with the goods.”

The soldiers who were inspecting the grain bags shouted aloud.

Then they soon approached where the bits of grains poured out, grabbed a handful, and put them in their pockets.

‘I heard that food shortage was serious, but it seems it’s more serious than I thought.’

Roan inwardly shook his head as he watched that sight.

Meanwhile, the gate captain Dose stood next to the wagon Clay was riding on and was checking the company license and permit to cross the border.

“Charity Trust?”

“Yes. That’s right.”

“I’ve been working at this gate for almost ten years but never heard of it.”

His eyes were suspicious.

But as if it was a question he already predict, Clay calmly replied.

“We originally did business at the Rinse Kingdom’s north.”

“And?”

At the words that asked again, Clay made an embarrassed look.

“It’s rather a bit to answer something like this, but because they said that selling grains in Istel Kingdom will make a big profit…… cough.”

At those words, Dose creased his brows but didn’t harrassed or bully them.

But he repeatedly checked the license and the permit that don’t really have much to see multiple times.

Clay, who had been watching, took out a small pouch from his chest pocket.

“Come to think of it, this is something we picked up while coming here, so please find its owner.”

“You picked it up?”

Dose slightly opened the pouch.

It was a pouch that evenly had gold and silver mixed in.

A bribe that was prepared beforehand.

Dose brightly smiled to a point of showing all his teeth and nodded his head.

“Good gracious, you’re quite a good natured fellow unlike the young ones these days. I’ll definitely make sure to find its owner.”

“Yes. I’ll trust sir captain. And……”

Clay pointlessly glanced left and right, then spoke in a quiet voice.

“I’ll live a small wagon behind, so please share with your subordinates.”

In the dreadful food shortage, tens of grain bags were an incredible bribe.

Dose’s mouth was now hung from his ears.

“Hhm? Cough. No well there’s really……”

Clay, with a smile still on his face, shook his head.

“No no. We will probably have to cross this gate a lot from now on, so we’re telling you beforehand since it looks like sir will be troubled each time because of us.”

“Good grace, you really are a good natured friend.”

Dose clenched his fist and drummed his chest.

“Don’t worry about crossing this gate from now on. I’ll especially take care of it.”

“Oh my. Thank you very much.”

Clay pointlessly fussed as he lowered his head.

Like that, the two shared a rot-smelling chat for a while.

And while that went on, a small pouch of money was passed on once more.

With a completely giddy face, Dose shouted aloud.

“Remove the wooden fences! The Charity Trust is passing!”

As soon as he spoke those words, the wooden fences that were blocking the gate were moved to the sides.

Clay abruptly poked his head out of the wagon and winked.

“Then, we’ll greet you again next time.”

“Yeah! Be careful and do come back!”

Dose brightly smiled as he waved his hand like seeing off an old friend.

Clay watched that sight for a long time, then soon disappeared himself into the wagon.

“Filthy bastard.”

The face that was brightly smiling until now completely disappeared into nothingness.

Clay clicked his tongue with a completely twisted face.

“Cht cht cht. It’s because of incompetent bastards who only tries to fill their stomachs like him that the ordinary citizens are starving to death.”

Although Clay did have the great desire to rise in the world and gain fame, his goal was also to create a rich and powerful nation that anyone can live well at the fundamental level.

Of course, it was a problem that his methods and process greatly differed from Roan.

‘Once I reach an even higher place, I will hunt down all those things and cut off its necks.’

Edification, enlightenment, and education were all not needed.

‘They’ll all act good if ruled with an iron fist.’

That was Clay’s thoughts.

Meanwhile, Roan, who was walking along with the wagons, was crossing the Istel Kingdom’s border gates much later.

Although the Istel Kingdom troops around him watched sharply, there was no one who recognized Roan.

Even though Roan had spread infamy as the Crimson Ghost, the people who knew that appearance were a small minority.

Furthermore, because even that rumor spread as having all red hair, eyebrows, and eyes, there was no one who could see the Roan of now and realize that he was the Crimson Ghost.

However.

“Hhm. It’s strange……”

A youthful looking young man with big eyes amongst the gate’s soldiers muttered in a quiet voice.

He was looking at Roan’s back that was slowly getting further away.

One of the soldier who were next to him tapped his shoulder and asked.

“What’s strange?”

At those words, the young man with the large eyes pointed at Roan’s back and answered.

“Over there. Doesn’t it look like the people around him are standing like they are escort him?”

“What? Escort?”

The soldier creased his brows and stared for a long while at the place the young man pointed at.

But he soon tilted his head.

“Well. I don’t get it at all.”

“Is it?”

The young man once again chased Roan’s back with his eyes.

But the caravan band had already went far away.

The soldier who was talking with the young man hit the back of the young man’s head.

“Oi, Pichio. That’s always your problem. I don’t know if it’s that your eyes are good or your instincts are good, but you’re looking at everything with suspicious eyes because of it.”

“But it really looked strange……”

The young man, Pichio, hesitated at the end of his words. ]

He was still chasing with his eyes the caravan band that couldn’t even be seen anymore.

‘I should check one more time when they come back the next time.’

Just in case he may forget about it, Pichio rolled the same words inside his mouth multiple times.

‘Charity Trust, Charity Trust, Charity Trust……’

A light glinted in the large eyes.

To Pershion Kingdom (2) End.

Chapter 138




T/n (CSV): 3nd and final regular chapter for the week.

Note: st8_lupe was busy this weekend, so our new editor Kajin edited this chapter.

‘Hmm.’

Roan swallowed back a groan as he stared at the scenery around him.

The Istel Kingdom was suffering from an even more grievous food shortage than he had thought.

Haggard and dried out corpses frequented the sides of the road that the caravan band was passing through, and the smell of death emanated heavily from the villages they sometimes stayed or passed by.

The Istel people pouncing up madly and begging for food whenever they saw the caravan was a frequent event, and the assaults by thieves and bandits continued endlessly.

‘The food shortage will continue until the autumn two years from now.’

Although the mysterious and sudden drop in the crop harvest would improve starting next year, it simply wasn’t possible for the Istel citizens’ situation to improve with just a single year’s worth of good farming.

‘Next year and the year after that. I have to create a footing in the Istel Kingdom by then.’

And that footing was the very purchasing of the Istel Kingdom’s farmlands, more specifically the long term leasing of the farms.

Currently, the Istel Kingdom’s farmers as well as nobles were putting out the farms, whose fertility had fallen as far down as it could go, as clearance goods.

However, there was no one in the Istel Kingdom that had the rooms to purchase them.

No, even if there was someone, there was no one who would purchase the useless lands that wouldn’t grow anything even if one planted the seeds.

In the end, the Istel Kingdom had reached a point where it allowed even foreigners to purchase the farms.

But, not as a complete sale but as a fifty-years long lease.

Its situation was desperate enough to fall to such means in order to secure a source of revenue.

But despite so, the number of people who stepped up to purchase the lands were a minority.

Even the outsiders believed that the Istel Kingdom’s lands were abandoned by, and cursed by a god.

‘We will lease those very lands wholesale.’

At the moment, the price had already fallen as far as it could fall.

Although others may sneer and point describing it as a foolish act, it mattered not to Roan.

It was because he knew that the fertility would rise once again starting next year.

At that moment.

“We can see Ceres Castle!”

The middle-aged man at the lead shouted aloud.

At the end of the extensive road, an awesome and grand castle appeared.

‘That is the very capital of the Istel Kingdom, Ceres.’

Roan unconsciously gulped.

Including both the last life and the current life, it was a place he was visiting for the first time.

The size of the Ceres Castle was stupendous.

It seemed to be multiple times greater than the Rinse Kingdom’s capital, Miller.

‘Since the Istel Kingdom’s national strength is originally much stronger than our kingdom.’

The Istel Kingdom was a rich and powerful nation that built its strength upon its astronomical grain yields.

Currently, even its national strength had become low as that crop yields fell.

Meanwhile, the caravan’s lead had reached the first sentries and came to a stop.

“You guys, are you grain merchants?”

The gaunt-looking sentries asked with slightly elated faces.

Clay opened the wagon’s door and answered while poking only his head out.

“Yes. We brought plenty of all kinds of grains.”

As soon as he spoke those words, the sentries waved their hands and shouted.

“Pass! The crop market is near the east gate!”

A hint of desperation could be felt from his voice.

Not anywhere else but the very capital’s inspection was relaxed like so.

It was a situation where even the capital’s sentries left the questions for later and passed if one was a grain merchant.

Clay lowered his head deeply to bow and then closed the wagon’s door.

“It’s the grain merchants!”

“Look at those bags!”

When they entered the castle, the residents flocked up like a swarm of bees.

But unlike other the people of other villages, they didn’t unwarrantedly touch the goods nor block the road.

They were simply elated from seeing the incredible number of grain bags.

“How, how much have you brought?”

“Is there more to come?”

They hoped that the grains would be spread plentiful enough so that the price of the food would fall.

Roan merely showed a bitter smile, unable to say any words.

‘Although the amount we brought is quite a lot, there’s no way that the price of food would drop because of it.’

There was the fact that the foods were simply too scarce, but the even greater reason was in fact the black market.

Currently, the Istel Kingdom was directly controlling and running the grain market to allocate and replenish the deficient grain supply.

At the same time, it was trading the grains at a fixed price to stop the price of the grains from exploding up.

To the merchants who were trying to leave an even bigger profit, this market management means by the Istel Kingdom weren’t attractive.

Due to that, black markets specializing in only grains appeared all over the kingdom.

This black market had brought an explosive inflation of grain prices, and by the time the grains passed through countless merchants and were sold to the citizens, an incredible price that no one could possibly purchase was attached.

Although the Istel Kingdom had labored extensively to curb the black markets, it couldn’t achieve any results due to the simply great number of markets and spontaneous opening and closing times.

Consequently, the price of the grains refused to fall below a certain price and continuously soared, and the ordinary citizens holding empty stomachs became the norm.

If Roan wanted to create a large profit, using the black market instead of the proper grain market was much more effective.

‘But we are using the proper grain market.’

To him, it was more important right now to leave an impression of the Charity Trust as a fair and trustworthy company than leaving behind a profit.

While thinking of this and that, the caravan band arrived at the grain market near the east gate.

“What may be the company’s name?”

A squalid looking manager glanced at the grain carts and asked.

With a cheerful smile, Clay showed the company license.

“It’s Charity Trust.”

The manager wrote down the name into a log, then waved his hand.

“Calculate the quantity!”

The moment he ordered, the market employees crowded around and began to count the number of grain bags.

While that went on, the market manager began talking with Clay and negotiated the price.

No, in truth it was merely negotiate in name, and was no more than simply announcing the predetermined price.

“Okay. Let us sell it at that price.”

Clay nodded his head without much contemplation.

“Yes? Ah, yes.”

The manager made a little surprised expression.

It was because he was the first merchant who sold the grains without any complaint.

“Okay. It’s good that the work could be done quickly.”

The manager quickly completed the document while smiling cheerily, and handed it to Clay.

It was because he was worried that he would perhaps change his mind.

Clay thoughtfully checked the document in his own way and signed at one side of the bottom corner.

Soon, the grain bags were moved from the wagons they brought to one side of the market.

“It’s quite more than I thought?”

“With this much, usually the merchants would sell it at the black market.”

The laborers whispered amongst themselves while hauling the bags.

Roan too chimed in enthusiastically while hauling the bags like them.

That was, from anyone’s eyes, look of a company laborer without a doubt.

Thanks to that, there was no one who suspected Roan.

Once the transaction was finished, the caravan group, including Roan and Clay, headed towards the outskirts of the capital.

They rented out an old inn a whole.

Because there was quite a large number of company members, it wasn’t something suspicious.

“Although we sold them at the proper grain market, we were left with a larger profit than we expected.”

“That must mean that the food situation is that bad.”

Roan made a bitter smile at Clay’s words and shook his head.

‘It looks like they raised the purchasing price of the grains since the food situation isn’t good and because of the black market, but…… although it was an unavoidable choice, the Treasury will soon reach the bottom if they continue buy up grains like this.’

Even without that, the Istel Kingdom was paying an incredible amount of war remuneration due to repeated wars and losses.

While Roan was thinking of various thoughts, Clay asked with a careful voice.

“My lord, must we really purchase the farmlands? Right now, the Istel Kingdom’s farmlands have completely lost their fertility and it’ll be fruitless regardless of what kind of crop seed we plant.”

Clay, who thought of himself as being smarter and more discerning than others, was very pessimistic of the work this time.

‘This is no different than just throwing away money.’

Buying the lands inside the Rinse Kingdom instead with the money earned from the grain trade would be much more effective.

Although they wouldn’t be able to buy a large amount since the price of the land was simply too expensive, at least the chance of crop failure was much lower.

Roan shook head head while smiling cheerfully.

“Don’t worry. My eyes are without fault. The Istel Kingdom’s farmlands will regain their fertility starting next year.”

His voice was full of certainty.

“If my lord says so, then it must be.”

“I simply follow my lord’s orders.”

Harrison and Brian didn’t hold questions anymore.

But.

“Hmm.”

A look of restlessness was still plain on Clay’s face.

He wanted to check for a clear evidence and reason.

But even so, he couldn’t just push and corner Roan.

“Since the price of the farms aren’t expensive, there won’t be a big loss even if a problem possibly arise.”

It was a comment with the failure in mind.

Roan faintly smiled and simply nodded his head.

“Sure, just think of it that way.”

At those words, Clay slightly lowered his head.

“Then, I will personally go out to purchase the farms starting tomorrow.”

“Please do.”

Roan lightly replied.

For four days starting tomorrow, it was scheduled for Clay to personally go purchase the farms.

After that, they would entrust the works to the real merchants who came with them, and Roan, Harrison, Brian and Clay planned to go over to the Pershion Kingdom after disguising their identities once more.

Roan looked around at everyone and spoke in a quiet voice.

“We are currently no different than in a hostile nation. All of you keep your heads straight and make sure not to make a mistake.”

“Yes, understood.”

All of them answered in one voice and lowered their heads.

Roan inhaled deeply as he looked at that sight.

‘Nothing special needs to happen……’

A small wish.

Perhaps because that wish had reached the sky, nothing special had actually happened to Roan and his group.

But at the place far away from them, 1

A strange crack was breaking apart in the Pershion Kingdom.

Although it wasn’t certain, it certainly was something special.

*****

Pershion Kingdom’s Capital Althus Castle.

The Althus Castle’s north gate was wide open and the inside of castle churned with an incredible wave of crowds.

On each sides of the newly maintained street, they lined up one after another and wore exhilarated faces.

At that moment.

Vvuuuuu!

With the sound of horns, a group of people appeared at an enormous triumphal arc at the end of the street.

The head of the group, the man on the snow-white horse, was a handsome young man overflowing of grace.

With a gentle smile on his face, he looked towards the north gate.

“Un? It’s the First Prince.”

“Prince Reitas has personally came out.”

Some of the castle’s residents recognised the young man and whispered.

The young man, he was in fact Reitas Pershion, famed as the First Prince of Pershion Kingdom and as a remarkably outstanding talent.

Originally, he was highly popular amongst the residents of the capital, Althus, and all the citizens of the kingdom.

Because the current king, Ave Von Pershion was simply so incompetent, the expectations for Reitas, who was outstanding in various ways, was unlike any others.

But.

“Anyway, when is Prince Manus coming?”

“It should soon be about time he arrive.”

“Kuu! To destroy the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom’s allied forces all by himself!”

“He’s really amazing!”

The castle’s residents soon turned their heads and stared at the north gate.

With completely elated faces, they fussed about.

The person the castle’s residents were waiting for was in fact Manus Pershion.

The saving hero of the kingdom, Manus had defeated the Byron Kingdom and Istel Kingdom’s allied army and was finally returning in triumph after reorganizing the border region.

The people’s eyes and interests were all headed towards Manus.

Reitas, who was standing in front of the triumphal arc, was already outside of their attention.

“Hmm.”

Reitas’ gentle smile slightly shook.

The tips of his eyes trembled sharply.

‘Manus……’

The little brother’s name stayed between his throat and the top of his mouth.

One side of his chest ached bitterly.

‘In the end, you have came out to the world.’

Something hot and large sat down in the middle of his chest.

A short wave appeared in his deep and calm eyes.

‘Although the people of the world holds me up as a talent or whatnot, but……’

Reitas knew.

That the real genius was his little brother Manus Pershion.

‘My beloved little brother, I have truly despaired when I couldn’t win against you with my talent.’

Reitas and Manus’ relationship was close.

Reitas cherished his little brother Manus and Manus followed his older brother Reitas well.

But as the two continued to grow, that relationship had twisted strangely.

Although Manus still looked up to Reitas and followed him, Reitas was slowing distancing himself from Manus.

He was afraid.

That he would be eaten alive by Manus’ unbelievable talent.

‘I had hoped that you would go on a journey or simply read a book without being interested in politics or power……’

Thankfully, Manus didn’t showed himself to the outside world as Reitas’ wish.

He had simply passed free and quiet days absorbed in reading and journeying that he enjoyed.

But the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom’s invasion had changed everything.

‘When everyone said to consent to the humiliating terms and end the war, you alone insisted on fighting against them.’

Although everyone had called it insane, Manus led a legion and marched alone, and perfectly defeated the enemy forces.

‘And then, you became the kingdom’s, the citizen’s hero.’

The presence-less Second Prince Manus spread his fame as the hero who saved the kingdom.

‘Hu.’

Reitas let out a short sigh.

‘My little brother, my beloved little brother. Just what should I do with you?’

If not careful, he could have the seat as the next king snatched away by Manus.

To such a degree, Manus’ fame was inconceivably great.

Reitas’ worries became deeper.

At that moment.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

With a bell sound, an enormous legion showed itself outside the castle gate.

Finally, Manus and the Manustima Legion he leads arrived.

Pershion Kingdom .

The flag of the kingdom entered the castle gate first.

Manustima Legion .

Manus Pershion .

The legion flag and the commander’s flag followed behind.

And finally.

“Waaaaaah!”

“Manus! Manus!”

“Manus Pershion! Manus Pershion!”

The saving hero of the kingdom, the Second Prince Manus Pershion appeared wearing a silver armor.

Although he looks similar to Reitas, he somehow exuded an impression of a mischief.

But his eyes were clear and deep, and a leisure and grace could be felt from his every movement of the hand and feet.

“Thank you everyone! Thank you for coming out like this!”

Manus brightly smiled as he waved at the castle’s citizens.

“Hm?”

And while he was doing so, he spotted Reitas at the end of the street a moment later.

“Giddyup!”

Manus quickly spurred his horse and sprinted up towards Reitas.

Dududududu.

The sound of horse hooves noisily rang out.

With Reitas in front of him, Manus pulled his reins and got down onto the ground like flying.

Boom!

The weighty armor shook greatly.

Not minding that, Manus walked towards Reitas.

Reitas watched that sight quietly for a moment, then slowly got down from his horse.

When he took about two steps towards Manus, suddenly, Manus kicked off the ground and flew.

Puuuk!

A rough hug.

Manus brightly smiled and hugged Reitas roughly.

“Brother! I went and came back!”

A sight that simply couldn’t be seen as an etiquette of the royalty.

But it was an honest look without a hint of a lie.

Reitas stood still for a moment, then carefully hugged Manus’ back.

“Yeah, you’ve done well.”

He spoke with a soft voice.

Like that, the brothers stood still and passionately hugged each other for a while.

Then.

“Waaaaah!”

The citizens threw up an incredible cheer.

And at the same time.

“Manus! Manus!”

“Manus Pershion! Manus Pershion!”

Everyone chanted Manus’ name.

From nowhere did Reitas’ name rang out.

Reitas tightly hugged Manus and buried his head on his shoulder.

The face that had been gently smiling turned stiff.

He let out a short sigh.

‘Ah…… my beloved little brother Manus, I……’

His heart ached.

‘Can’t seem to leave you like this.’

Once more, a short sigh leaked out.

The sigh rode Manus’ shoulder and disappeared like a wind.

To Pershion Kingdom (3) End.

Chapter 139




T/n (CSV): 1st regular chapter for the week.

Update: ch. 140 will be delayed to tomorrow.

“You bastards! Walk properly!”

“You there, keep your head down! Only look at your feet while you walk!”

Cold and angry shouts hit the ears.

The soldiers on horses moved back and forth and glared.

The hundreds of people, with their wrists and ankles tied with hard ropes, moved their feet with their heads down.

Their appearances were literally a mess.

Their hairs were disheveled and grimy.

They looked horrendous.

But despite that, their faces somehow looked elated.

“You bastards! Don’t smile!”

One of the soldiers on the horses saw that look and shouted angrily.

The people tied up in the ropes erased their smiles with effort and kept their heads down.

“Sons of bitches. So you’ve won the war, is it? I’ve half a mind to cut off all of their heads, but…… tch!”

The soldier who shouted clicked his tongue with a regretful expression.

Another soldier came up and shook his hand.

“Don’t talk nonsense. The moment we chop off their necks, thousands of our prisoners captured by the Pershion Kingdom side will lose their lives.”

“I know! I know that, and that’s why we’re sending them back so meekly like this!”

The two conversed with heavily contorted faces.

Their identities were the soldiers of Istel Kingdom’s Central Corp.

“Damn it. Those bitches of the Istel Kingdom.”

One of the soldiers spat.

The people walking along while tied up with ropes shrank themselves even more in case they got caught up in any unnecessary spark.

They were the Pershion Kingdom’s soldiers who were captured by Istel Kingdom army in the war with Istel Kingdom and Byron Kingdom.

In another word, prisoners.

They were prisoners of war.

‘We’re now going home!’

‘We won the war and even kept our lives!’

The captives exhaled short sighs.

Those were sighs of relief.

Right after the war ended, the Pershion Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom began negotiating the prisoner exchange.

Thankfully, the negotiation finished without a fault.

It was because the Pershion Kingdom, the victorious nation, suggested to exchange each nation’s prisoners without any special conditions.

The Istel Kingdom, whose number of prisoners was much greater, immediately accepted those terms.

“Sons of bitches. We will definitely return this humiliation one day.”

The Istel soldiers spat out curses.

The Pershion prisoners, without showing any reactions, simply hurried their steps.

‘We just need to be patient for just a bit, just a little bit longer.’

The Pershion Kingdom was now right in front of their noses.

Their hearts raced rapidly and their faces flushed red.

From the dreadful war, they were able to miraculously return alive.

Amongst those prisoners, men with familiar faces were there.

‘It’s much more easier than I had thought.’

The person who was keeping his head down and moving along just like the others was in fact Roan.

He disheveled his hair, coated his skin with charcoal, and was heading towards the Pershion Kingdom while mixed amongst the other prisoners.

Of course, Harrison, Brian, and Clay could also be seen behind Roan.

‘Everything is going according to plan.’

The Pershion Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom had just ended a war.

Obviously, any private travel through the borders was completely restricted.

It wasn’t possible to cross over from the Istel Kingdom to the Pershion Kingdom by ordinary means.

Clay, who had already predicted such a situation, proposed one solution.

It, was to use the prisoner exchange between the two kingdoms.

Even though the plan itself was an extraordinary plan, Clay’s talent, who was actually carrying out the plan, was even more outstanding and prodigious.

After meticulously analyzing the executives of the prisoner exchange, he used both a carrot and a stick by luring in both those who were greedy for wealth and those whose backs were fishy.

Once he spread the riches and blackmailed them, they fell and became Clay’s puppets.

Thanks to that, Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay were able to uneventfully mix in with the prisoners and head towards the Pershion Kingdom.

‘We just need to cross the border.’

Once they cross the border, there was no more need to hide their identities.

No, instead, confidently revealing their identities would be much easier in proceeding with the job.

Roan tightly kept his head down and busily moved his feet.

The soldiers and the prisoners crossed the Istel Kingdom’s border gate and moved towards the middle of the buffer zone.

“Ah……”

The prisoner walking at the lead let out a quiet exclamation.

A flag that they had longed for so much was standing up straight in front of them on the opposite side.

Pershion Kingdom.

“Kuuhk.”

“Huuhuhuhk.”

The captives who saw the kingdom’s flag all cried out tears.

“Damn it! Quiet down!”

“Shut up!”

The Istel soldiers roared at them, but the cries didn’t die down easily.

But even so, they couldn’t beat or verbally abuse them as they wished.

Below the Pershion Kingdom flag, more than two thousand soldiers were lined up.

One wrong move and a battle could start.

In the end, the Istel soldiers could only push forwards the captives tangled in ropes forwards.

“Damn it. Pershion bastards. Get the hell out of here!”

Several soldiers couldn’t hold themselves back and spat out curses.

Once the captives departed from the Istel Kingdom side, an incredible number of prisoners from the Pershion Kingdom side also began to move.

Unlike the Pershion prisoners who numbered in the hundreds, the Istel Kingdom prisoners reached several thousands.

Just by seeing this, it could be guessed just how perfect of a victory the Pershion Kingdom had achieved.

“Move quickly!”

“Don’t even look behind you!”

The prisoner exchange finished rapidly without any incidents.

“Booooo!”

“Waaaah!

The moment the prisoner exchange ended, boos and cheers noisily echoed from each sides.

In any case, there was zero possibility of a battle starting in the current situation.

Since that would mean the start of another war.

Because of that, both sides’ soldiers and prisoners could cheer and jeer as much as they wanted.

The side that won, the Pershion Kingdom, cheered and the side that lost, the Istel Kingdom, jeered.

A noisy battle of sounds went back and forth for a while.

“Alright. This much is enough.”

“Let’s go back!”

The two sides, as if rehearsed, returned through each sides’ border gates.

The ropes that bound their wrists and ankles had already been untied a while ago, but that didn’t mean they could get out of formation as they wished.

“There may be the enemy spies. Check the identities at the gate.”

Because there were numerous cases of mixing in and sending spies during a prisoner exchange, it was a process that always had to be done.

Although this wasn’t quite an agreeable procedure in Roan’s position, there wasn’t any need to be concerned.

‘It was exactly because of a situation like this that I received Prince Simon’s permission before coming.’

Currently, Roan hadn’t come to Pershion Kingdom for personal reasons.

He was, at that moment, a formal diplomat who came to the Pershion Kingdom as a representative of the First Prince Simon of the Rinse Kingdom.

The border gates appeared as he thought of various things.

The executive of the prisoner exchange only then lined up the prisoners at one spot, and ordered the soldiers to check their identities one by one.

“Soldier Rams of the Camet Troop Third Squad, Northern Regional Corp Second Corp.”

“Squad Captain Corey of the Ilian Troop Tenth Squad, Northern Regional Corp Third Corp.”

“Soldier……”

The identity check proceeded quickly and precisely.

One of the soldiers stood up in front of Roan.

“Name yourself and your affiliation.”

He spoke in a cold and businesslike manner.

Roan cheerily smiled and put a hand inside his chest pocket.

From deep inside, he took out a dirty cloth.

“What’s this? I said name yourself and your affiliation.”

The soldier frowned at that sight.

Roan paid no attention to him and carefully opened the dirty cloth.

Inside, there was a clean piece of cloth sewed on with highly beautiful and elegant drawing and writing.

That was in fact the emblem of Regate, symbolizing Simon’s status and prestige.

“I said name yourself and your affiliation!”

The soldier shouted once again.

As the situation became noisy, multiple soldiers and the executive swarmed up.

With fierce eyes, they glared at Roan.

‘A spy?’

The lights in all of their eyes were saying so.

Roan, without minding them, raised up the emblem and spoke with a confident and soft voice.

“I am Baron Roan Tale, representative of the Rinse Kingdom’s First Prince and the great lord of the Regate, Simon Rinse, and an official diplomatic agent.”

Boom.

Immediately, silence fell through the area.

The Pershion Kingdom’s soldier, all with confounded looks, stared at Roan.

The one who broke the silence was Roan.

“Guide me to the capital, Althus.”

A dauntless and daring mannerism and speech.

A look that naturally exuded dignity.

Roan didn’t lose spirit even in front of a foreign kingdom’s soldiers.

That was the true bearing of a great general.

*****

“A representative of Rinse Kingdom’s First Prince Simon?”

“Yes. He says he is Baron Roan Tale.”

“Roan Tale? By Roan Tale, perhaps……”

“Yes. However we look, it seems he is the Crimson Ghost.”

“Hmm. The Crimson Ghost……”

A short groan leaked out.

The person who leaked the groan was the Pershion Kingdom’s first prince, Reitas Pershion.

‘The Crimson Ghost showed up at our kingdom?’

He too had heard a lot about the Crimson Ghost, Roan Tale.

Reitas raised his head and looked his aide and a noble of the the kingdom, Baron Baite Inges.

“Are you certain that he isn’t a representative of Rinse Kingdom’s king but the First Prince Simon?”

“It is certain. They say that he had definitely named himself so.”

Reitas creased his brows.

‘Not the king, but the first prince sent a diplomat?’

It was ridiculous statement.

“And the purpose of the visit?”

“He said that it is for friendship between the two kingdoms. He is currently coming to Althus Castle.”

“Hmm.”

Those words weren’t something that he could believe so easily.

The Rinse Kingdom was currently in a middle of a competition for the succession of the throne.

It wasn’t a situation where any one prince could show diplomacy.

‘Then that must mean there is another underlying motive besides creating a friendship between the two kingdoms……’

And a goal that is advantageous for Simon, a goal that Simon needs at that.

Reitas fell into thought.

‘The timing too is strange……’

Until now, there was no significant dealings between the Pershion Kingdom and the Rinse Kingdom to speak of.

Since there is the Byron and the Istel between the two kingdoms and because of the long distance, there was no real need to trade.

Suddenly, Reitas’ eyes widely opened.

‘Perhaps is it because of Manus?’

Reitas’ face stiffened.

The reason that the Rinse Kingdom, and the First Prince Simon at that, who should be in middle of a competition for the throne, had sent a diplomat.

Considering the various circumstances and the timing, there was a high probability that it was related to Manus.

‘Is the goal not a friendship with our kingdom but with Manus?’

It wasn’t a bad choice from Simon’s position.

‘Since that side should know that Kallum and I are friends……’

But even so, it couldn’t be helped that the situation itself felt irritating.

‘An attitude that ignores me, the kingdom’s first prince.’

Of course, this was only if Reitas’ prediction was correct.

‘I should watch for now.’

He raised his head and turned to Baite.

“I don’t know what kind of scheme it is, but he is the kingdom’s honorable guest for now. Greet him courteously.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Baite immediately lowered his head then exited the office.

Reitas, who was left alone, rubbed his forehead with his right hand and closed his eyes.

‘Simon, Roan……’

The two names rolled within the mouth.

‘The things are slowly getting bigger.’

And at a much faster speed than what he thought.

Reitas exhaled a short sigh.

‘Is there truly no other way……’

For an instant, a pained look flickered past.

But soon, a cold and sharp air gathered in his eyes and mouth.

‘It cannot be helped. Since I can’t have the seat taken away even if there is no other choice.’

His face was a one that looked to have firmly decided on something.

That day at that moment, Reitas cleared up one concern that had tormented him.

‘I’m sorry.’

The same words circled inside him again and again.

But only Reitas could knew whether those were his true feelings or not.

*****

“Althus Castle is quite plain.”

Brian looked outside the carriage and muttered.

Clay smiled cheerfully and answered.

“It is since the Pershion Kingdom is a small nation compared to our Rinse Kingdom, the Byron Kingdom, and the Istel Kingdom.”

“Is it? Even so, I thought it was a kingdom with quite a long history.”

Bryon looked at Clay and tilted his head.

Clay closed the book he was reading and turned to Brian.

“The Pershion Kingdom was also a strong kingdom that once conquered the continent’s northeast. But as inept kings ruled over multiple generations, rebellions endlessly appeared from various regions and was divided into tens of big and small kingdoms in the end.”

“Ah, I know of that story. Afterwards, Lloyd Von Pershion came to rule, conquered most of the small nations, and raised the current Pershion Kingdom.”

“Yes. But despite so, they had lost more than half of their lands compared to before. And the one who united those other lands and raised a new kingdom was the very Madison Von Light. This is the founding story of the Light Kingdom currently at the continent’s northeastern end.”

Brian nodded at Clay’s words.

It was because he remembered the continent’s history he had heard during his days at the academy.

At that moment, Harrison, who had been listening to the story, squinted and asked.

“Then, the Pershion Kingdom and the Light Kingdom must be sworn enemies, no?”

As soon as he spoke those words, Roan and Clay answered at the same time.

“No, instead, they’re significantly close.”

“That isn’t so. Instead, their relationship is more closer to brother nations.”

At those words, Harrison made a slightly surprised expression.

“How is that so, sir?”

He tilted his head as if he simply couldn’t understand.

“That’s because in the last several decades, the king of Light……’

The moment Roan’s words reached that point.

The Coachman’s voice was heard.

“We have arrived at the capital, Althus Castle. But……”

His voice was slightly flustered.

At that moment, an officer riding on a war horse approached next to the carriage.

“Prince Reitas Pershion has came out to greet you! We need to stop the carriage.

It was a completely unexpected welcome.

No, situation.

“Then do so.”

Roan answered briefly then straightened his clothes.

Clay faintly smiled and cautiously spoke.

“It seems the Pershion Kingdom’s First Prince is also feeling a bit hot.” 1

Roan formed a peculiar expression at those words and shook his head.

“Perhaps. We won’t know until we meet him. Whether he is heated……”

The carriage’s speed gradually slowed down.

Roan looked out the window and murmured with a quiet voice.

“Or whether he is ice cold.”

Whatever it was, it wasn’t an easy situation.

But if it was the latter.

‘We may have to worry about our lives.’

To Pershion Kingdom (4) End.

Chapter 140




T/n (CSV): 2nd regular chapter for the week. Sorry about the lateness.

“Oh! Baron Tale. You’ve done well coming all this way.”

Prince Reitas Pershion widely opened his arms and offered a warm greeting.

Roan slightly lowered his head.

“Greetings to Prince Reitas Pershion. I am Roan Tale.”

“I have heard much of the Crimson Ghost. They say that you are excellent in not only strategy and tactics but also in skills as a warrior.”

Reitas and the Pershion Kingdom Army hearing of the Crimson Ghost’s rumors were thanks to the Istel Kingdom prisoners.

In the process of collecting information related to the Istel Kingdom, they had naturally learnt of the stories about the Crimson Ghost Roan Tale.

‘He’s different than what we heard. They said that his hair, eyebrows, and eyes were red……’

Reitas stared straight into Roan’s eyes.

“That is an excessive complement, sir. I was simply lucky.’

Roan faintly smiled and lowered his head.

Reitas nodded and stepped to the side.

“I’ve heard that you’ve went through some trouble crossing the border. For now, let us go greet his majesty the king, then enjoy a banquet.”

“Thank you for your considerations.”

Roan slightly lowered his head and then entered the carriage Reitas had prepared.

‘Reitas Pershion……’

Today was the first time that he had personally seen Reitas.

In the last life, he had received the crown from his father, King Ave Von Pershion, and completely transformed the Pershion Kingdom into a powerful nation.

‘Including the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom, they conquered over one hundred castles.’

Due to this, the Byron Kingdom had to neglect the border with the Rinse Kingdom in order to face the Pershion Kingdom.

At the same time, the Rinse Kingdom attacked the Byron Kingdom in such state, taking tens of castles.

‘Perhaps that too may have been one of the reasons the Great Warring Era started.’

Roan slightly raised his head and looked at Reitas, who was staring outside the window.

A handsome face and a rugged appearance.

He certainly exuded the presence of a prince.

But.

‘Somehow, there is an uncomfortable feeling……’

Was it perhaps because he was experiencing the Rinse Kingdom’s throne succession competition and knew of the tragic future of the Pershion royalty?

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

‘For now, I must greet the Pershion King and then meet Prince Manus.’

That was the goal of this visit.

Even while Roan was thinking about other things, the carriage busily continued on and soon entered the palace.

“Everyone is waiting.”

Reitas got off the carriage first and then headed towards the grand hall in the middle of the palace.

Harrison, Brian, and Clay, who had followed behind separately, looked at Roan with slightly tense expressions.

Faintly smiling as if to say there is no need to worry, Roan slowly walked forwards.

‘It’s plain just like the capital.’

The Pershion Kingdom’s palace was smaller and plainer than Rinse Kingdom’s palace.

It was a point that vividly showed the difference in their national strength.

The guards, who were already waiting at every place they went through, opened the door.

Without pausing even once and walking on, they arrived in front of the hall where the king and the ministers were waiting.

Reitas lightly glanced back at Roan and nodded, then lightly clapped his hands.

Suddenly.

Kuuuuuung.

The gigantic doors opened to the sides and the inside of the grand hall revealed itself.

‘Hhm.’

Roan unknowingly swallowed back a groan.

The grand hall that spread out in front of his eyes shocked him for two reasons.

The first was its splendor.

Unlike the capital or the palace that he had seen until now, the inside of the grand hall was adorned with all kinds of jewels and gold.

It was to the point where his eyes hurt from the light the jewels shined.

‘I had heard that the current king was extravagant, so it must be because of that.’

Roan smiled bitterly and stepped inside the grand hall.

Immediately, a suffocating and sweltering heat assaulted his entire body.

The second reason he was shocked from seeing the inside of the hall.

That was because of the incredible number of nobles and military commanders who that lined the two sides of the hall.

Standing straight in attention, all of them stared at Roan and his companions, and the light in their eyes was fierce and blistering.

‘They must be wondering what the goal of the visit is.’

There had been no significant contact between the two sides for decades.

Since Roan had visited not as a representative of the king but the first prince in such a situation, It was obvious that they would be quite suspicious.

“That man is the Crimson Ghost?”

“Isn’t he completely different than what we heard?”

“Furthermore, he’s too young.

“Is he really that Crimson Ghost who is said to have defeated the Istel Kingdom army?”

The nobles and the commanders murmured.

But completely ignoring them, Roan walked up in front of the throne and kneeled down on one knee.

“I greet your majesty the King Ave Von Pershion.”

An elderly man sat crookedly on the throne

A face that looked much older than his actual age, hazy eyes, and a pose that sagged powerlessly.

It was a look that simply drained all the tension of anyone who saw him.

That man was Ave, the current king of Pershion Kingdom.

“So you came from the Rinse Kingdom?”

A sudden informal reception.

It was discourteous.

But Ave didn’t think important of honor nor courtesy.

Leaning his chin on his right hand, he asked again with an annoyed look.

“For what reason did you come all the way here for?”

With his knee still kneeling, Roan answered.

“It is to create a friendly relationship.”

“Friendly relationship? When our kingdom and the Rinse Kingdom are far apart from one another?

And even though you talk of making a friendly relationship, you came not as the king’s but as the first prince’s proxy?”

“That is……”

For a while, Roan meticulously explained the principle of befriending a faraway nation and attacking the ones near. 1

Furthermore, he expressed how the two could check the Istel Kingdom and the Byron Kingdom if the two allied.

On top of this, he stressed that this visit of friendship was a great mission that the First Prince Simon had undertook after raising various deeds.

Ave, after listening for a while, soon shook his hand.

“That’s it. Stop. Talk with the ministers instead about such headache-raising stories.”

He then smacked his lips and stood up.

“I’ll entrust this matter to Reitas…… no.”

Ave, who had spoke up to that point, contemplated a bit and then opened his mouth again.

“I’ll entrust this work to Reitas and Manus. These two people, take care of it on your own.”

Then he soon moved his feet and exited the hall.

It was a truly disrespectful manner for facing a diplomat of a foreign nation.

But Roan didn’t show any particular reaction.

‘Either way, I didn’t expect much from King Ave.’

Instead, he was worried that the incompetent man would hold him back, but since he stepped back on his on, Roan felt much more relieved.

But Reitas’ expression, who had in fact been entrusted the heavy duty, was not good.

‘Together with Manus……’

If it was like before, Reitas would have undertook all the big and small works of the kingdom and manage them.

Ave, the incompetent king and father, held no interest in politics.

Everything was Reitas’ to take.

He had enjoyed that and had also thought proud of it.

‘Is even the King now bearing Manus in mind.’

His mouth felt bitter.

But even so, he didn’t explode in anger nor show any signs of discomfort.

‘Since that’s something only amateurs do.’

Reitas breathed in deeply and turned to the nobles and the commanders lining up on the sides.

“Since we have separately prepared a banquet, everyone, please do be sure to attend.”

“Yes. We shall do so.”

Everyone lowered their heads and answered.

From a glance, their expressions looked as if they were following all of Reitas’ orders.

However, they were each absorbed in complicated thoughts.

‘Should I be following Prince Reitas, or Prince Manus.’

‘Who is taking the leadership of the politics?’

The Pershion Kingdom’s nobles, just like the Rinse Kingdom’s nobles, had also began to weigh the two princes.

This was a slightly faster development than what Roan had experienced in the last life.

Although, he himself didn’t know of this truth.

“Baron Tale. I shall guide you to the banquet hall.”

“Thank you very much.”

Roan stood up from his seat and lowered his head.

‘I should be able to naturally meet Prince Manus.’

If the banquet opened up in a large scale, Manus too, who had been jointly entrusted this topic, would attend.

However, that was a miscalculation.

In the banquet that would open up from then on, a strange experience awaited.

Soon, with Reitas and Roan at the lead, numerous people moved their feet towards the banquet hall.

Clay, who had been quietly watching, silently kept his place and then discreetly headed outside the grand hall.

‘As expected, the mood of the palace is unusual from Prince Manus’ prominence.’

From the moment he had heard that Manus had defeated the Byron and Istel’s allied army and saved the Pershion Kingdom, he expected that the events would flow bizarrely.

‘The thing called power, you simply can’t let go of it after tasting it once.’

In Reitas’ position, it was a situation where he had to share the power, that he had all but grasped, with his brother.

No, it was a situation where it may be all snatched away.

‘And here, if the numerous nobles and powerful families attach themselves to one of the two princes……’

Possibly, an event even more ferocious than the Rinse Kingdom’s throne succession competition may happen.

‘At least our Kingdom has three princes so it’s possible to keep each other in check, but……’

The Pershion Kingdom only had two, Reitas and Manus.

If one person’s power became too big, the other could only be swallowed.

‘First, I must grasp the mood of the capital, Althus, and the palace.’

With calm and composed eyes, Clay quickened his steps.

Flap.

He lightly shook his two hands.

It may seemed like a meaningless movement from a glance, but.

Flutter.

Five small birds flew up above his head.

They circled above Clay’s head, then soon scattered in every direction.

*****

The banquet was at an incredible scale enough for all the nobles and commanders gathered at the grand hall to attend.

Roan sat opposite of Reitas and tilted their drinks.

Next to him sat Harrison, Brian, and Clay, who had appeared late.

On the other side sat the kingdom’s duke, marquis, and count.

‘To think that I would share drinks and seats with a foreign kingdom’s prince and nobles.’

Harrison unknowingly gulped.

On the other hand, Brian and Clay were greatly relaxed.

As the banquet progressed, they instead went around and chatted with the Pershion Kingdom’s young nobles and military commanders.

Thanks to them, the banquet blossomed further the longer it went.

But wherever one went, there would always be someone who would break the good mood.

“Hmph! So even the rumors of the Crimson Ghost were all empty rumors.”

A rather loud noise rang throughout the banquet hall.

The people who had been laughing and chatting searched the owner of the voice and turned their heads.

“Kuhu. What great drink!”

The one who once again shouted aloud was a man with a massive build.

Reitas, who was tipping his cup at the table, slightly frowned.

“Viscount Corin. It seems you’ve drank too much.”

He admonished in a quiet voice.

“There’s still more to go before I get drunk, sir!”

The massively built man, Viscount Harvey Corin, once again chugged the cup and slammed down on a table.

Boom!

Several delicate nobles, from the sudden shock, shrunk their bodies.

“The Istel prisoner bastards said that the Crimson Ghost literally brought to mind a war god. They have said that he, with a single spear, controlled the soaring flames like his own limbs and handled hundreds of enemies like playing with kids. Not only that, he is said to have not only stopped all of Istel Kingdom’s attacks but also assaulted their supply storage and led the war to victory.”

Although they was slightly exaggerated, those words were all true.

With slitted eyes, Harvey stared at Roan.

“And so I had thought that Baron Roan Tale, who is called the Crimson Ghost, would be a general with incredible skills. But when I look at him today, this is no more than a child who still smells of……”

“Harvey Corin!”

Reitas cut into his words and roared.

“Khhm.”

Harvey couldn’t quite finish his words and coughed.

But that didn’t meant that his complaints had ended.

Filling up his mug, he muttered in a quiet voice.

“Since the Istel bastards didn’t have much to show, they had blown up the rumors like that. Perhaps even Prince Manus defeating the Istel bastards wasn’t such a hard thing.”

Manus’ name abruptly came out of nowhere.

“Do stop yourself now.”

Reitas once again admonished him.

“Yes. Yes. Understood. From now on, I’ll have my mouth shut tight.”

Harvey repeatedly nodded his head and then emptied his cup in one shot.

Reitas looked at that sight and made an awkward smile towards Roan.

“Baron Tale. Please forgive this disgrace. Viscount Harvey Corin has became drunk and had made a slip of his tong……”

The moment he spoke to that point, a young military commander, who had been tipping his cup while sitting at one side, abruptly stood up.

“Viscount Corin! No, Commander Corin! Were those words just now denouncing Prince Manus’ military achievement?”

The moment he spoke those words, several young commanders also echoed his voice.

“I don’t think that should be something a sir who had consistently been losing early on in the war should say, though?”

“Prince Manus is someone who had saved the kingdom with a disadvantageous strength. He isn’t someone who should be hearing such critique.”

“Commander! Please take back your statement just now!”

The mood turned turbulant in an instant.

Harvey, who was emptying his cup with his mouth shut, exploded out a crazed laugh.

“Hahaha! You green bastards! So the children who just went out to the battlefield are pointing their fingers to a great commander of hundred battlefields!”

He then slammed violently down on the table.

Kaang!

“You’re overly arrogant and impudent just because you became a bit famous these days!”

Harvey suddenly jumped up from his seat and glared at the young commanders.

Then, the older commanders followed and stood up from their seats.

“Right! Commander Corin, you said it well. Even without it, I’ve not liked these young ones jumping around without knowing ups and downs.”

“The fledglings who had only been out on the battlefield for two, three years dare to treat us like some senile old men?”

“Have you forgotten all the achievements that we put our lives on and fought for!”

The mood turned even more tempestuous.

Between the preexisting commanders and the young commanders, a sharp atmosphere roared.

But for some reason, Reitas didn’t show any sign of attempting to intervene.

With his eyes closed, he was holding up an empty cup.

He looked to be in thought.

From a glance, it looked to be so.

But.

‘Viscount Harvey Corin. You’ve done well.’

Inwardly, he was smiling.

Harvey’s discourteous action was all Reitas’ plot.

‘So the faction following Manus is already this much, is it……’

To discriminate those supporting Manus amongst the nobles and the commanders, he purposely started an fuss.

He had thought that if he used Roan, who was called the Crimson Ghost amongst the Istel Kingdom soldiers, he could naturally create the episode.

‘Hmm.’

Reitas let out a short sigh.

He slowly opened his eyes and put down the cup he was holding up.

“Baron Tale. It seems our commanders have all became drunk. I’ll have to end the banquet at this point.”

“Yes. I have already had plenty to drink.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

Then, he soon led Harrison, Brian, and Clay, and exited the banquet hall.

Even in that while.

“Aren’t you saying too much!”

“How dare the immature one!”

The banquet hall was greatly clamorous.

“Huu!”

Roan, who went outside, spat out a long sigh.

He then turned to Harrison, Brian, and Clay, and asked shortly.

“How is it?”

“Yes?”

Harrison and Brian, not understanding his meaning, tilted their heads.

But only Clay formed a faint smile and answered.

“However it is, it’s strange.”

“As expected……”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

Smiling faintly, he whispered in a quiet voice.

“It seems Prince Reitas probably intends to use me as a chess piece.”

To Pershion Kingdom (5) End.

Chapter 141




T/n (CSV): 3rd regular chapter for the week. For the next two weeks or so, st8_lupe will be busy, so Kajin will be editing the chapters in the meantime.

“As expected, there are more than we thought.”

“Yes. Amongst the young nobles and warriors, half of them support Prince Manus.”

“Hmph!”

The owner of the cold laugh was Prince Reitas Pershion.

Receiving the report of the scribes he had stationed at the banquet hall, he creased his brows.

‘It’s already a significant number just with the ones who openly support him. If I include those who support him secretly or are hesitating between me and Manus, that number should increase further.’

His heart felt heavy.

‘I thought that they said I’ve also done quite well until now……’

In fact, he had excellently ran the kingdom’s management in place of the incompetent king.

The result wasn’t bad either.

Although it was a bit lacking compared to the neighboring countries, he was confident that it could stand up as equals with them if he continued to devote his strength.

‘I thought that they all approved and followed me.’

When Manus suddenly achieved the incredible deed, the foundation that he had thought to be strong began to shake from the roots.

What made it more bitter was the fact that Reitas knew the reason why.

‘Manus knows how to steal other people’s hearts.’

It wasn’t a technique.

That was a type of a gifted talent and charisma.

Without any special acts or words, he could turn the people around him to his supporters.

Now that that kind of guy had, intentionally or not, stepped up onto the political stage, it was natural that people’s attention would focus on Manus.

“And Baron Tale?”

“For now, there is no sign of him contacting Prince Manus.”

“Continue to watch him.”

It had only been two days since the banquet ended.

If Roan’s goal of the visit was related to Manus, it should more or less be a time that he showed some kind of movement.

“And to Manus and his close aides, increase the surveillance perso……’

When he had spoke up to that point.

Knock, knock, knock.

The sound of knocking on the conference room door rang out.

“Who is it?”

One of his close aides, Baron Baite Inges, asked in Reitas’ place.

“It’s Katz, sir.”

Baronet Katz Hamner was the head butler who managed the mansion that Reitas resided.

Baite turned his head and looked at Reitas.

When Reitas nodded his head, Baite answered in a loud voice.

“Come in.”

The moment he spoke those words, the conference room’s door opened carefully.

From between the narrowly opened door, an old man in late middle age, Katz, extended his head in.

“A person came from the Boen Guild.”

“Boen Guild?”

Reitas, who had been staying quiet, creased his brows.

One of the close aides tilted his head.

“If it’s Boen Guild, isn’t it a thieves guild?”

“Yes, that is correct. It’s the largest guild in the kingdom.”

Katz answered with a polite expression.

Reitas stared straight at Katz.

“For what business did he come to me?”

“He has brought an important letter. He said that the Prince had to personally check the letter’s sender and the contents……”

“Hmm.”

Reitas leaked a quiet groan.

It wasn’t something that could be comprehended easily.

Boen Guild was the largest thieves guild in the Kingdom.

Obviously, the guards as well as even the Kingdom’s troops were chasing the bastards’ backs with light in their eyes.

‘There is no way that they don’t know that we plan to arrest every single one of them.’

But for them to visit him despite that must mean that this was significantly important matter.

Reitas nodded after ending a short contemplation.

Seeing that sight, Katz slightly lowered his head and disappeared.

A moment later.

Kkiiig.

The conference room’s doors opened cautiously and an ordinary looking young man appeared.

Stepping up in front of Reitas, he kneeled down on one knee and lowered his head.

“I greet your highness Prince Reitas Pershion.”

“You said there’s an important letter?”

He went straight to the point.

Reitas didn’t wished to have a long talk with likes of a lowly thief.

This was the very difference between him and Manus.

Although the person himself completely didn’t understood why that became a problem.

“Yes. It is a letter delivered with the cooperation of three guilds, including us, Boen Guild.”

“Three guilds? Who is the sender?”

Reitas frowned as he asked.

Even the close aide nobles, including Baite, had curious expressions.

The young man, with his knee still kneeled and head lowered, placed his right hand inside his chest pocket.

Chang!

Immediately, the commanders around him pulled out their swords in reflex and pointed them at his throat.

“The letter is in the chest pocket.”

The young man, with a slightly nervous look, very slowly took out the hand he put inside the chest pocket.

A small and thin envelope came out between the tips of his fingers.

“Here it is, sir.”

Although his voice shook a bit at the end, he wasn’t frightened.

One of the commanders snatched the letter and politely passed it to Reitas.

Reitas glanced over the outside of the envelope.

There was nothing written there.

Rip.

When he opened the mouth of the envelope and took out the letter, he could see tightly written contents.

It was a familiar handwriting.

For a long while, Reitas carefully perused the letter’s content.

The more he read, a smile kept creeping up on his mouth.

That was, somehow, a sinister smile.

“Huhuhu, so is that so……”

Reitas folded the letter and placed it inside the envelope once again, and then turned towards the young man.

“You’ve delivered an important letter well. I shall grant a handsome compensation.”

“Thank you very much.”

The young man once again lowered his head and then exited the conference room with a young noble.

Baite asked in a cautious voice seemingly as if he was waiting.

“What kind of letter is it, sir?”

At those words, Reitas faintly smiled and muttered in a quiet voice.

“It’s a letter from an old friend.”

The smile on the tip of his mouth became even darker.

“A friend living in a very far away place.”

*****

“Although it’s plain compared to the Miller Castle, this is a truly clean and well organized city.”

“Yes. And even the residents’ expressions seem very good.”

The people who were quietly chatting as they walked the streets inside Althus Castle were Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay.

After the banquet ended few days ago, they were walking around the inside of Althus Castle, the capital of the Pershion Kingdom, and broadening their experiences.

Since they had came far, they were determined to learn at least a single thing.

Of course, they were fully answering invitations of Reitas or powerful nobles.

“Anyway, is there still no response from Prince Manus’ side?”

“Yes. we’ve sent a letter several times, but there is no answer.”

At Roan’s question, Clay quickly answered.

Currently, Roan had sent a letter several times in order to meet Manus.

Although he couldn’t carelessly extend his hand due to analysing the surrounding moods, since it was the goal of the visit, it was more or less time to meet Manus.

But for some reason, there was no reaction from Manus’ side.

‘How troublesome.’

But even so, he couldn’t thoughtlessly go visit Manus.

That was an act that went against courtesy, but most of all, it could drag in excessive attention from Reitas if he were to pointlessly raise a fuss.

‘Even without that, the number of spies around us increased.’

Using the Kalian’s Tears and Flamdor Mana Technique, Roan had noticed those who circled around or stayed near him.

‘Do I have to find another way……’

Roan fell into deep thoughts as he walked the streets bustling with crowds.

At that moment.

“You bad Istel guys! Die!”

“We are the brave Pershion Kingdom army!”

“Waaaaa!”

Childish voices hit his ears.

At a small vacant space at the end of a street, small boys and girls were gathered playing make-believe war.

All holding shoddy sticks and pieces of planks, they divided into three groups and repeatedly touched and separated.

One of the children who looked like their leader raised a stick up high.

“My name is Manus Pershion! Take my sword!”

That very boy seemed to have taken the role of the protagonist.

When he swung his stick, the children standing in front of him all collapsed.

The surprising thing was that amongst those children, a tall and mature young man was there.

“For a fully grown man to play a make-believe war with children…… he is an interesting young man.”

Brian brightly smiled and whispered.

Harrison and Clay too nodded their heads and made amused expressions.

Meanwhile, the young man who fell playfully grasped his chest and rolled on the ground.

“Ugh!”

He even let out a pained groan.

“Waaaah! Prince Manus beat the Byron and Istel allied army!”

“Hurray! Hurray!”

The children who followed the leading child raised their hands up high and cheered.

Then, the boys and girls who had fallen also stood up instantly, came together, and cheered

The young man who rolled on the ground also shouted along with the children and cheered.

“Hahaha!”

A hearty laugh filled the empty lot.

Suddenly, the young man who had been jumping around like a mischief noticed Roan and his group standing at the entrance of the lot.

He instantly stood still, then stepped away from the children and walked towards Roan.

Tap, tap.

Even though the surrounding was definitely noisy, it felt as if he could clearly hear the sound of his steps.

Roan quietly stood still and stared at the face of the young man who approached.

Boom.

A feeling as if his heart suddenly dropped.

The tips of his eyes trembled sharply.

‘This young man……’

He could feel an intense trembling from deep within his body.

That was also the same for the young man.

‘This man……’

He stood in front of Roan and quietly stared into his eyes.

Roan and the young man, the two stared at each other without a word.

And as if they planned beforehand, they both formed bright smiles.

Roan could tell.

‘It’s this person.’

He slowly bowed at his waist.

“It is an honor to meet you.’

He spoke in a calm voice.

“Prince Manus Pershion.”

The instant he spoke those words, Harrison, Brian, and Clay, who had been behind him, hurriedly lowered their heads.

‘Manus?’

‘That young man is Prince Manus Pershion?’

They slightly creased their foreheads.

Clay especially had an expression that simply couldn’t believe it even more than them.

‘Even though my lord shouldn’t know Prince Manus’ face?’

It was an incomprehensible situation.

At that moment, the young man, who had been standing still, lowered his head and spoke in a soft voice.

“I am also honored to meet you, Baron Roan Tale.”

The young man, he was truly Manus Pershion.

And he too noticed Roan’s identity instantly.

It wasn’t because he knew the face.

He could feel and become certain the instant he saw him.

Roan and Manus once again raised their heads and stared at each other’s face.

‘This person……’

The two people, at the same time, thought the same thought.

‘Isn’t an ordinary person.’

The tips of their mouths slowly went up.

Roan and Manus.

The meeting of the two heroes who would shake the continent was formed suddenly like so.

Along with an intense echo.

*****

“Kallum, at least for this time, let us combine our strengths.”

“Yes, older brother Tommy. Since we have lost the lead to elder brother Simon this time as well.”

Within a brilliant reception room.

In the middle, Tommy and Kallum sat facing each other and were exchanging a secret conversation.

“Damn it, to think he would find the news of Pershion Kingdom’s war so much earlier than us.”

Tommy spat out a swear with a look mixed with irritation.

After Roan had left to Pershion Kingdom, the news of the Pershion Kingdom, the Byron Kingdom, and the Istel Kingdom’s war reached the capital, Miller.

The appearance of a prominent hero called Manus Pershion fiercely heated up the Rinse Kingdom.

Obviously, talks of forming a friendly relationship with the Pershiono Kingdom came out of numerous ministers’ mouths.

Kallum had thought of it as a chance.

Using Reitas, who was a close friend with him, he planned to raise a big achievement.

But at that moment, Simon stepped up to the front.

On that spot and with a confident and proud attitude, he revealed the truth that he had already sent Roan to the Pershion Kingdom.

“Huu, that sly man.”

Kallum exhaled a short sigh.

“Thanks to that, only we’ve been marked as incompetent ones again.”

Tommy’s face twisted even further.

But he soon looked at Kallum and formed a peculiar smile.

“But this time, things should go well thanks to you.”

“I never expected that I should receive Reitas’ help in this way.”

Kallum quietly muttered and then leaned his chin on his folded hands.

Realizing that he was a step behind Simon, he quickly allied with Tommy.

It was because the gap in the throne succession competition would widen too much if they lost even the achievement this time.

Using the thieves guild under Tommy’s influence, Kallum sent a secret letter to Reitas.

“I have also meticulously wrote the information on Harrison, Brian, and Clay who are said to have went with him.”

“Right. We shouldn’t make light of those guys. Especially that guy called Clay.”

“Yes. Since even Reitas wouldn’t have thought that a druid could possibly have appeared again.”

The fact that Clay was a druid was widely known around the capital, Miller.

That was because he had personally revealed himself as a druid when he rounded up the Janis information agency in one move.

“The leak in the information on our side too, it must all be that guy’s work.”

“And because of that, didn’t we now put up a mana barrier like this?”

The two people looked at each other and made acrid smiles.

Around the meeting room, small mana stones shined light.

Tommy and Kallum then grabbed cups of wine.

“Then, should we await the good news?”

Kallum nodded at Tommy’s words.

If the work this time goes well, Simon’s spirit would fall flat.

“It should be quite a sad news for older brother Simon.”

Kallum cheerfully smiled and moved his cup.

Chang.

The cups touched each other and a clear sound rang out.

Even while tipping their cups, Tommy and Kallum didn’t take their eyes off of each other.

The two were thinking similar thoughts.

After brother Simon, it’s your turn next.’

‘After elder brother Simon, older brother is next.’

*****

From their first meeting, Roan and Manus felt a strong attraction towards each other.

Although the two wanted to immediately move to another place and talk, Manus suddenly received a summon from the palace and could only promise of another day.

“I’ll definitely make sure to invite you.”

After talking with him, they found out that, unexpectedly, Manus wasn’t able to check the invitations Roan had sent until now.

It was because there was almost no time in which he spent inside his mansion after returning to the capital, Althus Castle.

Watching Manus leaving towards the palace, Roan made a faint smile.

“He is a much better person than I thought.”

Harrison, who was near him, nodded at those words.

“Yes. I had never expected that he, even with the status of a prince, would be playing along with commoner children.”

“And furthermore, with the children of the soldiers who died in the war this time……”

Brian formed a peculiar look as he added on.

Manus was completely different person than the royalty he knew of.

‘The nameless soldiers who could only die due to his order. For them, Manus lowered his head.’

Roan breathed in deeply.

The heart that trembled and ached calmed down.

Manus searched and visited the people who lost their fathers, husbands, older and younger brothers, and so on from the war and lowered his head.

He absolutely didn’t care whether they were royalties, nobles, commoners, or slaves.

To him, they were all one family.

‘If Manus lives and blossoms his abilities……’

The Pershion Kingdom would join the ranks of the strongest nations in the continent’s northeast.

“Anyway……”

Roan, who had been thinking of various thoughts, turned his head and looked at Clay.

“A sudden summon to the palace, isn’t it strange?”

Furthermore, he could feel the surrounding personnel that were spying on them jolt intensely.

Clay stepped tightly close to Roan and nodded his head.

“Yes. This does not feel very good, sir. Most of all……”

With a quiet voice, he added on.

His face was somewhat serious.

“The birds have all died.”

Veiled Strife (1) End.

Chapter 142




T/n (CSV): Sponsored Chapter. Apologies to the sponsors for the issue. Next chapter will be the regular chapter on Sunday, hopefully with the sponsored chapter.

“That the birds have all died means……?”

“It probably means that Prince Reitas’ side has noticed something, sir.”

Roan, Clay, Harrison, and Brian returned to their residence and secretly chatted.

Roan also knew that Clay was using birds to collect information.

This was because Clay had reported it afterwards.

Although it was something that was acted on before the report, he didn’t have any particular plans to reprimand him.

This was because understanding the information of the surroundings when in a faraway nation became that great a strength.

“Is there a proof that Prince Reitas’ side is responsible for this?”

Brian, who was next to him, asked cautiously.

Clay slowly nodded his head.

“According to the information they have sent before they died, it is certain. Prince Reitas has called mages and been searching for the signs of druids.”

“Ah……!”

Brian leaked out a quiet exclaim.

Roan, who was submerged in thought, asked Clay with a quiet voice.

“Then does this mean your identity has become known even here?”

“Yes. The possibility of that is high.”

Harrison frowned at those words.

“Pershion Kingdom’s intelligence strength doesn’t seem that great, though?”

Clay nodded his head.

“Yes. That is correct. Compared to us, the Pershion Kingdom’s intelligence strength is at a paltry level.”

“Then how……?”

“There are plenty of methods to find out my, no our identities regardless of one’s intelligence strength. For example, Someone may have purposely told them our identities.”

The light in his eyes calmed down coldly.

But the tips of his mouth at least were slightly raised.

It was a strange smile.

Brian, who had been listening, asked in a cautious manner.

“By someone……?”

Clay answered without a hesitation.

“In this situation, the possibility of it being Prince Kallum Rinse is high.”

Clay.

Just from the fact that the birds he let out for espionage had died, he had instantly inferred who had intruded on the current situation.

Roan nodded his head.

“The probability of Prince Kallum sending a letter to Prince Reitas, who is his friend, is plenty enough.”

“The problem is……”

With a slightly serious voice unlike him, Clay spoke up.

“There is almost zero possibility that he had only wrote about our identities in the letter.”

“What do you mean?”

Harrison slightly creased his forehead.

Clay faintly smiled.

“It means that if I was Prince Kallum, I would have also written in a frightening request.”

“Hmm.”

Roan let out a quiet groan.

He understood the meaning of Clay’s words right away.

“The situation is flowing complicatedly. Then is it impossible to get information on Prince Reitas’ side anymore?”

In such a situation and in a foreign country, especially within a territory of someone who may be an enemy, losing one’s eyes and ears was a greatly dangerous thing.

Clay contemplated for a moment, then exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. It isn’t such that there isn’t any method, sir.”

“Hhm?”

Roan wordlessly stared into Clay’s eyes.

Clay calmly gazed at that stare, and then slowly lowered his head.

“Please leave Prince Reitas’ side to me. I will……”

Already, confidence overflowed in his voice.

“Become my lord’s eyes and ears.”

*****

“As expected, it is so.”

Within a reception room inside the palace, Clay formed a strange smile.

As a member of a foreign envoy, his access to the palace was on the freer side, but he couldn’t roam beyond the restricted areas.

For this reason, Clay, at an area that is allowed access, raised all of his senses and observed the aura within the palace.

‘The number of mages are approximately ten.’

As expected, it was all because of the mages that the birds, which had undertook the espionage mission, had died.

‘Their skills are about third circle……’

If so, it wasn’t too hopeless a situation.

‘I wanted to refrain from doing this since it seriously hurts after doing it once, but……’

Clay bitterly smiled and entered a well groomed flowerbed outside the reception room’s terrace.

It was a sight that, if someone saw, one would click his tongue asking just why would anyone go in there.

A moment later.

Meow.

With a cute cry, a cat suddenly jumped out.

It shook its body back and forth, then soon crossed the garden and ran towards the palace.

Long time passed after that, but Clay, who had entered the bush, did not show up again.

Like that, the sun went down and darkness fell.

Meow.

A cat’s cry tore through the silence of the night and echoed.

*****

“I’ve finally became able to formally greet you, sir.”

“Yes. This took much longer time than we expected.”

Roan and Manus sat inside a simple reception room and chatted.

After their chance meeting at the street, the two were able to meet two days after that.

Manus bashfully smiled and showed an apologetic look.

“Because there were too many places calling me here and there, I simply wasn’t able to make any time. I apologize.”

“Yes. It should be quite a busy time for you, sir.”

Roan cheerily smiled and shook his hand as if to say it’s okay.

‘It’s all because of Prince Reitas’ ploy……’

The light in his eyes instantly settled down.

‘Prince Reitas is intentionally impeding the meeting between Prince Manus and me.’

This was the truth that he found out through the spy report in the last few days.

For now, only that much was for certain.

‘Clay has been working hard.’

Regardless of his values, right now, he was doing his utmost for Roan.

“Anyway, the Istel Kingdom troops seemed to shake and tremble whenever the story about the Crimson Ghost came up.”

“It’s all an empty name.”

At Manus’ words, Roan faintly smiled and shook his head.

“Rather, I was greatly surprised. To think you would defeat the Byron and Istel’s allied army alone. You really are amazing.”

“There wasn’t much that I did. It was all thanks to the soldiers who fought well.”

This time, Manus smiled as he shook his head.

For a time, the two shared stories about wars and battles.

At first, it was about the war between the Pershion Kingdom, the Byron Kingdom, and the Istel allied army, and then the story about the Rinse Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom’s war followed.

“Oh! So the information troop’s part was truly great in assaulting the supply storage.”

At the utility of the information that decided the outcome of the war, Manus showed a great interest.

Due to that, the stories naturally began to center around Roan.

From the numerous monster expeditions before the war with the Istel Kingdom to the recent Poskein Exodus and the suppression of Elton Coat’s rebellion, various stories of wars and battles continued.

“It’s truly amazing. To think you would think up an idea to use a fleet in that situation. And the tactic of dividing the legion in half and disguising them as the enemy troop too is amazing.”

Each time Manus heard the stories, he greatly exclaimed in awe.

In this process, Roan thought that he was quite similar to himself.

‘Despite being a royalty, he doesn’t discriminate between people.’

It was as if watching someone of a commoner background.

A feeling of becoming calm and openness.

That was also the same for Manus.

‘His outstanding talent is one thing, but the person himself is truly great.’

Perhaps because he was a noble from a commoner background, he had no prejudice when facing a person.

Most of all, the two people both understood that people were the most important thing.

Furthermore.

“Baron Tale. When I was experiencing the war this time and constructing camps……”

“That really is an interesting idea. From what I know, in the Estia Empire’s tactics division……”

Even the figures of Roan and Manus deeply studying and analyzing topics that most royalty and nobles would consider below them were the same.

“Then for this……”

“Instead like this……”

Thanks to that, the pleasant conversation continued on without heed of the passing of the time.

In no time, darkness settled outside the reception room.

“Hahaha! Today truly was fun. I didn’t notice the time passing.”

Manus opened his shoulders wide and blossom a laugh.

“Yes. It really was an enjoyable time to me as well.”

It wasn’t simply fun.

Through the various conversations over numerous topics, there were much that he had learned or realized.

The two heartily laughed for a while, and then stared straight at each other’s face.

For a moment, a silent flowed.

The first one to spoke up was Roan.

“Prince Manus. I look forwards to working with you.”

They were sudden and unexpected words.

But Manus cheerfully smiled and shook Roan’s hand.

“Same here.”

Roan and Manus’ gazes fiercely met.

Roan’s plan to somehow form friendship with Manus succeeded extremely easily.

There wasn’t any need for complicated schemes or petty tricks.

The two people’s hearts resonated and they both felt a strong pull towards each other.

That was simply what fate was.

But suddenly, Roan had a certain thought.

‘Then was it not meant to be in the last life?’

He definitely thought that he was reliving the same life.

But could a fate change?

Tangled thoughts filled his head.

But Roan soon shook his head.

‘Whatever it may be, it’s fine just to have met a good person.’

Now was simply a time to be honestly happy and rejoice.

*****

“Is that so? So they ultimately met……”

Reitas rubbed the tip of his chin with one hand and frowned.

Roan and Manus’ meeting was immediately reported to Reitas’ ears.

Already, he had planted significant number of spies in Manus’ mansion and its surrounding.

‘Well, it doesn’t matter anymore whether Baron Tale’s goal is friendship with Manus or not.’

Reitas fingered the letter, that he had put on top of the table, with the tip of his fingers.

A letter from a friend living far away.

‘Kallum. I will proceed with the work as you have asked.’

The sender of the letter was in fact Rinse Kingdom’s Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

A sinister smile hung from Reitas’ mouth.

‘You will be the Rinse Kingdom’s next king, and I will become the Pershion Kingdom’s next king.’

In the letter that Kallum had sent, it was written to help each other for that purpose.

It wasn’t a bad deal from Reitas’ position.

Also.

Most of all, Kallum’s offer was something that Reitas could never refuse.

In truth, Roan was someone who didn’t matter at all from Reitas’ position.

For him, it was a situation where he just needed to take Manus’ life, who could endanger his throne.

But the suspicions that he would receive when that happens.

The suspicion that the older brother had killed his younger brother, that was the very problem.

If he killed Manus, that suspicion would forever follow him like a tail.

‘Kallum, you truly are amazing.’

Reitas mouthed a vicious smile.

On Kallum’s letter, a method that he hadn’t even thought of was written down.

‘Erase both Roan’s group and Manus, and fabricate Roan as a foreign spy who came to assassinate Manus!’

The dead speak no words.

In short, it was to blame all the crime on Roan.

Various schemes quickly passed through Reitas’ head.

Just in time, a good idea appeared.

The smile that hung from his mouth turned darker.

“Katz. I’m opening an emergency meeting. Pass the summons.”

At Reitas’ words, the head butler Baronet Katz Hamner quickly exited the office.

A moment later, Baron Baite Inges, who acted as his close aide, as well as numerous nobles and commanders gathered one after another.

Reitas moved the location to the meeting room, then explained Roan and Manus’ current situation.

“Now that the two have met, we cannot delay the time any further.”

Reitas placed Kallum’s letter on the table and formed a vicious smile.

“There is no need to worry of the consequences.”

With slightly tense looks, they all gulped.

Reitas glanced through them and spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Now, I will share the plan with you.”

It was a somewhat icy voice.

“I plan to make Roan Tale the assassinator of Manus.”

“Ah……!”

Quiet exclamations leaked out from here and there.

For a while, frightening schemes were spread out.

Gulp.

Every nobles and commanders gulped with nervous looks.

Reitas, who had finished his story, looked around at them and shrugged.

“What do you think?”

Baron Baite Inges answered faster than others.

“It, it’s excellent, sir!”

“It’s good.”

“If it goes according to the plan, everything should become perfect.”

The nobles and the commanders echoed a moment late.

Reitas widely smiled and nodded his head.

“Good. Since a rough outline has been made, do try and set up a proper plan. Since we have to finish the work before Roan Tale leaves.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The nobles and the commanders smiled sinisterly as they lowered their heads.

At that moment, a black shadow reflected through the window outside Reitas’ meeting room.

Flinch.

Everyone abruptly turned their heads.

The most swift one amongst the commanders opened the window and looked outside.

Meow.

With a quiet noise, a cat ran away on top of the windowsill.

At that sight, the commander exhaled a short sigh.

“It was a cat.”

His voice was as if it was trivial.

But Reitas instead turned with a stiff face towards the mage that was sitting with them.

Understanding Reitas’ meaning, he soon shook his head.

“It isn’t it. There is no smell of a druid. It probably was really just a cat.”

“Then that’s good……”

With a slightly relieved look, Reitas nodded his head.

After learning of the fact that one of Roan’s group named Clay was a druid, it became a situation where he doubted every animal.

Reitas pushed down on the table and stood up from his seat.

“Good. Then all of you each devote yourself to your mission.”

“Yes. Understood.”

All of them answered in one voice as they lowered their heads.

Reitas looked at them and whispered in a quiet voice.

“If I become the king, I will grant all of you high peerages and expansive fiefs.”

The instant he spoke those words, the faces of those who were within the room glowed red.

A powerful authority and incredible wealth.

If they could make Reitas the king, they could grasp it all.

The air of viscid greed and ambition blew.

*****

After their last meeting, there were more times when Roan and Manus spent together.

In that time, they discussed through all sorts of subjects including personal works as well as politics, economy, society, strategy, tactics, and more.

Today as well, Roan went to Manus the instant the day brightened.

“Baron Tale! You’ve also come early today. Then should we first have a cup of tea?”

Manus warmly smiled and welcomed Roan.

It was the same look as always.

Usually, Roan would brightly smile here and ask for latua tea.

But for some reason, Roan’s expression today was horribly dark.

“Prince.”

“Yes?”

At Roan’s serious face that he had never seen until now, Manus formed a worried look.

In a quiet voice, Roan spoke as if to whisper.

“There is something I have to tell you privately.”

“Hhm. Understood.”

Instead of asking what it is, Manus slowly nodded his head and called away the people near them.

The two headed to Manus’ office.

Tap. Tap.

The steps sounded unusually loud today.

“Did something happen?”

Manus sat down on one side and cautiously asked.

Roan couldn’t easily answer and quietly stared at Manus’ face.

‘I’ve contemplated for days whether I should tell him or not, but……’

He couldn’t reach a clear decision.

But.

‘It’s already the third day since I received Clay’s report. If I hesitate any longer, Prince Manus will be in danger.’

In the end, he could only say it.

This wasn’t a rational decision but an emotional one.

Roan stared straight into Manus’ eyes.

“Prince.”

“Yes. Please speak.”

As if to say he is ready to hear any words, Manus made a faint smile.

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

“How much do Prince Manus trust Prince Reitas?”

“Yes?”

Instantly, Manus’ expression froze stiff.

The smile that hung from his mouth disappeared as if wiped clean.

With a greatly twisted face, he stared at Roan.

No, he glared.

Until now, he hadn’t seen Manus’ face like this.

Roan once again let out a short sigh.

“Prince. Right now, Prince Reitas is……”

When he spoke up to that point.

Boom.

Manus suddenly stood up from his seat.

Roan stared at Manus with a slightly shocked expression.

Manus looked straight at Roan and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Please leave now.”

“Yes?”

When Roan asked back, Manus abruptly shouted aloud.

“I said please leave now!”

“Prince. But please listen to my……”

“I do not want to hear it.”

Manus cut off his words and walked up in front of the door.

He opened the office door and stepped aside.

It was a clear order to leave.

Roan tried to speak up again, but saw Manus’ expression and closed his mouth.

Manus’ expression was greatly complicated.

Anger, sadness, emptiness, despair……

The unpleasant emotions were chaotically mixed together.

But amongst them, Roan could feel one emotion clearly.

‘He is sorry.’

Because of that, he couldn’t bring out up any more words.

Roan slowly moved his steps and went out of the office.

Boom.

As if it was waiting, the door closed.

The wind pushed Roan’s back.

As if to say to hurry and go.

“Huu.”

Roan exhaled out a long sign.

The inside of his head was disheveled.

At that moment, he couldn’t understand Manus’ reaction.

‘The situation is……’

His lips parched drily.

‘Flowing badly.’

That at least was certain.

But even so, he couldn’t give up.

It wasn’t as if there was no other way.

‘For now, I should knock against it.’

Roan tightly clenched his fist and moved his steps.

Tap. Tap.

The steps echoed through the corridor.

Much louder than before.

Chapter 143




T/n (CSV): Regular chapter for Sunday. The sponsored chapter should soon follow sometime tomorrow.

The history was no different than a board with perfectly set process and result.

Although he didn’t knew it at the time, seemingly insignificant things often were the cause or the starting point of incredibly great events in retrospect.

And when such seemingly insignificant things and seemingly unrelated things pile up and up, they soon become the history.

‘The thing called history is much bigger and heavier than I had thought.’

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

He wanted to shake that perfectly set board called history.

No, to be exact, he wished to flip the board that would become history.

‘Prince Reitas cannot become the Pershion Kingdom’s king like in the last life.’

Because of that, he tried to save Manus Pershion.

‘Prince Manus doesn’t have to become the next king. But at least, he has to……’

When his thought reached that point.

“He didn’t even try to listen, sir?”

Harrison and Brian asked with slightly shocked faces.

Roan nodded instead of answering.

On the other hand, Clay had a rather composed look.

“If he had that much reaction to the words asking how much he trusts Prince Manus……”

He spoke in an indifferent voice.

“Then it must mean that Prince Manus has already recognized on his own the complex problem between himself and Prince Reitas.”

“As expected, is it so……”

Roan made a bitter smile and exhaled a short sigh.

The mood became heavy.

Clay, who had been still, opened his mouth with a little odd expression.

“My lord. This is something I wish to tell you now that the situation has became like this, and in truth, I had a one point of question ever since when I first heard of the work this time.”

Roan quietly stared at Clay as if to to tell him to say it.

Clay faintly smiled and continued his words.

“If the goal was for the principle of befriending a faraway nation and attacking the ones near, the current situation is enough. Although Pershion’s king is incompetent and the friendship between Prince Reitas and Prince Kallum is close, the ones who reconnected the severed connection between the two nations are us. Anyone and everyone will recognize that deed.”

This was the truth.

The incompetent Pershion King had granted them a letter with a content about strengthening the two countries’ friendship. This was because the royalty as well as many nobles felt danger at the Byron Kingdom and Istel Kingdom’ invasion this time.

As Clay had said, the situation was such that they would have raised big merit even if they returned right at that moment.

“There’s no need to go out of our way and be so concerned for an utter stranger, and especially for Prince Manus who is a prince of a foreign kingdom. Furthermore, Prince Reitas is currently aiming for lord’s life as well. Although Prince Manus’ situation is pitiable, our lord’s safety is more important from our position. I think it would be better for us to step back at this point and return to our kingdom.”

At those words, Harrison and Brian nodded their heads.

According to Clay’s intelligence, Reitas planned to ask Roan for an academy lecture.

Of course, that was a trap.

‘Also……’

Roan’s interest in Manus was on the excessive side.

Because his talent is outstanding?

Even so, he was a foreign kingdom’s prince.

From Rinse Kingdom’s position, he was an existence that could turn into an enemy at any time.

Clay’s words continued.

“With this much, even Prince Simon would be satisfied. If Prince Manus reacted that violently, then let us leave at this point. If we stay any longer, we may be done in by Prince Reitas’ side.”

At those words, Roan slowly shook his head.

“No. We must save him.”

His voice was calm but resolute.

Slightly creasing his brows, Clay cautiously asked.

“Is there perhaps another goal, sir?”

“That……”

Roan looked back and forth between Clay, Harrison, and Brian, then spoke in a quiet voice.

“I will tell you at a later date. Now, now isn’t the time just yet.”

“Hmm.”

Clay leaked a quiet groan.

On the other hand, Harrison and Brian slowly nodded their heads and then no longer held any interest.

Looking at them, Roan inwardly exhaled a sigh.

‘I can’t just thoughtlessly tell them about the future, and……’

A slightly complicated look reflexed on his face.

‘Once Prince Reitas climbs onto the throne, the next is Prince Kallum Rinse’s turn.’

The decisive reason that the third prince Kallum Rinse was able to step ahead of the two older brothers and climb to the throne.

That was because that there was Reitas’ help.

Reitas, who rose to the throne ahead of Kallum, extensively supported and backed his friend Kallum.

‘I didn’t quite realize it in the last life, but now that I looked at it……’

That was a very well-set up board.

When Reitas became the Pershion Kingdom’s king, Kallum used the principle of befriending a faraway nation and attacking the ones near.

No, in truth, that was closer to a military alliance.

Together with Reitas, Kallum attacked the Byron Kingdom from the South and the West and took tens of castles.

Word for word, it was an incredible military achievement.

‘As Prince Kallum won again and again in the war with the Byron Kingdom, Duke Francis Wilson, who had been a neutral faction, joined Prince Kallum’s faction.’

For generations, Duke Wilson’s house held incredible hostility towards the Byron Kingdom.

Especially in case of Francis, his hostility was incited especially greatly because his father had fallen in a war with the Byron Kingdom.

‘Prince Kallum could only look pleasant in his eyes.’

Ultimately, the balance between the kingdom’s four dukes fell, and the throne succession competition leaned towards Kallum.

‘And with Prince Tommy suddenly dying and King Reitas Pershion on a winning streak, the throne ultimately became Prince Kallum’s.’

And Simon became the Mad Monarch.

‘And if we look at Prince Reitas and Prince Manus’ current situation……’

It felt as if Manus and Tommy’s deaths were deeply related to Reitas and Kallum.

Manus’ death, Reitas’ ascension to the throne, Kallum’s meteoric rise, Tommy’s death, Kallum’s ascension to the throne.

And.

The Great Warring Era.

It felt as if the things that seemed seamlessly unrelated from a glance, the events that Roan hadn’t noticed in the last life were all twisted together as one.

It literally was an excellently set board.

And that became the history.

‘If Prince Kallum becomes the next king, I will be driven to a corner.’

There is no reason for him to keep Roan, who as Simon’s close aide, alive.

No, he was already trying to kill him.

‘I must keep Prince Manus alive.’

Manus’ death that became the starting point of everything.

He aimed to stop that.

He aimed to flip the history from the last life.

‘And……’

The light in Roan’s eyes calmly settled down.

There was one more reason that he was trying to save Manus.

‘If I will stay as Prince Simon’s subordinate, Prince Manus may not be necessary. Since I just need to check Prince Kallum like now. But for me to become a monarch……’

He needed Manus.

Roan’s dream was a monarch of a kingdom.

‘With the current situation, I should shape up a foundation with the Tale fief as the center.’

Meaning that if he ultimately raised up a country, he could only clash with the Rinse Kingdom.

Whether that was through a just process or treason, or whether that the person he clashed against is Simon, Tommy, or Kallum.

To Roan, Rinse Kingdom was a wall that he had to one day overcome.

‘The moment I raise a nation, the surrounding kingdoms will all thoroughly become enemy nations.’

If the situation became so, there would be a limit to finding a collaborator within the Rinse Kingdom.

And the situations for Istel Kingdom and Byron Kingdom were obvious.

Once it became a war of a kingdom against a kingdom, a monarch against a monarch, he needed an appropriate reinforcement.

To Roan, Manus was someone who had the possibility of becoming that very such collaborator.

‘The most outstanding person amongst those who I can currently form friendship with.’

Everything was a preparative move for the future.

A preparatory move for a future called a monarch.

Of course, he didn’t knew that the situation would flow like this.

It was truly an incredible danger.

But if he thought of it differently, it was also an incredible opportunity.

‘If I could just turn this issue around, the position of the Pershion Kingdom’s future monarch would be Prince Manus’ to take.’

Once he organized his thoughts, an even more resolute determination arose.

‘I must save Prince Manus.’

At that moment, he heard Clay’s voice.

“If you truly must save Prince Manus that much, we would need to hurry, my lord. It seems like Prince Reitas’ side is almost done with their preparations, you see.”

“Hmm.”

With a quiet groan, Roan nodded his head.

“I can only go back and meet him again.”

“Sir, you are going to go meet him again even though you’ve been chased out like that?”

Harrison slightly frowned.

To him, Roan was more important than Manus.

Roan faintly smiled and stood up from his seat.

“Something like face isn’t important when saving a person.”

“But my lord……”

Harrison and Brian called out to Roan with stiff expressions.

Roan nodded as if to say it’s okay, then turned to Clay.

“Clay. You watch Prince Reitas’ movements a bit more meticulously.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Clay lightly lowered his head.

Roan then moved his steps out of the office.

As the situation was such, he had to go find Manus once again.

When he just came out of the residence.

“Un?”

Roan’s eyes opened widely.

Outside the door, a familiar face could be seen.

“Prince Manus……”

The young man who was standing still in the darkness was Prince Manus Pershion.

Roan quickly lowered his head.

Manus, who was looking at Roan with a complicated expression, slowly approached and lowered his head.

“I’m sorry about what happened in the morning.”

His voice was quiet and deeply heavy.

As if he had resolved on something, he exhaled a long sigh and then spoke in a quiet voice.

“The story Baron Tale was going to say…… let me hear it.”

*****

‘Someone like me would’ve been better if I was a fool.’

From when he was young, Manus had such thought.

He cursed his preeminent talent.

The reason was simple.

‘Brother, my older brother Reitas is slowly distancing himself from me.’

As a member of royalty, and especially as a prince who was second in line to the throne succession, Manus was aware that his great talent would become a seed of conflict.

It was something unrelated to his own desire.

‘If I showed a great talent, people who follow me will definitely appear.’

A faction would be formed if people gathered, and tragic things, completely regardless of Manus’ will, would happen if a faction was formed.

That would also include that Reitas.

In the end, a situation where brothers who loved and cared for each other point their swords towards each other would arise.

‘To avoid such situation, I had lived a life where I only read books and went on trips.’

He didn’t went out of his way to show off his ability.

He also had no interest in politics or authority.

He simply wished to cheer his brother Reitas on and live a quiet and peaceful life.

But as the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom invaded, that dream was shattered into dust.

‘Since I couldn’t watch the sight of the kingdom falling down just to hide my talent.’

In the end, Manus went past the nobles who only voiced for surrender, led a legion by himself, and went on a counterattack.

He went through the west and the south and perfectly defeated the invading army.

As he wished, he saved the kingdom.

But because of that, he earned the fame, people, and power that he didn’t desire.

And.

‘As I had worried, I lost my brother.’

He strived to heal their relationship.

He ignored numerous offers and vows of loyalty from nobles and commanders.

In congratulatory celebrations and various banquets, he only showed his face and exited.

Instead, he went around the castle and lived along with the commoners.

Although he did form friendship with Roan due to a fated and strong pull, he avoided everything that his brother Reitas may be guarded against.

‘Of course, I knew that even so, I could never be close to my brother ever again.’

He was also aware that his brother Reitas’ guard had became even more intense.

But even so, he hadn’t expected even the situation that Roan had just told.

“Th, that’s ridiculous.”

The end of Manus’ voice shook.

His head felt dizzy.

Looking at Manus’ face that turned white, Roan spoke in a calm voice.

“It may be hard to believe, but it’s all true.”

“Hmm.”

Manus leaned his head on his right hand as he closed his eyes.

In a completely dispirited state, he murmured as if to whisper.

“I knew that brother was guarded against me. But only to that much. It’s just that we’ve became a bit far apart. Never, brother would never……”

Manus opened the eyes he had closed and stared at Roan.

“He would never kill me.”

Although he had spat out the words, his heart greatly shook.

It was a situation where even he wasn’t sure.

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

“Prince Manus, please listen well. When tomorrow lights up, Prince Reitas will probably call you quickly. And he would request you to go as a expedition commander to the villages in the Northeast region because monsters are attacking the villages.”

“An expedition commander?”

“Yes. It would be a request to go as a commander to command the regional troop of the Northeastern corp. And……”

Roan’s story continued on for a while.

But Manus would only continue to shake his head.

“Even so, I can’t believe it.”

That was a kind of defiance and rejection.

No, it was a vain hope that he wished to believe so.

“Ah! Could it perhaps be that corrupt nobles near older brother Reitas had incited him? Right, that should be right. This must be something that they had closed brother’s eyes and ears and schemed on their own.”

The vain hope paralyzed his reason.

‘His feelings for his brother were this deep.’

With a regrettable expression, Roan exhaled a short sigh.

“Okay. Then let us act like this.”

To persuade Manus, he spread out a new plan.

Manus, who had heard the entire story, nodded his head with a slightly tense look.

“Alright. Let’s do as Baron Tale said.”

“Thank you very much.”

At the success that he finally reached after a long talk, Roan exhaled a sigh of relief.

Once all the story was done, Manus stood up from his seat.

“Hhm.”

Momentarily, he lost his balance and stumbled.

The psychological shock was that great.

“Your highness, are you okay?”

Roan quickly supported Manus.

Manus tapped the back of Roan’s hand that held his arm.

“Baron Tale.”

“Yes. Prince.”

When Roan replied, Manus quietly murmured in a completely dispirited voice.

“I wish that our plan will become something pointless tomorrow. No, I wish there won’t be a call from older brother Reitas tomorrow. No……”

His expression was sorrowful.

“I wish that tomorrow wouldn’t come.”

Roan couldn’t say anything.

He could only, quietly, stand and support Manus.

LIke that, the two hushed their breathing as they stared at the passing time.

*****

“Is that true?”

Reitas made a slightly surprised look.

Baron Baite Inges, who acted as his close aide, brightly smiled as he nodded his head.

“Yes. Baron Tale said that he wished to participate in the monster subjugation expedition instead of participating in an academy lecture.”

“Hhm.”

Reitas nodded his head with a slightly odd expression.

The things were flowing in a direction he hadn’t even thought of.

‘I had requested him for an academy lecture because asking Roan Tale, who is a foreign diplomat from another kingdom, to participate in the subjugation expedition was too willful, but……’

While asking Manus for the role of commander to the regional troop of the Northeastern corp, he had separately requested Roan for a special lecture at the Distou Academy.

Distou Academy, located about a half a day away northeast of the capital, Althus Castle, it was the best academy in the Pershion Kingdom.

Because it was located deep within mountains for the academy students’ study, it wasn’t easily accessible.

‘I planned to take care of Roan Tale and Manus separately and then tie them together to disguise it as an assassination, but……’

Thanks to Roan choosing to participate in the expedition rather than the special lecture, the work actually became easier.

Reitas faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Good. Send him a good horse and an armor, and pass on a message thanking him.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Baite cheerfully smiled as he immediately exited the office.

Reitas stared at the sunlight pouring down through the office’s window outside.

“The winter sun is truly nice.”

His voice was somewhat elated.

The smile that hung on his mouth became slightly thicker.

“Is the hazy throne becoming slightly clearer……”

His heart raced.

It felt as if an enormous wall that stood in front of his eyes had disappeared.

“Manus. Forgive this brother.”

He resolved to kill him and even raised a plan to kill him.

And today, he would carry out the plan.

Although he had intentionally and firmly resolved himself, it couldn’t be helped that a corner of his heart ached quietly.

But even so, he had no plan to stop.

Reitas couldn’t take his eyes off the sunlight that poured down.

Outside the window, there wasn’t a speck of cloud in the sky.

Without even a small movement, he sat on his seat.

He only waited for a happy news.

Like that, the time passed and passed again.

The sun that was in the east leaned towards the west.

But from the window facing the south, the sunlight still continued to pour down.

At that moment.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

With a sound of knocking on the office door, Baite appeared.

His face was slightly elated.

He hesitated for a moment, then carefully opened his mouth.

“A news that the work was successfully carried out arrived. Would you like to depart now?”

It was the news that he waited and waited for so.

But for a while, Reitas didn’t answered.

With his eyes still full of turbulent light, he was looking at the winter sunlight.

“Prince. Should we simply tell them to transport the corpse here?”

Baite once again asked carefully.

Reitas only then faintly smiled and shook his head.

“No. We should do according to the plan. I’ll depart now.”

“Yes. Then I will have the horses ready.”

Baite lowered his head and then exited the office.

Reitas, who was left alone, slowly stood up from his seat.

His eyes were still on the sunlight.

With a quiet voice, he murmured as if to whisper.

“At least, it’s good that the day he left isn’t cold.”

Reitas inhaled deeply, then slowly moved his feet.

A step, a step.

With each step, his face full of smile blossomed.

‘It’s a step I’ve already made.’

He made the decision.

The consequence following the decision was also something that he had to carry.

‘I cannot stop or go back now that I’ve come this far.’

In the first place, he wouldn’t have even started if his resolve was only that much.

His steps became faster.

Exiting the office, he unhesitantly stepped towards the mansion’s front door.

Strong steps as if he would never stop.

Reitas clenched his fist.

‘I will become the Pershion’s king.’

In front of the throne, ties of blood were insignificant.

His eyes were already blinded by authority.

Veiled Strife (3) End.

Chapter 144




T/n (CSV): Sponsored chapter.

Update: ch. 145 will be a bit late.

Compared to how the Pershion Kingdom’s western and southern regions suffered damage from the chaos of the war, the situation at the northeastern region was on a bit better side.

But even so, it wasn’t always a peaceful place either.

This was because various monsters thrived around the widely spread forest.

Due to that, Pershion Kingdom had a separate regional troop that undertook monster subjugation.

But with the Byron and Istel Kingdom’s invasion, the regional commanders who oversaw the monster subjugation were all transferred to the front line and a gap was created.

Through that gap, the monsters were attacking the northeastern region’s villages.

This was the very false situation that Prince Reitas Pershion convinced Prince Manus Pershion of.

“It’s over the hill on the right, sir.”

Baron Baites Inges spoke with a slightly nervous look.

He didn’t particularly say what was there.

Since either way, Reitas would also know.

Clop. Clop.

The sound of horse hooves rode the northern wind and spread.

About twenty knights followed Reitas and Baites’ back.

“Hhm.”

Reitas, who climbed up onto the hill, leaked out a quiet groan.

Even though it was something he had already resolved himself plenty for, the sight that spread out beyond the hill stabbed his eyes and tore through his heart.

‘Manus……’

The corpse lying face down on the ground.

Although there were several corpses next to it, Reitas was instantly able to recognize Manus.

He slowly went down to the bottom of the hill.

His gaze was stuck on Manus’ back.

Clank.

Getting down from his horse, he moved his feet.

A slightly distanced spot from Manus.

He couldn’t go closer than that.

“Manus.”

The end of his voice shook.

“Hhm.”

Reitas needlessly coughed once and stared straight at Manus’ back.

“I had no choice but to kill you.”

It was an unavoidable choice.

“I was born to be a king and lived to become a king. To such me, you were an insurmountable wall and an unbearable pain.”

And so, he could only destroy it.

“It would’ve been better instead if you weren’t born……”

They were words streaked with his innermost feelings.

With a short sigh, Reitas shook his head and raised his right hand.

“Collect Roan Tale’s corpse and Manus’ corpse. We will disguise it as if a foreign noble had assassinated Manu……”

The moment he spoke up to that point.

Rustle.

Reitas doubted his eyes.

Manus’ corpse that was lying with its face on the ground intensely shook.

“Uuh!”

“Wha, what the!”

Baite as well as the knights behind him became startled and yelled.

That is to say, Reitas hadn’t seen it incorrectly.

“Just what is……”

With a frown, Reitas stared at Manus’ corpse.

Rustle. Rustle.

Manus’ corpse shook up and down several times, then pushed up the ground with two hands and stood up.

That was not a corpse.

“Older brother Reitas.”

The quiet and troubled voice was definitely Manus’.

Standing straight on two feet, he stared at Reitas’ face.

“You really……”

He looked as if he was suppressing a burning thing within his chest.

“Tried to killed me.”

He didn’t believe it.

He didn’t want to believe it.

But everything was revealed to be true.

“Huu.”

Manus exhaled a long sigh.

“How are you alive?”

Reitas frowned as he asked.

Although he was momentarily taken back, he soon regained his composure.

“That is……”

When Manus had spoken to that point.

Rustle. Rustle.

The corpses that were spread around all moved up and down.

“Huugh!”

“What!”

Baite and the knights gasped at that sight.

A moment later, Roan and Clay as well as the young commanders who escort Manus brushed dirt off their clothes and stood up.

Amongst them, there was not a single person dead.

No, there wasn’t even anyone who was hurt.

The blood on their clothes were surely of other people’s.

Seeing that sight, Reitas formed a bitter smile.

“It seems I’ve thought too easily of you. Manus.”

Manus shook his head at those words.

Turning around to Roan, he opened his mouth.

“No. Instead of me, brother underestimated Baron Tale. Since this is all his work.”

Already, there was strength in his voice.

“Hmm.”

At those words, Reitas looked at Roan with a quiet groan.

Roan quietly stared back at that burning gaze.

‘In the end, it became like this.’

In the end, Manus’ wish wasn’t realized.

Suddenly, he heard Manus’ voice.

“Did you really have to do it like this?”

“Yes. This was the best.”

Reitas calmly replied.

For a moment, Manus clenched his teeth, then spoke as if to spit out each and every word.

“If brother asked me to disappear, I would’ve done it. If you told me to live as if I was dead because I’m getting in the way and bothering you, I would have done it.”

In the first place, he had no interest in politics or authority.

If Reitas wanted it, he would had done it like so.

Reitas quietly stared at Manus, and then slowly shook his head.

“That’s living like one was dead, not dead.”

He widely opened his arms.

“Manus. You are truly brilliant and have an incredible talent, but you in fact know nothing of politics and authority. You’ll live as if you are dead? Then do you think everything will be solved? Far from it.”

Reitas’ voice slowly became bigger.

“The faction that supports you will await your return. They’ll increase their power, strengthen their foundation, and struggle to place you at the top of authority. They may even point their swords at me.”

“That’s just a conclusion brother arbitrarily thought and came to.”

Manus creased his brows.

At those words, Reitas made a faint smile.

In a quiet voice, he spoke as if to whisper.

“Manus. The people of the world are a lot closer to me than you. They obsess over things like authority, wealth, and honor. It means that even if you act noble by yourself, the things around you will ultimately create a mess.”

Reitas pointed at Manus.

“As long as you live, the seed of strife won’t disappear. As well as the unease and powerlessness that suffocate me……”

He took two steps back.

At the same time, the knights who were lined up behind him walked forwards.

On Manus’ side, there were only about ten with Roan and the young commanders together.

Compared to him, the knights numbered more than twenty.

“Older brother Reitas.”

Manus was calm.

“I wished to believe in brother. But that belief was amusingly shattered like this.”

A light circled in his eyes.

That was a cold and hard light.

It wasn’t the light of Manus who lived soft and complacently saying good things are good.

“You were anxious because of my talent? That I was an insurmountable wall? So you could only kill me?”

He looked straight into Reitas’ eyes.

“Don’t say such cowardly words.”

“What?”

Reitas unknowingly asked back.

It was that he was slightly flustered since this side of Manus was a first.

Manus continued his words.

“Light Kingdom’s founder Madison Von Light had five younger brothers below him. They were all excellent individuals. Especially the third younger brother Plapp was much greater genius than King Madison. Then did King Madison kill him? Far from it. King Madison gave Plapp the command right to command the entire army. After that, Plapp led that army, led countless wars and battles to victory, and set up the foundation for the Light Kingdom to be found.”

“That is……”

When Reitas tried to say something.

“Brother.”

Manus cut him off.

Fire flickered in his eyes.

“Brother isn’t fit to become the king.”

“For you to say something like that, amusing.”

Reitas snorted.

Not minding that, Manus continued to speak.

“Could a man afraid of his own brother lead a country? That’s what is truly amusing.”

The words became a thorn and pierced Reitas’ chest.

Manus looked at Reitas with an expression full of pity.

Reitas couldn’t take that expression and look.

Reitas temperamentally shouted.

“Manus. Die already!”

Irritation soared.

Although he had seen through the trap and survived, the opportunity was still there.

If he were to definitely end the things now at least, there won’t be any problems.

“So you’ll kill me after all?”

“Now, we cannot turn back.”

At Manus’ question, Reitas answered shortly.

“Huu.”

Manus let out a short sigh.

“Where could brother’s soldiers waiting to ambush and kill me and Baron Tale have gone?”

A suddenly thrown question.

Unexpectedly, Reitas answered with a calm look.

“You guys probably took care of them.”

As soon as he said those words, a hill rising up to their right became uproarious.

“Prince!”

“My lord!”

The thing that suddenly appeared without a commonplace troop flag was a single troop with Harrison and Brian at the head.

The troop, made up of about five hundred soldiers, had been hiding themselves after cleaning up Reitas’ soldiers who were waiting in ambush.

“Our side’s soldiers number over five hundred.”

Manus spoke in a coldly composed voice.

“Brother has no more chance.”

At those words, Reitas shook his head.

“No, the chance is still there. Since I could kill you before they come down the hill.”

“Try it if you can. Since I don’t have any thought of stepping back anymore than this.”

His expression and voice were resolved.

Manus had thrown away the vain hope that he held towards Reitas.

Reitas didn’t wait any longer and waved his right hand.

“Kill him.”

A cruel order fell.

Tat!

Twenty knights kicked the ground simultaneously.

Although the soldiers on top of the hill began to move a moment later, the distance was rather far.

“Die!”

The knights screamed and pounced.

At that moment.

Puuk!

Suddenly, a black and long pole hit the ground a step in front of them.

“Huugh!”

“Kuk!”

Two knights, who had been running fiercely, couldn’t quite dodge and rolled on the ground.

“Wha, what!”

With ferocious spirit, the knights glared with their eyes.

Suddenly, an elongated stick soar through the air and left behind an afterimage.

“Huugh!”

“Damn it!”

Dodging the pole stabbing through their gaps, the knights shook their body left and right.

Amongst them, there were some who swung their swords and parried the pole away.

Paat!

With a hazy afterimage, a young man stood in front of the knights.

The owner of the black pole.

He was Roan.

“I’m sorry, but the ones who will be dying aren’t us, but……”

He turned his wrist.

Chang.

At the tip of the black pole, a long spearhead shot up.

The Trivias Spear had revealed its full form.

“You.”

Tat!

The instant he finished his words, Roan kicked the ground.

The long spear that had tore through the knights’ gaps instantly shrunk.

“This bastard!”

“To dare to come at us alone!”

The knights thought that Roan was throwing around reckless courage.

Then.

Pat! Pavat!

In front of the knights’ eyes, a ball of light about two fingers big appeared.

“Kuugh!”

“Ugh!”

At the sudden situation, most of the knights squinted their eyes and turn their heads.

‘I’ve did it.’

Roan inwardly cheered.

It was because the light spell using the Brent’s ring had shown effectiveness even in a real fight.

Using the Kalian’s Tears to read the flows of knights’ mana, Roan shook his spear following them.

The sharp spearhead danced and pierced through the bodies of knights done in by the light spell.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

Death throes.

Four knights, without even offering a decent resistance, fell.

“Hhm.”

“Ah……”

Manus and the young commanders who followed him leaked out a quiet exclamation at the scene that suddenly happened.

They stared at Roan’s back that stood in front of them.

‘Is this the skill of the Crimson Ghost?’

‘What was that light just now?’

Gulp.

They subconsciously gulped.

They felt slightly confused.

Roan of now was different than Roan they knew.

He was a person who always shared various stories of numerous subjects with a friendly smile.

He felt more closer to a scholar than a warrior.

But Roan of now was.

‘Emanating a thick smell of blood.’

‘This kind of pressure isn’t something that’s naturally made.’

It was an incredible pressure that could only be earned after walking through the battlefields for tens of years.

Right now, Roan was radiating such pressure from his entire body.

‘It feels suffocating even when I’m standing behind him.’

Manus fully opened his chest and breathed in.

Considering how he himself was feeling such pressure, Reitas’ knights in front of Roan must had been breathless.

Manus bitterly smiled and picked up a sword that was on the ground.

“Let’s start as well.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The young commanders quickly took up swords.

Moving their feet, they stood on Roan’s two sides.

Seeing this sight, Reitas flashed a cold light from his eyes.

“We don’t need the others. Focus only on killing Manus.”

“Yes!”

The knights answered in one voice and then kicked off the ground.

Glaring at the knights rushing towards them, Roan spoke in a quiet voice.

“Prince Manus. Will you be fine?”

“Yes. I have already resolved myself.”

Manus answered with a composed look.

Roan glanced at him and the young commanders once, then nodded his head.

“Then, should we put an end to this work?”

The instant his words ended, everyone kicked the ground.

Taat!

Roan and Manus as well as the young commanders and Reitas’ knights violently rushed at each other.

And finally.

Boom!

With an explosion, the two group merged with each other.

Chang! Chaang! Chang!

Sparks flew along with the metallic noises.

A tie.

Although the number on Roan and Manus’ side was much smaller, the overall situation was equal.

The reason was.

Spaat!

“Kuuk!”

Due to Manus of brilliant swordplay and.

Ssskuk!

“Kuugh!”

Roan of precise and destructive spearmanship.

As if they had matched themselves before, they showed a natural coordination and pressured on the knights.

And all the while, the troop, which was coming down the hill, was almost upon them.

Reitas moved his gaze away from the chaotic battle spreading in front of his eyes and looked up at the blue sky.

‘The winter sun is still nice.’

But it felt different than the sunlight he saw from the office window.

If the sunlight from then was warm, the sunlight of now was cold.

The northern wind tore through his clothes and entered.

It was cold.

Sseureng.

He pulled out the sword on his waist and slowly moved his feet.

His gaze was once again towards Manus.

‘I will personally cut off your neck with my own hands.’

If they just looked at their skills swordsmanship, Manus was a step, no several steps above him.

But.

‘You cannot cut me, but I can cut you down.’

However much he made up words pretending to be cold, Manus was Manus.

Reitas thought so.

Clenching his teeth, he kicked off the ground.

The target was solely Manus.

Then.

Spaat!

A light flashed and then a spearhead popped out in front of his nose.

“Kuk!”

With his teeth clench, Reitas swung his sword.

As if it had been waiting, the spearhead in front of his nose abruptly moved back.

Swuung.

The sword amusingly cut the air.

“Hhm.”

His balance broke.

The spearhead that had backed off suddenly approached once more.

Needless to say, the owner of the spear was Roan.

“This is the end.”

Roan shrunk Travias Spear’s length as he slowly approached.

Reitas looked straight into Roan’s eyes.

“Roan Tale. It seems the work has been spoiled because of you.”

Roan shook his head at those words.

“The thing that ruined your work is that squalid ambition of yours.”

“There is nothing squalid to ambition. It merely burns.”

Reitas put strength into the grip holding the sword.

He stared behind Roan at Manus, who was pressuring away the knights.

“Don’t intervene in a sibling affair.”

Reitas had a work he had to finish.

Roan twisted his wrist as he straightened his stance.

A cold smile hung from his mouth.

“Then in the first place, you shouldn’t have involved me in a sibling affair.”

He looked absolutely without a sign of stepping back.

Reitas stared straight into Roan’s two eyes and clenched his teeth.

And then.

“Roan Tale!”

Shouting at the top of his lungs, he kicked the ground.

The anger and despair he had been forcefully suppressing had exploded out at once.

Reitas’ sword cut through the space with an incredible pressure.

“I’m not naive enough……”

Roan smoothly moved his feet and quickly whipped his arms.

“To lose to an opponent who lost his calm, sir.”

Simultaneously, the spearhead jumped up as if flicked.

A light flashed between Roan and Reitas.

That was a light so blindingly bright and cold that it somehow felt even sad.

Veiled Strife (4) End.

Chapter 145




T/n (CSV): The much late chapter for Tuesday, June 20th.

A north wind blew.

At the place where a fierce battle occurred just a moment ago, a heavy silence fell.

Neither the sounds of metal nor shouts were heard any more.

Most of the knights who followed Prince Reitas Pershion had died during the battle, and few were captured alive.

Reitas, who had fought a decisive duel with Roan, was kneeling down with his eyes closed.

It was a complete defeat.

Reitas, who although may be lacking when compared to Manus but was also famed as a genius, was completely defeated in a duel with Roan.

Although the fault that he had lost his calm was also great, it also meant that Roan’s skills weren’t so trivial.

“P, pl, please let me live!”

The heavy silence broke.

The one who was yelling out aloud was Baron Baite Inges, who acted as Reitas’ close aide.

With his knees on the ground, he shouted with a desperate expression.

“I, I only did as I was ordered! Please let me live! If you just let me live, I’ll devote my entire body and swear my loyalty.”

He howled in a fussy manner.

Manus didn’t even glance at him once and lightly raised his left hand.

Soon, a young commander approached and hit Baite’s neck.

“Kuuk.”

Baite, who noisily clamored, lost his consciousness and fell.

Thanks to that, a heavy silence fell once more.

An unknown amount of time passed.

“How long do you plan to stay like this?”

This time, the one who broke the silence was Reitas.

Although he was kneeling, he didn’t lose his spirit at all and neither was his expression nervous.

Instead, there somehow was composure.

It felt as if a tightly pulled string had been relaxed.

Manus, who was absently standing amongst the people, stepped forwards and approached.

“Older brother Reitas. Everything is now ove……”

The moment he spoke up to that point.

“Kill me.”

Reitas spat out the words with a composed voice.

He slowly opened his eyes that he had closed, and stared at Manus’ face.

“Manus. If I remain alive, the nobles who followed me will seek the next chance. Kill me. That is the way of the victor and the fate of the loser.”

Reitas knew the bastard called authority very well.

But Manus was different.

“I’m different than brother.”

Everyone’s eyes turned towards Manus.

Roan was also amongst them.

‘Did his resolve perhaps weaken after coming this far?’

Although Roan always valued people the most, even he showed a cold-hearted and dispassionate look at least in battle.

Manus and Reitas.

This fight that fought over the throne was a more vicious war than any others.

If his resolve became weak and failed to put an end, he could leave behind a seed of great trouble.

But unlike Roan’s such worry, Manus’ expression was extremely hard and overflowing with strength.

It felt as if he had came to his own decision.

He stared straight into Reitas’ eyes.

“I won’t kill brother. Live, and properly see and feel. The sight of a true monarch.”

That was a kind of declaration.

A declaration greatly overflowing with determination and full of certainty.

“Hahahahahaha!”

Abruptly, Reitas exploded out a laugh.

He laughed for a long while, then shook his head with a cold and frigid face.

“Manus. You don’t know authority. I said it, if I remain alive, the nobles who followed me……”

At that moment.

“I……”

Manus cut off his words.

The light in his eyes ferociously burned.

“Will grant fitting peerage and rank to anyone, even if they are nobles who support brother, as long as they are talented and have excellent character.”

He tightly clenched his two fists.

“Not Manus’ party, not Reitas’ party, but Pershion’s party.”

A strength entered his voice.

“We will become one under the name of Pershion.”

The moment his words finished, Reitas shook his head.

“Idiot.”

An excessive idealism.

The guy who was perfect in everything else was much too ignorant when it came to politics and authority.

Clicking the tip of his tongue, he stared straight into Manus’ eyes.

“Fine. If you truly believe that, then I will stay alive and clearly watch your actions.”

His face was stiff.

“The day you regret will definitely come.”

Manus shook his head and returned the same words.

“The day of regret will definitely come. Not for me, but for older brother.”

The veiled strife was over.

Reitas who obsessed in power was disgraced, and instead, Manus who had no interest came to stand tall as the true power of the kingdom.

It was a completely unexpected event.

Regardless of whatever anyone said, the one who caused the biggest influence for the event to become like this was Roan.

‘I thought that it’ll be good even if he simply stayed alive……’

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

He had thought that it’ll be a success if Manus at least stayed alive and took on a role of checking Reitas.

But.

‘He became the sole successor.’

Moreover, Manus basically owed him a big favor.

Considering Manus’ personality, he would never lightly pass this away.

‘We ended up receiving a greater present than we’ve thought’

A support and friendship from the successor to the throne.

There was no present more reassuring than this.

But surprisingly, this wasn’t the end of the present.

Manus was a person with a much bigger heart than Roan had thought.

*****

The Pershion Kingdom’s capital, Althus Castle, was suddenly flipped over.

This was because the news that the First Prince Reitas tried to assassinate the Second Prince Manus and failed had reached them.

While transferring Reitas and Baites as well as the knights who survived, Manus arrested all who were related to the assassinate case.

In this process, the chatterbox flatterer Baite’s role was greatly influential.

To survive, he fully revealed each and every sympathizer and accomplice.

It truly was a sudden event.

As the situation flew critically, the neutral faction’s nobles, who had been eyeing Reitas’ mood, all stepped up and supported Manus.

Like that, Manus came to dominate the entire political stage in an instant.

“Older brother Reitas has been decided to be exiled to Telroy Island.”

Manus bitterly smiled as he shook his head.

Roan slowly nodded.

Telroy Island, located in the north of Pershion Kingdom, was an extremely isolated and small island in the Notunne Sea.

It was greatly far away from the capital, Althus, and was an incredibly hard place to approach.

‘I’m relieved at least.’

Roan inwardly let out a sigh.

He had needlessly worried that Manus may perhaps leave him near the capital and keep watch.

“Thank you very much for saving my life. I will never forget this gratitude.”

Manus lowered his head.

They probably weren’t light words.

He took out an object about the size of a palm wrapped in silk.

“What is this, sir?”

Roan carefully asked, but Manus merely smiled.

Roan carefully untied and opened the silk.

Soon, a metallic medallion engraved with numerous patterns and picture appeared.

“When a prince is born, our Pershion Kingdom create and give him a metallic medallion called Ates. You could call it a type of identification medal. That’s older brother Reitas’ ates.”

“Why would you give me such a precious thing……?”

Roan asked while motionlessly stared at Ates.

Manus faintly smiled as he answered.

“If you request anything with ates, I will give you anything.”

“Ah……”

Roan let out quiet exclamation.

A palm-sized metal medallion, ates.

This was the great gift that Manus was giving to Roan.

“Why would you grant me such a big gift without knowing what I’ll ask?”

Roan asked as he faintly smiled.

With a firm and composed way of speech, Manus answered.

“It’s okay whatever the request is. Since I would already be dead if it wasn’t for Baron Tale.”

A generous decision.

Roan quietly stared at Manus, then gently wrapped the ates with the silk and placed it within his chest pocket.

“Thank you very much.”

When he deeply lowered his head and gave his thanks, Manus shook his hands.

“No. It isn’t sufficient with just this much. Also……”

He blurred the end of his words a bit, then stood up from his seat.

“I still have to thank Harrison, Brian, and Clay for their help. So……”

Manus brightly smiled as he looked at Roan.

“I’ve been contemplating how to repay them, then a good method came up at a good time.”

“That is……?”

Roan followed and stood up a moment late, and asked.

Manus answered as he walked towards the door.

“In the war with the Byron and Istel allied army, our Pershion Kingdom achieved a complete victory. We acquired an incredible number of captives and loot.”

Roan wordlessly nodded as he followed his back.

Kiiig.

The reception room’s door opened.

Harrison, Brian, and Clay, who had been walking about the hallway, quickly lowered their heads.

Manus added on as he looked at that sight.

“Although we returned all the prisoners, we didn’t return the loot. We built a large vault in Althus Castle and stored them all in there.”

He turned his gaze and looked at Roan.

“I will open the vault to Baron Tale, Harrison, Brian, and Clay. Please choose and take what you like.”

“Ah……”

Roan once again leaked out a quiet exclamation.

Just the ates alone was a great and precious gift.

He hadn’t expected at all for him to possibly open the loot vault, and not only to him but also Harrison, Brian, and Clay at that.

Roan slightly lowered his head.

“Truly, thank you very much.”

At those words, Manus made a slightly mischievous look.

“Please don’t be like that. Is the price of my life perhaps not even worth that much?”

“That is……”

Roan made a slightly flustered-looking face.

But he soon brightly smiled and shook his head.

“Of course it isn’t.”

“Then, please receive my presents with happy feelings.”

Manus lowered his head, then turned to Harrison, Brian, and Clay.

The three people, who didn’t knew what was going on, merely blinked their eyes.

Manus loudly clapped.

Clap!

“Then, should we go?”

At those words, Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay rapidly moved their feet and exited the hallway.

When they rode a carriage outside the mansion and headed towards the outskirt of the Althus Castle, an enormous building soon appeared.

“Oh!”

“It’s a first time I’m seeing that big of a building……”

“It truly is amazing.”

Harrison, Brian, and Clay looked out the carriage’s window and exclaimed.

Manus cheerfully smiled and spoke with an energetic voice.

“That is the very loot vault.”

*****

“Isn’t this just way too much?”

Harrison’s expression looked dumbfound.

Seeing the monumental amount of loot piled inside the vault, he clicked his tongue.

Although Manus said to take time to look around and choose anything that they liked, the amount was such that it looked like it would take days just to look around.

Seeing that sight, Manus faintly smiled as he opened his mouth.

“It’s because we’ve gather even miscellaneous things. During categorization process, we’ve separated and gathered the things we think are valuable deeper inside.”

“Ah, is that so, your highness?”

Harrison shyly smiled and scratched his head.

Manus walked ahead of them and headed deep into the vault.

Harrison, Brian, and Clay followed behind.

On the other hand, Roan stood at the center of the space piled full of sundry objects and slowly turned his body in a circle.

‘Most of them are things without much value.’

Right now, he was using the Kalian’s Tears and taking in countless visual information.

Without particularly walking up and checking, he was accurately analyzing the identities of the objects that were randomly organized.

‘As expected, there isn’t anything that particularly stands ou…… hm?’

As he was taking his gaze away and about to walk away, Roan abruptly stopped and looked towards a corner.

‘That is……’

As if possessed by something, he moved his steps.

At a space heaped and piled with big and small, and old and clean books.

Roan picked up a book that stood out amongst them.

Vasis Mana Technique.

The very thin book was a book of mana technique compilation.

‘The basic mana technique that represents the Byron Kingdom.’

The Vasis Mana Technique was in fact the most basic mana technique that one learned when attending academy knight school in the Byron Kingdom.

Although in the case of most warrior-nobles, their houses each had unique mana technique and had no reason to learn such a basic mana technique, but in the case of scholar-nobles and sons of powerful families that aren’t nobles, they needed the foundational mana technique that would strengthen their basics.

Consequently, there was the Batelein Mana Technique in the Rinse Kingdom and Datio Mana Technique in the Istel Kingdom.

But it was a mana technique in words only, and grasping the mana hole and moving the mana through the mana road was the all of this basic mana technique.

The most important part, accumulation of mana, wasn’t possible.

Of course, since it was still a mana technique, it was certainly an object that would be hard to come across unless one was a student of an academy or a noble.

‘There’s also Datio Mana Technique.’

Roan also picked up the Istel Kingdom’s basic mana technique compilation that was next to the Vasis Mana Technique.

‘With this, I could let the fief’s soldiers feel just what mana is.’

Currently, one of the Tale Barony’s biggest problem was the lack of a knight order.

No, the knight order wasn’t a problem but that there wasn’t any knight at all.

‘To be specific, there’s only Brian.’

But with just that much, he couldn’t exercise an overwhelming force in times of emergency.

The Vasis Mana Technique and the Datio Mana Technique could act as a breakthrough that could solve this problem.

Of course, there were also problems.

‘Would it be alright to train the soldiers in foreign kingdom’s mana technique?’

But even so, they couldn’t use Rinse Kingdom’s Batelein Mana Technique.

‘Since only the academy’s students and the nobles are allowed to learn the kingdom’s basic mana technique.’

The moment Roan begin to privately teach mana technique to the soldiers, the nobles nearby would all rose up like a swarm of bees.

‘Should I take it for now?’

Although there was no guarantee that he could teach them even if he brought it back, and it was the most basic mana technique that couldn’t even accumulate mana, he judged that, even so, it would be much better than not having it.

‘But is it fine to choose two things?’

Roan awkwardly smiled and moved his feet.

When he walked into the deeper area of the vault, he could see Harrison, Brian, and Clay.

They also seemed to have found things they liked.

Harrison was tightly clenching a bow that, with just a glance, seemed to be strong and have incredible tension.

“It’s a bow I’ve never seen before, sir. I’m planning on comparing it to the ones I have.”

Roan nodded his head without a word.

Harrison didn’t simply shoot the bow very well.

Analysing and comparing various bows, he was repeating a research after research to build a slightly stronger bow.

‘Another kingdom’s bow…… certainly, it should help in the research.’

Roan turned his gaze and looked at Brian.

He was wearing an incredible heavy armor that looked strenuous just from a glance.

“It’s somehow a bit different than the one I usually wear, my lord. If we take time and analyze it, I think it could become a big help to our fief’s troops.”

At those words, Roan also wordlessly nodded his head.

There was something that Brian always said with a regrettable look.

That the Tale Legion centered around the Amaranth Troop was definitely strong but is only excessively light and fast.

He had greatly desired an establishment of heavy infantry troops that wore heavy armor.

‘The current heavy armors are impossible for regular infantry to wear. If it’s Brian, he should be able to solve that problem well.’

Roan once again turned his gaze and looked at Clay.

Unlike the others, he was holding a large chunk of jewel.

“It seems there wasn’t anything I needed, my lord. I will sell this and have it supplement the fief’s finance.”

It was an extremely Clay-like choice and decision.

Roan quietly nodded his head.

At that moment.

“It seems Baron Tale has also chose something.”

Manus brightly smiled as he approached.

Roan shyly smiled and answered.

“Shamefully, I ended up picking two things.”

“Hmm. Vasis Mana Technique and Datio Mana Technique…… would you be fine with such things?”

Manus instead asked with a worried look.

Even just in the vault, there were multiple books of Vasis Mana Technique and Datio Mana Technique piled up.

They were objects that had little value to that extent.

But there was nothing more valuable than them to Roan.

“I’m fine with just this much.”

“Hmm. Okay. If Baron Tale says so, then it couldn’t be helped. But instead, I’ll give both of them to you.”

“Thank you very much.”

Roan lowered his head.

Manus shook his head.

“I’m glad that it looks like everyone got what they wanted.”

That was his honest feeling.

He was truly glad that he was able to repay them at least like this.

Roan and Manus, Harrison and Brian, and Clay looked at each other for a while and smiled.

Like that, their relationship become slightly tighter and closer.

******

Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay, who returned to their residence, sat down at the reception room and chatted.

“My lord. By the way, just why did you choose books of foreign kingdoms’ basic mana technique of all things?”

Brian, who had been drinking a cup of tea, asked with a confused look.

Roan looked at the two volumes of basic mana technique compilation piled up at one side of the table, and faintly smiled.

“I was wondering if I could teach the soldiers of the fief troop.”

“The foreign kingdoms’ mana techniques?”

Brian asked with a slightly shocked expression.

Then, Clay spoke in a calm voice.

“Since only the academy’s students and nobles can learn the Rinse Kingdom’s basic mana technique, it couldn’t be helped.”

He turned his head and looked at Roan.

“But the basic mana technique is only a half-done mana technique that can’t even accumulate mana. And because they’re foreign kingdoms’ mana technique, we cannot study it as we wish.”

“Yes. I know. But I took it just in case. Since a breakthrough may happen if we study the two mana techniques.”

At those words, Harrison and Clay quietly nodded their heads.

At that moment, Brian put down his teacup and cautiously asked.

“Would it be alright if I took a look, sir?”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

Once the permission was given, Brian slowly read the basic mana techniques of the two books.

A moment later, he murmured with a flat expression as if it was nothing.

“This might be usable if we alter it a bit.”

Brian raised his head and looked at Roan.

“Although the two mana techniques look different at a glance, the core of their studies are notably similar because they are really the most basic of basics. If we mix our kingdom’s Batelein Mana Technique here and add the mana accumulation method of a mana technique I know……”

His voice slowly went down and soon became a soliloquy.

Murmuring to himself, he fell deep into analyzing the books.

Because it was Brian, who had chaotically learned all sorts of mana techniques from the young age, he could clearly see the core of the mana techniques.

But most of all.

‘Come to think of it, I had temporarily forgotten.’

Looking at Brian, who was ferociously concentrating, Roan made a hollow smile.

‘Brian Miles. Just how much of an incredible genius you are……’

Chapter 146




T/n (CSV): The regular chapter for Thursday, June 22nd.

Roan hurried the preparation to return to the kingdom.

Before the news of Reitas and Manus’ veiled strife reached the Istel Kingdom, they had to cross the border.

‘Once the news of the strife spreads, my name will definitely come up.’

It wasn’t quite a desirable situation from Roan’s position.

If it was the Istel Kingdom that feared and despised him while calling him the Crimson Ghost, it was obvious that they would light up their eyes and guard the borders.

‘Furthermore, we conveniently have a method to safely cross the border.’

It was literally a perfect opportunity.

Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay had decided to mix in with the Pershion Kingdom’s negotiators, who were sent to the Istel Kingdom in order to mediate and negotiate the war remuneration problem and the overall cleanup issue.

The Istel Kingdom, which was the defeated nation, wasn’t in a position to check nor guard against the negotiators from the Pershion Kingdom, the victorious nation, as they wished.

Even if the Pershion Kingdom’s negotiators played haughty and showed arrogant attitudes, their position was such that they could only clench their teeth and be patient.

This was because it may just influence the negotiation process.

Thanks to that, Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay could arrive at the Istel Kingdom’s capital, Ceres Castle, without any notable problem.

“Then. Please give a good word to Prince Manus.”

The head of the Pershion Kingdom’s negotiator group, Viscount Nills Fraiden, held Roan and repeatedly entreated.

This was because he knew that Manus and Roan had a very close relationship.

Nills wanted to catch Manus’ eyes through Roan.

“I’ve put a bit of effort so that your journey won’t be uncomfortable.”

Pointlessly glancing around, he handed a bulky bag of money.

Roan looked at that sight for a while, then soon shook his head.

“I’ll put in a good word, sir.”

Meaning that he didn’t need the bag of money.

He then turned around and went out of the building.

“Eh?!”

Nills awkwardly smiled and merely blinked his eyes without knowing what to do.

‘Should I chase? Or should I step back at this point?’

He simply couldn’t feel any inkling.

When he was hesitating with an anxious heart.

“You can give it me, sir.”

Clay extended his two hands with a friendly smile.

Nills hesitated for a moment, then passed the bag of money.

“Clay. I’ll be trusting you.”

“Yes. Please don’t worry.”

Clay shamelessly replied, then took the bag of money.

There were so much things that they had to spend money on from now on, so there was no need to refuse an easy money like that.

In return, they just needed to not do anything that was unjust or despicable.

Receive because they give.

But there is no return.

That was Clay’s thought.

Harrison and Brian, who were watching, inwardly shook their heads in amazement.

But even so, they didn’t feel like criticize nor condemn him.

‘Certainly, the parts we’ve lacked has been filled ever since Clay was appointed.’

‘He shouldered the work that others were reluctant to do.’

The petty, detestable, underhanded and materialistic works were all taken care of by Clay.

Because he was there, almost all of the Amarant troops and Tale Legionnaires were able to maintain aloof characters.

‘He’s certainly a genius.’

‘In various ways, he is a necessary genius.’

Already, Harrison and Brian also approved of Clay.

“Then we will now be going……”

Clay, Harrison, and Brian said their farewell and exited the building.

Nills, who was left alone, unconsciously clenched his fists.

‘Alright! It went well!’

He trusted Clay without a single doubt.

It felt as if a bright and promising future was spreading before his eyes.

*****

While Roan, Harrison, Brian, and Clay left for the Pershion Kingdom, the Charity Trust had actively purchased the Istel Kingdom’s farmlands.

No, to be exact, they had secured a temporary ownership through a long-term lease.

Although a single company was renting out an unusually and amazingly large amount of land, the Istel Kingdom did not take any action.

Instead, they introduced farmlands nearby the leased land and tried to promote more leasing contracts.

The Istel Kingdom’s situation was just that difficult.

The crop yield that repeated to nosedive year after year, and the astronomical war remuneration payment from the two defeated wars.

The economy had already dropped through the floor.

“That is all.”

“Good work.”

Roan nodded his head as he received the report from Hodram, the Charity Trust’s true caravan head.

The purchasing of the farmlands was much more successful than he had thought.

‘Starting next year, the crop yield will rapidly increase.’

If a future similar to the last life unfolded, Roan would become incredibly rich.

‘Huu.’

Roan breathed in deeply.

He felt happy and contented.

Of course, Clay still didn’t understood the reason why they purchased the farmlands.

“Then……”

Roan looked at the people around him as he stood up from his seat.

A smile hung from his mouth.

“Should we go back home?”

Instantly, everyone’s expressions became bright.

They swiftly lowered their heads.

“Yes. My lord. We will hurry the preparation to return to the kingdom.”

The preparation to cross the border once more began.

Beyond the border, the hometown that they missed so much awaited.

*****

“We were rejected again, right?”

“It’s not rejected, but they requested us to wait a bit more because there were lot of places they had to focus on.”

An adolescent young man and a white-haired old man sat facing each other and conversed.

At the old man’s words, the young man creased his brows.

“That’s a rejection.”

“I told you it’s not!”

The old man shouted with a flustered expression.

The young man exhaled a long sigh.

“It’s been ten years since the kingdom’s support to us, Reno school Magic Tower, has stopped, and five years since the backing from the royalties, nobles, and many influential houses has stopped. Even though we’ve sold the magic tower, sold the land, and even liquidated the treasures during that time to barely stay alive, we’re now definitely at our limit. Forget magic research, we’re at a state where we have to worry about how to eat right now.”

The lamentation of their lives dripped with desperation.

‘Also, the number of mages associated with us dropped below twenty people.’

The young man couldn’t bear to say this story at least and suppressed it tightly within himself.

In his own way, he was being considerate of the old man in front of his eyes, the head of the Reno school and the ex-owner of the magic tower Lemming Ade, so that he won’t become too despondent.

But despite the young man’s such consideration, the old man, Lemming, was completely dispirited.

“Is there any way?”

It was a question honestly thrown absently without much expectation.

As if he was waiting, the young man spoke in a tender voice.

“Instead of useless magic research, why don’t we Reno school also study and train magics like attack, defense, and healing that are related to war?”

“That absolutely isn’t allowed!”

Lemming furiously shouted aloud.

The one stand of self-respect that was left, no the pride of the school that couldn’t be given up regardless of whatever happened exploded out.

“Unlike other schools, us Reno school have the goal in using magic to raise the quality and the standard of living. We aren’t some obsessed school that simply focuses on one subject like attack magic, defense magic, and healing magic.”

“Yes, yes. Understood.”

The young man nodded his head with a pout then pointed at a lamp in the lab.

“And the thing we made after two years of research is a lamp like this.”

He picked up a metal disk, about a size of two fingers thick, from on top of the table.

On the front of the disk, a very complex magic array was engraved hazily.

When the young man touched the magic array and inserted mana with the tip of his finger, the magic array flashed for a moment on the lamp’s surface and then disappeared.

At the same time.

Paat!

Inside the lamp, a very small ball of light appeared.

From the center of the lamp, a bright light spread out.

Looking at that sight, Lemming made a proud smile.

“Brilliant, Just brilliant. Now thanks to this magic lamp, the people of the world will no longer fear the dark.”

“The people of the world?”

With a dumbfound look, the young man shook his head.

He pressed the metal disk once more to turn off the lamp, then let out a sigh.

“Tower Master. What do we need to make that magic lamp?”

It was a question that nailed the pith.

Lemming hesitated for a moment, then spoke in a crawling voice.

“Magic stone.”

The young man nodded his head.

“That’s right. Although the size may be small, it needs magic stone. And one for the lamp, and one for this metal disk that Master calls the controller at that. In all, it needs two.”

“The lamp can be used without the controller.”

Lemming shouted as if to say it’s unfair.

The young man once again nodded his head.

“Yes. We can turn on and off the light with just the lamp. But even so, it needs one magic stone. Not anything else, but a magic stone. A magic stone. We have to use a magic stone, that’s much more expensive than gold, for a petty lamp like this.”

“Pe, petty……”

Lemming’s voice trembled.

Without minding it, the young man continued to spoke.

“Master. With the money to buy a single magic stone, you can buy years’ worth of lamp oil. It’s a business that doesn’t hold figure with regular commoners.”

Those words were correct.

Although they had invented the magic lamp at the end of two years of research, the supplying was actually was impossible.

Lemming sighed while deeply dropped his head, then raised up the last strand of pride.

“That’s why we’re researching a material that could replace magic stone.”

“You mean the magic liquid?”

“Yes. Magic liquid.”

Lemming immediately nodded his head.

The young man exhaled a sigh.

“How many years has it been since us Reno school began to research magic liquid?”

“Wouldn’t it be at least two hundred years?”

“And the research progress so far?”

“That’s……”

Lemming couldn’t finish his words.

The research had been walking in circle for decades.

‘Did I say too much?’

As he looked at Lemming, who was completely dejected, his heart ached a moment late.

Faking a cough, he made an awkward smile.

“Anyway, if we won’t research magic related to war like other schools, in the end, we can only look for a new patron.”

“But wherever I ask, they all reject, no they all ask me to wait a bit longer.”

Lemming’s expression was still dispirited.

The young man cheerfully smiled.

“That’s because we’re only searching for a patron near the capital.”

“That can’t be helped. Research needs a lot of money, and most of the people with that much wealth lives in the capital, Miller.”

At Lemming’s words, the young man shook his head.

“That’s not true. There are quite a lot of adequate people in the provinces. Especially if it’s that person who is receiving the most heated attention these days, he may sponsor us.”

“That person?”

Lemming frowned as he cautiously asked.

The smile on the young man’s mouth became thicker.

“I’m talking about sir Baron Roan Tale.”

“Ah……”

Lemming let out a quiet exclamation.

Even he, who only focused on magic research, had heard of rumors about Roan.

“Would sir Baron Tale sponsor us?”

“Who knows. We’ll have to face him first. If we get rejected again, we can search for someone else again.”

The young man shrugged and lightly answered.

Seeing that sight, Lemming made a bitter smile.

“I’m sorry. Because of a foolish master, you have so much hardship.”

“What hardship? If it wasn’t for master, I would still be begging on the streets.”

Lemming nodded at the young man’s words.

“No, it wouldn’t be like that. Although you aren’t any polite with words, your talent is great.”

“Ehee. Don’t say such embarrassing words, master.”

The young man exaggeratedly shook his body.

But Lemming was quite serious.

“I’m serious. McCrum. If it’s your talent, you will definitely make our school prosper.”

The light in his eyes were hot.

The young man, McCrum, quietly stared at that light and then snickered and shook his hand.

“Sigh. I got it. I got it. Since there’s also the good will that I received from master, I’ll work hard and make us Reno school the best school.”

“Yes, I trust you.”

Lemming nodded his head.

Seemingly unable to take the heavy mood, McCrum needlessly fussed.

“Okay! Then, should we start with cleaning our things?”

“Yes. Let’s clean it all up and leave this capital that I had enough of.”

McCrum brightly smiled at Lemming’s words and nodded his head.

“Yes. Let’s leave. Towards the place where our hopes for our dream and future is, to Tale Barony……”

*****

Once again acting as the fake caravan head, Clay led the caravan and headed towards the Rinse Kingdom.

The travel was much more safer and comfortable than they had thought.

This was because, from the Istel Kingdom’s position, the Charity Trust was a generous and rich client as well as a customer the kingdom was thankful to.

Thanks to that, they were able to arrive at the border gate a bit faster than they had scheduled.

“Oho. You were even more amazing person than I had thought.”

The border gate captain Dose raised his thumb towards Clay.

He had already received report about Clay and the Charity Trust from the central administration.

“You’ve rented those lands that nobody even glanced at in wholesale?”

“Yes. We wanted to be of help to the Istel Kingdom in any way possible.”

“Hahaha! As expected, my eyes for people are exact. You’re really a good natured fellow unlike the young ones these days. Hahaha!”

Does loudly laughed out and tapped Clay’s shoulder.

Smiling along, Clay passed a bag full of gold and silver.

“I picked it up on the way. Please do find the owner this time as well.”

“Hahaha. Don’t worry. I’ll definitely make sure to find the owner.”

Dose laughed out even louder and nodded his head.

That that moment.

‘Un?’

Clay slightly creased his brows.

At the place his line of sight touched.

A soldier was approaching towards Roan, who was located in the middle of the caravan band.

‘What is it?’

Even Clay, who was always bold and full of confidence, had a slightly flabbergasted look.

That was also the same for Roan.

‘What could it be?’

Staring at the soldier with large eyes, he tilted his head.

“Hello. I’m a border guard Pichio.”

The soldier with large eyes, he was Pichio.

He was the very soldier who pointed at Roan and said he was strange when the Charity Trust passed through the border gate the first time.

“Yes. So is there any issue……?”

Roan asked in a careful voice while nodding his head.

He intentionally shrunk his shoulders and made a fearful expression.

Pichio blinked his big eyes.

“What may be your name?”

“It’s Henry.”

Roan said the fake name that he prepared beforehand.

“Your age?”

“I’m twenty two years old.”

“Are you from the Rinse Kingdom?”

“Yes. I’m from the western region.”

Short questions and answers went back and forth.

Even during that while, Pichio carefully looked over Roan as well as the people around him.

“How long has it been since you started doing company works?”

“It’s been three years including this year. For what reason do you ask, sir?”

Roan spoke in a fearful voice.

“That’s……”

When Pichio was just about to speak.

“What is it over there?”

Dose creased his brows and walked up.

It was because Clay had passed another small bag of money and complained that the border check was excessively meticulous.

For a new source of cash, Dose pulled back his sleeves and stepped forwards.

“Ah, captain.”

Pichio immediately saluted.

Dose approached extremely close and spoke with a completely annoyed expression.

“What are you doing?”

“That’s……”

Pichio slightly glanced at Roan, and then whispered in a quiet voice.

“However I look, this porter is suspicious.”

Roan leaned his ears since it felt like it was about him, but he couldn’t hear well because the voice was too quiet.

Dose creased his forehead.

“What?”

“His pose and strides are different than a regular porter. And the setup of the people nearby and even the goods are all centered around this……”

When his words reached that point.

“This bastard!”

Dose suddenly kicked at him.

Puuk!

“Kuk!”

Feeling a suffocating pain, Pichio fell down onto the ground.

“Ca, captain.”

The eyes that were already big became as large as lamps.

Not minding them, Dose continued to kick at Pichio, who fell down on the ground.

Puk! Puuk! Puk!

Heavy sounds loudly echoed.

“Did this bastard lose his mind! What’s what? The pose and the strides are different than regular porters? This insane bastard! Say something that makes sense!”

Angry shouts exploded out.

“Ugh! Kuugh!”

Painful groans sounded.

Pichio curled his body up into a circle.

Puk! Puuk! Puk!

Dose’s kicking continued for a long while.

“Eeeh, insane bastard! Twet!”

When his breath caught up, he stopped his kicking and spat a thick spit.

And waving his hand towards Roan as if to say sorry, he went up to Clay again.

He was going to check whether the feeling of his new source of money was hurt.

“Uhuk. Hhhuuk. Uhuk.”

Pichio cried out while fallen on the ground.

What he had done wasn’t something he should have been hit like this.

He had simply done what he had to do as a border gate guard.

“You okay?”

“Here, lean on my shoulder and slowly stand up.”

The soldiers nearby came up and helped Pichio stand.

Pichio rubbed off the sorrowful tears with the back of his hand.

During that time, his eyes met Roan, who was quietly standing still.

Roan slightly lowered his head.

He felt sorry somehow.

‘Needlessly because of me…… anyway……’

On the other hand.

‘He realized the strangeness just from seeing my strides and pose?’

If it was true, that was truly an incredible talent.

Roan quietly stared at Pichio, who was walking off while being supported by the other soldiers.

‘I want to learn a bit more about him, but……’

He felt a bit regrettable.

As the situation was so, he couldn’t carelessly talk to him.

But thankfully, he had Clay.

‘It seems he liked him. Well, if he really found a strange point just from seeing that much of the situation, it isn’t a talent to look over so easily……’

Clay searched Roan’s expression, then looked at Dose, who was brown-nosing.

“Captain. Who was that soldier just now?”

“Ah, he’s called Pichio, and he’s a bastard who usually has a bad case of suspicion. He often say something is strange, that is strange, it sounds like a lie and quarrel with people. Since I took care of him, there won’t be anything like this anymore. So there is no need to be concerned anymore.”

“Is that so? Then he is a bit of a problematic soldier. But the reason you continue to keep him under you is……?”

“Ah, that’s because he is from this region, and usually practices writing, so he can read and write, and……”

For a while, Dose spoke on and on about Pichio.

Enthusiastically agreeing from time to time, Clay learned even more information.

Dose took hold of himself only after chatting for a long time.

“Un? So why was I talking about that bastard? Anyhow, because there will never be something like this again, don’t worry.”

“Yes. I trust the captain.”

“Yeah. Just trust me. Just me.”

Clay and Dose shared a bit more friendly chat, then promised of a next meeting.

Soon, with the wagon Clay was on at the head, the caravan band began to move.

They had safely crossed the Istel Kingdom’s border gate.

Clop. Clop.

Roan went to Clay only after they had reached the end of the buffer zone.

“Did you find out anything about that soldier?”

“Yes. His name is Pichio, age is twenty six, he is a local of that region, and it has been three years since he began to work as the gate guard.”

Clay briefly answered, then stared straight into Roan’s eyes.

“My lord.”

His voice was rather serious.

After organizing the thoughts within his head, he spoke with an expression full of certainty.

“Pichio. We will have to bring that soldier with us.”

Chapter 147




T/n (CSV): The regular chapter for Sunday.

An inborn talent.

Although Pichio himself hadn’t been able to realize it, he had a brilliant talent that was unlike others.

Of course, that was wholly Clay’s judgment.

‘The sharp eyes. And……’

It was different than how Roan used the Kalian’s Tears to grasp many visual information at once.

Even while looking at the same thing, Pichio could find a difference within it.

The reason was.

‘Instinct.’

Clay judged that Pichio’s sixth sense, which sensed things that were strange, dangerous, and unusual, was greatly developed.

‘Whether his instinct is developed or not, there is enough value in bringing him with us.’

Just with having good and sharp eyes, there was enough value in having him at their side.

‘Just the number of dependents the continent’s top most powerful houses have numbers in the thousands.’

People were wealth.

Even for a petty talent and ability, there were places and times it was needed.

“Pichio has been beaten by Dose to a pulp. Also, it seems his relationship with the other guards is originally not quite good. I will order some people and make up a situation, sir.”

Clay faintly smiled as he organized the schemes to employ Pichio that arose within his head.

Of course, it would be difficult to extract Pichio within a month or two even so.

There was a need for a plan that looked long term and perfectly tie him up.

Roan nodded his head and entrusted the related mission to Clay.

At that moment.

“We can see the border gate!”

A man standing at the head of the caravan band shouted aloud.

From here and there, loud sounds of laughter resounded.

Finishing the greatly tense life in the foreign kingdoms, they had finally returned home.

*****

Roan sent Harrison, Brian, Clay, and the caravan band to the Tale Barony and headed alone towards the capital, Miller.

Standing in front of King Deni Von Rinse, the three princes, and the nobles, he revealed the fact that he formed friendship with the Pershion Kingdom as he presented the relevant letter.

Deni III spoke words of criticism at how he made friendship with a foreign kingdom based on a prince’s order without the king’s permission.

But on the other hand, he himself had no interest in politics and delighted at the fact that the door of trade that had been closed for decades had opened.

The one definite thing was that Simon once again took one more step ahead in the competition for the succession of the throne.

That was what the Rinse Kingdom’s nobles thought.

“You are going back right away?”

“Yes, your highness. I have left the fief for much too long.”

When Simon spoke with a lonely expression, Roan slightly lowered his head.

Although he had entrusted the fief to the capable and loyal subordinates, the time he spent in the Tale Barony after the Poskein Exodus was almost none.

He wished to return even a moment faster.

“Well, you have really been going around busily.”

Simon smacked his lips and nodded his head.

It was because he too knew that it wasn’t a situation where he could keep Roan close for very long.

He signaled with his eyes towards Viscount Tio Ruin, who was standing nearby.

Tio then took two wooden boxes from the back of the office and appeared.

He placed the boxed on top of the table.

“This is my present to you. Open it.”

Simon cheerfully smiled as he looked at Roan.

Roan slightly lowered his head, then opened the lid of the wider of the two boxes.

“Hhm?”

His expression turned slightly surprised.

Inside the boxes were objects he had completely not expected.

He heard Simon’s voice.

“They’re Dion roots dug from the Grain Mountains.”

“These precious things……”

Roan couldn’t even dare touch the contents inside the box.

Purplish Roots.

‘If it’s Dion root, it should be the most sacred herbs said to be touched by a dragon’s breath.’

If one ate Dion roots, the mana increased rapidly.

‘Per each root, one could earn an amount of mana that requires an year of tireless training to gather.’

Although it wasn’t an incredible amount, even just that much was an amazing amount.

Furthermore, within the box were in fact five Dion roots evenly laid out.

Seeing the sight of Roan delighting at it, Simon smiled gleefully and pointed at the small box next to it.

“Go ahead and open that one as well.”

“Yes? Ah, yes.”

Still with a slightly dazed look, Roan opened the small box’s lid.

“This is……”

Roan once again made a surprised look.

Inside the box was a single book with a clean cover.

“It’s a book of spearmanship found at the palace reference room.”

Unlike the library that was open to many people, the palace reference room was a secret vault-like place that not anyone could enter.

Currently, there were only four people permitted the entry into the reference room.

They were only the current king Deni III and the three princes, Simon, Tommy, and Kallum.

“I had wanted to find you a really incredible book of spearmanship, but compared to swordsmanship or spells, there didn’t seem to be anything worthy about spearmanship. The thing I found in the end is that. Flepsse Spearmanship.”

“Flepsse Spearmanship……”

Roan quietly whispered as he looked at the book of spearmanship.

Seeing how the cover was clean, it was certain that Simon had transcribed it himself.

‘If it’s Flepsse Spearmanship, it’s the spearmanship of Count Natus Flepsse who was active a hundred years ago. Although it certainly is amazing, it’s difficult to see it as an incredible spearmanship even so.’

Of course, it wasn’t certain since he hadn’t personally seen and experienced it.

But the one thing for sure was that its level wasn’t something comparable to Pierce.

‘But even so, it’ll be an incredible help to me.’

Roan had never learned a standardized and refined spearmanship.

He had only gathered countlessly many spearmanship techniques from actual battles and been training his own unique spearmanship.

‘If I study Flepsse Spearmanship, I may be able to combine the many spearmanship from actual battles more easily.’

It literally was no different than getting a textbook.

Roan carefully closed the lids of the boxes containing the book and the Dion roots, and then turned towards Simon.

“Truly, thank you very much.”

“I should be the one saying thank you.”

Simon brightly smiled and nodded his head.

Those were his honest words.

‘I became closer to the throne thanks to Baron Tale.’

Because he was there, he was able to pass and step ahead of his younger brothers in the throne succession competition.

Simon quietly looked at Roan, then made a bright smile.

“Baron Roan Tale.”

“Yes. Prince.”

Roan slightly lowered his head.

Simon inhaled deeply as he continued to speak.

“I will continue to rely on you from now on as well.”

Strength was carried onto his voice.

He was already planning for the events after the throne succession competition.

Roan was an existence that was definitely necessary in that process.

“Yes. I will do my best.”

Roan deeply lowered his head and spoke in a powerful voice.

Like that, the two shared a pleasant chat for a while.

“Then, I will now leave, sir.”

Roan was only able to exit Simon’s mansion by the time the surroundings became dark.

It was quite a late hour.

However, he moved his feet towards someplace that wasn’t his residence.

After an unknown amount of time.

Roan appeared again.

‘For now, he wouldn’t be able to move easily as he wish. No, at least……’

With quick steps, he crossed the street towards his residence.

‘I will be holding the knife handle.’

The place Roan briefly stopped by.

That was in fact Kallum Rinse’s mansion.

Swooosh.

Just in time, a cold north wind blew. 1

*****

Roan didn’t particularly wish to enter the fief loudly.

Intentionally picking an early hour, he crossed the Mediasis village and entered the entrance of the fief lord’s castle.

No, it was a lord’s castle in name only, and was still a simple building made up of offices and meeting rooms.

It was when Roan had just entered the central hall.

“Thank you very much for your work.”

He heard a familiar voice.

“We’re glad that you have come back safely, my lord.”

Following behind, resounding voices were heard.

In the central hall, many retainers including Austin were lined up straight.

“Did you know I was coming back?”

When Roan shyly smiled, Austin made a bright smile.

“The agents of Agens are active throughout the Tale Barony. We knew ever since lord entered the fief’s border.”

Roan slowly nodded his head at those words.

Since he didn’t move while intentionally hide his identity, it shouldn’t be very difficult for the Agens agents to find him.

But.

‘The communication system is well organized.’

Although he had moved rather quickly, the news had already reached the lord’s castle before he arrived.

‘Brilliant. As expected of Chris.’

If it was to this extent, there wouldn’t be much problem from now on even when hunting and spying on other noble’s, and possibly a foreign nation’s spies.

“You’ve done well until now.”

His voice carried strength.

At Roan’s words, all the retainers turned their ears and listened.

“But there is still much more to do. Us Tale Barony……”

Roan faintly smiled.

“Starts now.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Everyone including Austin answered in one voice.

Their faces and voices were resolute.

Their hearts raced rapidly.

Ambition.

They were ready to follow Roan and spread a large dream.

Roan faintly smiled as he looked at that sight.

‘I too must work harder than now.’

He resolved his heart on his own.

He moved a little more faster, a little bit more further than his retainers.

There was no instance of lazing about just because he was a noble and a fief’s lord.

Also, Roan knew of parts he lacked very well.

Because of it, he called the scholars and the military officers together and opened various meetings before proceeding the works.

“What happened to the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild Arnold recommended?”

Roan looked at Keep, who sat at the end of the meeting room.

“We have disguised and infiltrated the Tenebra Troop members.”

“The situation?”

“They received the guild master’s trust and are acting as official mercenaries.”

A short conversation went back and forth between Roan and Keep.

Thanks to successfully infiltrating while disguised, they were able to meticulously grasp the information concerning the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild.

“Good. Build the mercenary guild headquarter in the outskirt of the Mediasis village. I permit their relocation. But……”

Roan stared straight into Keep’s eyes.

“Keep the Tenebra Troop members who infiltrated inside the guild as a secret until the end.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Keep lowered his head and answered.

Following that, Roan turned to Clay.

Clay glanced once at the prepared materials and then spoke in a composed voice.

“While we were away in the Pershion Kingdom, the number of engineers including alchemists, blacksmiths, carpenters, and so on increased. Even now, although by a small number, they are continuously increasing.”

At those words, Roan formed a faint smile.

The alchemists and engineers were organizations that couldn’t possibly be excluded from the fief’s development plan that Roan had thought up.

“Because the size of the alchemist guild and the engineers union have become bigger, there is a need to manage them a bit more systemically.”

“Okay. We will proceed that part after consulting with the managers.”

“And……”

Clay’s words hadn’t ended.

Unlike just before, he spoke in a cautious voice.

“Several druids have requested appointment.”

“Druids?”

Roan asked back with a slightly surprised expression.

Clay faintly smiled as he answered.

“I have sent letters to druids who are connected to me. Because they are those whose talents are too valuable to waste.”

“Hmm.”

With a quiet groan, Roan nodded his head.

“If they work together with us, they will be a great strength.”

“Then we will……?”

“Accept them.”

It was a short answer and a straightforward decision.

Clay immediately lowered his head.

“Thank you very much.”

It wasn’t clear what he was thankful of.

Roan turned his head and looked at Chris.

“Did you say that the academy graduates who received Principal Fred Brown’s recommendations have came?”

“Yes. We have checked the recommendations and deployed them to administration works for now.”

Chris swiftly answered as he checked the memo.

The number of academy graduates who Principal Fred Brown had recommended were more than they had thought.

Even excluding the people who realized something after visiting Roan and abruptly left, quite a large number of graduates came to Tale Barony.

Most of them, after looking at the small and shabby Tale Barony, were disappointed greatly and left without regret.

But even amongst them, tens of distinguished talents stayed and were handling administration works.

“I should go meet them personally.”

There was a need to meticulously discuss the plan concerned with establishing an academy.

Roan inhaled deeply and gazed around the meeting room.

“Then, are the pressing matters all finished?”

At those words, Clay raised his right hand again.

“There is one more thing.”

He checked the content of a memo for a moment and then continued to speak.

“Mages have came from a place called Reno school.”

The moment his words ended, the people sitting with them tilted their heads.

“Reno school?”

“There’s a school like that?”

“It’s a first time I’m hearing it……?”

Even Chris’ expression was full of questions.

On the other hand, Roan’s expression was greatly calm.

‘If it’s the Reno school, it was a school that studied various subjects instead of a one subject. They were more on the side of manufacturing magic tools rather than personally using magic.’

He clearly remembered.

There was a reasonable reason for it.

‘Even in the last life, they attempted all kinds of endeavors to bring prosperity to the school.’

The endeavors led to results.

They had received sponsorship from many nobles and big merchants.

But.

‘After the Great Warring Era began, they became despised.’

There was no one who would pay patronage to the Reno school that couldn’t become any help in war.

No, there wasn’t even a room to do so.

‘In such situation, the Reno school’s last master McCrum, he whose talent at least was recognized as the best, became too greedy in his efforts to prosper the school.’

He had tried to turned the Reno school’s magic technologies into weapons of war.

The result was.

‘A great explosion.’

The tens and hundreds of magic arrays carved for the weapons of war began to rampage on their own.

An enormous amount of mana rippled unstably, and a great explosion soon occurred.

The aftereffect of the great explosion was colossal.

The entirety of a small city that McCrum’s research lab was in evaporated completely.

‘McCrum also died at that time and the Reno school’s life ended.’

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

‘Reno school……’

Complicated thoughts and plans surged within his head like a wave.

He soon shook his head and looked at Clay.

“Guide them to the reception room. I will go meet them directly.”

“Yes. Understood.”

Clay lowered his head slightly as he answered.

With that, the meeting was over.

The retainers, to carry out the missions each undertook, quickened their steps.

Roan also moved his steps towards the reception room.

When he opened the door, he saw the simple scenery inside of the reception room.

At the center table, a white-haired old man and an adolescent young man sat.

‘So it’s them.’

The current master of the Reno school, Lemming Ade, and the one who blew away a small city in the last life, McCrum.

Making a cheerful smile, Roan looked at them.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Roan Tale.”

for those confused, Roan first left Simon’s mansion, then headed to Kallum’s mansion and disappeared from sight, and then appeared again from Kallum’s mansion and headed to his own house. ↩

Chapter 148




T/n (CSV): Sponsored chapter.

Update: The chapter for Tuesday will be a bit late.

“I’m Lemming Ade!”

“I’m McCrum!”

Lemming and McCrum unknowingly and suddenly stood up.

‘What the? Even though our ages seem same……’

McCrum gulped as he stared at Roan.

For some reason, his heart jolted.

‘He’s big.’

The first impression from seeing Roan.

It wasn’t that his body was big, but the pressure pouring out of his body was amazing.

Even so, it wasn’t as if Roan was violently spouting out a threatening pressure.

An air of dignity that naturally flowed out of his entire body.

That was clearly an aura of majesty.

‘How at such a young age……’

The one who was shocked wasn’t only McCrum.

‘It’s a pressure like a general who roamed the battlefield for decades.’

Staring at Roan, who was already exuding a presence of a great general, Lemming became speechless.

‘Would a man like this sponsor us?’

Putting aside self-confidence and looking at it objectively, the current Reno school was a useless school with nothing that was worth sponsoring.

“Nice to meet you. If you are Lemming Ade, then……”

Roan extended his right hand as he cautiously asked.

Lemming immediately grabbed the hand and made an awkward smile.

“I’m not a noble, sir. I was merely granted a surname as a head of a school.”

“I see.”

Roan slightly nodded his head and then also shook hands with McCrum.

‘So this very man is McCrum, who blew a small city away completely.’

He was a genius whose talent at least was the best but was born in a wrong era.

Roan offered seats to the two people and sat down on a chair on the opposite side.

“I wonder for what reason the famed sir mages came to find me.”

He went abruptly to the point.

Lemming and McCrum hesitated for a moment.

Especially Lemming, who had only been rejected by many people, couldn’t even raise his head.

In the end, the one who stepped up was McCrum.

“I know that it’s shameless to say this after coming so suddenly, but…… could you please sponsor us, Reno school?”

Blinking his eyes, he searched Roan’s face.

Roan gently smiled and didn’t show any notable reaction.

“Ah! Just a moment please.”

McCrum awkwardly smiled and took out the magic lamp from a large bag.

Tung.

When he put the lamp down on the table, a heavy sound echoed.

McCrum lightly glanced at Roan, then pressed the controller.

Paat!

Instantly, a small ball of light appeared inside the lamp.

“Hmm.”

Roan let out a quiet exclamation.

Even though the reception room was on the brighter side, blinding light shined out around the lamp.

“It’s the magic lamp we made.”

McCrum widely opened his chest.

Lemming, who was lowering his head deeply, also looked at Roan with a confident expression this time.

Roan brushed the lamp with a tip of his finger, then spoke in a calm voice.

“Does it use a magic stone?”

Instantly, McCrum’s face turned stiff.

‘Darn. To think he would recognize it instantly.’

A magic stone per lamp didn’t meet any profit.

It was the truth that he wanted to hide it until the end.

Of course, he had no plan to back off like that even so.

‘I will express our school’s development potential.’

McCrum purposely made a confident smile.

It was when he was just about to speak up.

“Anyway, it’s excellent. With just this, the people will no longer fear the dark.”

Roan suddenly nodded his head with a content look.

“Ye, yes!”

Lemming abruptly jumped up and shouted.

Abruptly shocked, McCrum looked at him once.

His look seemed to be asking to please keep some face.

“Hm.”

McCrum coughed and turned towards Roan again.

“That’s right. Although it needs to use a magic stone about the size of a fingernail because it’s still at the early developmental stage, it may be usable with just a wheat grain size, no a dust of magic stone if we repeat the research several……”

When his words reached about that point.

“Okay.”

Roan brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“I’ll sponsor it.”

“Yes?”

McCrum, who was rambling on and on, asked back with a completely surprised look.

Roan stared at him for a moment and then shook his head.

“No, instead of that……”

With a quiet voice, he spoke as if to whisper.

“I will build you a magic tower in the fief, so what do you think about researching as an affiliate of the barony instead?”

“As an affiliate of the barony?”

McCrum asked back with a shocked expression and turned to Lemming.

“Hmm.”

Lemming leaked out a quiet groan.

Currently, the number of magic schools in the Rinse Kingdom was thirteen in total.

Amongst them, the top five schools with the biggest factions were patronized by the kingdom.

The rest of the schools were each sponsored by nobles or various factions and were continuing their research.

Although most of them were sponsored, they did their researches independently and only few schools were affiliated to noble houses.

‘And even they are all affiliated with the houses of dukes.’

Because of that, there wasn’t any problem in seeing them as affiliated to the kingdom.

‘An affiliate to a house of baron……’

It was something historically unprecedented.

His contemplations went deeper.

Roan quietly stared at that sight, then took a step back.

“Since it’s a matter with the school’s future on the line, it shouldn’t be easy to come to a decision. Then, for now, I will sponsor the school. Please continue your research here and personally see, hear, and feel the Tale Barony. Let’s discuss today’s offer again at that time.”

At those words, Lemming and McCrum exchanged their gazes and then minutely nodded their heads.

Honestly, it was a good condition that couldn’t be better for them.

The two people deeply lowered their heads towards Roan.

“Sir Baron Tale. Truly, thank you very much.”

“We’ll show you first if we get a good result.”

Roan cheerily smiled and lowered his head.

“Yes. I look forward to working with you.”

His voice was composed.

But inwardly, he was greatly pleased.

‘Reno school is exactly the magic school that I definitely need.’

If even the Reno school was added to the current alchemists and engineers’ unions, it felt as if an unbelievable product would be made.

Most of all.

‘If I mind and sponsor them, that tragic accident that blew away a city won’t happen.’

He thought that he could stop a big accident in advance.

Roan deeply inhaled.

The season was already Winter.

‘I will have to prepare the necessary things before Spring comes.’

He planned to finish the things that could be done before the crop seeds are planted.

A bright future of the Tale Barony was drawn inside his head.

‘The Great Warring Era isn’t far off.’

Although he had saved Manus Pershion and disgraced Reitas Pershion, he couldn’t guarantee that the Great Warring Era wouldn’t occur.

‘Since it occurred from too many events complicatedly mixing together.’

Three years from now at the latest.

If the Great Warring Era began, the starting point would be three years later.

‘At that time, the world will greatly change……’

His heart thumped strongly.

‘And I too will greatly change.’

Such thoughts vaguely appeared.

A bright light shined in his brown eyes.

*****

Kang! Kang! Kang!

Sounds of hammering rang out noisily.

The sun that soared above the heads pushed away the Mid Winter’s cold.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

Sounds of a bell echoed consecutively.

“Stop working! Stop working! It’s time to change shifts.”

“Let’s all go and eat some snacks!”

The men, who had been tirelessly carrying rocks, hammering, and sawing, brightly laughed and yelled.

They received and carried thick breads and warm tea, and sat around on a sunny lot.

“So we really built that?”

One man made a satisfied face as he stared at the stone wall that rose high to their right.

A young man who took a bite of bread spoke in a loud voice.

“Instead of Mediasis village, we’ll now have to call it Mediasis Castle.”

“Yeah, of course. The wall construction is proceeding on all four directions. It’s now a full-fledge castle, a castle.”

Another man enthusiastically agreed.

Another man scrunched the tip of his nose.

“But is it fine not to build a lord’s castle?”

“The lord said we need to build the castle walls first. We need to prepare for the monsters and enemy troops’ assaults.”

“But even so, the lord living in a shabby building is a bit……”

At those words, many people proudly smiled and spoke.

“Since our lord is someone who thinks of the fief’s citizens before himself.”

“He said our safety comes first before his own house.”

“So let’s quickly finish constructing the wall and build him a handsome lord’s castle.”

The mood was peaceful.

The young man who was eating the bread nodded his head and made a bright smile.

“I’m really glad I moved to the Tale fief. Since they’re separately giving wages and plentily take care of three meals and even a snack like this. Right now is a season that should be hungry and hard for a long time, but I’m spending it well thanks to our lord. I’m really glad I moved. Really.”

He was originally a person from Elton Coat Barony.

The people around him all nodded their heads.

The third month since Roan returned to the fief.

The season had passed the Mid Winter and was running towards Spring.

To the ordinary commoners, it was a season when things to eat decreased and people became impoverished.

But thanks to Roan carrying out various constructions and paying adequate wages, the citizens of the Tale Fief were able to live rather well-off lives unlike the citizens of other regions.

At that moment.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

The sound of bell noisily rang.

It wasn’t the bell sound that notified the change of shift.

Vvuuuuu!

Following that, a sound of horn was heard.

It was a signal that warned of an appearance of monsters or enemy troops.

However, the people didn’t show any panic.

“It seems monsters have appeared, right?”

“Didn’t the warning just now sounded from the castle gate on our side? If it’s from the west direction, monsters should be right.”

“I wonder which troop will march this time.”

It was a very relaxed and peaceful conversation.

They slowly stood up and headed towards the broad street that crossed through the castle.

On the street smoothly paved with stones, there originally were countless number of people crossing the street.

But now, as if they had promised, they were all moved to the sides of the broad street.

Simultaneously.

Dudududududududu.

The sound of horse hooves shaking the earth was heard.

Soon, a group of cavalry, with a troop flag at the lead, appeared from the end of the street.

The flag was embroidered with a panther’s face and design.

“Ah! It’s the Panther Troop.”

“It seems that the Panther Troop led by thousand-man commander Tane is marching this time.”

The people waved their hands at the troop that was bravely marching out.

The reason the passersby all moved to the sides of the street.

They had emptied out the street so that the troop could easily march through.

“Waaaaah!”

“Defeat the monsters!”

The children shouted with utterly excited faces.

Looking at those kids, the adults smiled pleasantly.

Vvuuuuuu!

The Panther Troop blew a magnificent horn as if in reply.

The men who came to watch from the construction sites headed towards the lot again while biting and eating their breads.

“There shouldn’t be any problem this time too, right?”

When the young man cautiously asked, the people around him all chortled out a laugh.

“Don’t ask something so obvious. Like always……”

“They’ll confidently defeat the monsters……”

“And return.”

They took turns looking at each other and brightly smiled.

Looking at that sight, the young man nodded his head.

“Right. That’s obvious. Since Tale Legion is……”

He stared towards the west where the Panther Troop marched and finished his words.

“Invincible.”

*****

Bang!

An explosion rang out.

An ugly stone statue that was placed at one side of a small lake comically exploded.

Bang! Bboom! Bang!

Explosions continued.

Each time, a stone statue explode out.

A white dust cloud blew up.

Paat!

One young man violently tore through within it.

Each time, a large splash of water soared.

A black spear moved as if dancing.

Bang!

Once again, another statue broke apart.

“Huu.”

The young man calmed his breath and spat out a long sigh.

As the dust that thickly blew up subsided, the young man’s face appeared.

Roan.

The young man’s identity was Roan.

With his shirt off, he was clearly showing off smooth muscles.

‘Certainly, it isn’t easy moving inside the water.’

Roan was currently at a small lake south of Mediasis village, no the Mediasis Castle, and was focusing on spearmanship training.

To make his movements a bit sharper, he had decided to train underwater.

The results were quite good.

His instantaneous velocity and balance became unrecognizably good.

Roan breathed in deeply.

His lungs felt cool.

‘I have absorbed almost all the mana from the Dion roots.’

The five Dion roots Simon gave as a present.

After returning to the Tale Fief, Roan immediately ate all of those roots.

In the three months afterwards, he had tirelessly trained the Flamdor Mana Technique and was able to make all the mana inside the Dion roots his.

‘Mana is steadily increasing.’

Now, he was able to at least faintly compress the mana.

Furthermore, the mana road inside his body became much more stronger and wider than before.

Even if he poured through a large amount of mana at once, it didn’t cause any difficulty.

‘The problem is the Flepsse Spearmanship……’

Roan lightly bit his lips.

The Flepsse Spearmanship was much more profound than he had thought.

To Roan, who only learned spearmanship techniques in actual battles and hadn’t learnt a proper spearmanship, there were many parts that were difficult to understand.

During the first ten days, he couldn’t even turn three pages of the spearmanship book.

‘It was good that there was at least Brian.’

Roan asked Brian for help.

He didn’t think it embarrassing to ask what he didn’t know and request teaching.

Brian, who was tinkering with the foundational mana technique, split his time and helped Roan out.

He, who had comprehensive knowledge in various training techniques, taught Roan the basics and foundation of of martial arts.

‘The things I called real battle spearmanship until now were in fact no more than buildings built upon sand.’

A situation where a building itself may be glamorous and large but may collapse entirely at a single moment.

It was a great fortune to be able to strengthen his foundation and basics at least now.

“Huu.”

Roan once again let out a long sigh and closed his eyes.

The water below his waist softly wrapped around his legs.

‘It’s comfortable.’

His mood was good.

One of the reasons that Roan didn’t stop underwater training.

When he dipped his body under water, the mana that moved harshly calmed down and his heart felt peaceful.

‘I thought that the Flamdor Mana Technique was incompatible with water, but……’

It was a hard to comprehend situation.

But right now, he didn’t want to think such complicated thoughts.

He wanted to feel the flow of water that softly wrapped around his entire body.

‘It’s nice……’

His mood naturally became good.

At that moment.

[Hey.] (t/n: Hey! Listen.)(e/n This is my alert for text messages/emails, I love that it annoys my friends.)

He heard a buzzing sound at the edge of his ears.

With his eyes closed, Roan frowned.

‘What the?’

He wondered if he heard wrong.

But.

[Hey! Can’t you hear me?]

He definitely heard a sharp voice at the edge of his ears.

[Just how many months is this. Just how can’t the guy who absorbed the spirit king’s tears not hear my voice?]

It was a grumbling sound.

With a surprised look, Roan abruptly opened his eyes.

He looked around himself, but there wasn’t anything his eyes saw.

“Did I hear wrong?”

He spoke in a quiet whisper.

Suddenly, he heard an extremely excited voice.

[So you can finally hear my voice!]

It was a voice as if a decade-old cold had suddenly disappeared. 1

Chapter 149




T/n (CSV): Thursday’s chapter. Sorry about Tuesday. I was feeling a bit sick this week.

“Is it her? That ridiculous candidate?”

“Yeah. Because of her, the spirit world completely flipped.”

“Was her name Kinis?”

Blue hair and transparent skin.

The ones gathered here and there and having barbed chats were water spirits who had rather large factions even within the spirit world.

Their gazes were all directed at one place.

An unusually blue hair and skin slightly tinted red.

A water spirit with a faint smile but an expression that somehow looked sad.

Her name was Kinis.

‘Say whatever you want. Since it’s not related to me.’

Kinis cared not for the gazes that poured down nor even the barbed chatters.

She purposefully walked even more confidently.

‘I didn’t become the Spirit King candidate because I wanted to like you.’

The candidates for the next Spirit King were chosen by the current Spirit King’s choices.

And traditionally, it was custom for the Spirit King candidates to be chosen from the bloodline that was called royalty even in the spirit world.

But.

‘I’m the lowest of the lower class.’

She didn’t even have parents who had given her power of the spirits and was born in the human world instead of the spirit world.

Perhaps because of that, she had a red tinted skin instead of a clear skin unlike other spirits.

‘Because of that, I was always alone.’

The other water spirits didn’t talked to Kinis, whose birth was of lower-class and even her looks were different.

Kinis too, besides when she first entered the spirit world, didn’t try to start a conversation first.

She couldn’t handle the other spirits’ cold looks and apathy.

The meaningless and lonely life that no one bothered with started like that.

But.

‘After the spirit king chose me for the next spirit king candidate, everything changed.’

The other spirits, who treated her as a nonexistent spirit, began to pour out all sort of envy and jealousy.

The biting words and pointings were at least on the nicer side.

The occurrences of stealing and harassing became frequent.

‘I don’t care. I don’t care.’

Kinis clenched her teeth.

‘I was alone anyway, and I’ll always be alone.’

Spirit King?

She had no interest in such a thing.

No, in her honest feelings, she wanted to boastfully become the Spirit King.

But.

‘In the first place, it’s ridiculous that I, who is from a lowly class, would become the Spirit King.’

There were plenty of spirits of royal background amongst the candidates.

Probably, one of them would become the next Spirit King.

‘I was selected just to make up the numbers.’

A short sigh leaked out.

Kinis hurried her steps and headed towards the Spirit King Ellaim’s residence.

“I received King Ellaim’s call and came.”

When she lowered her head in front of a grand door, the door soon opened.

When she stepped on the fluffy cloud floor and walked inside, there was a chair made out of water.

On the chair, a beautiful woman with a long blue hair sat.

She was Ellaim, the very Water Spirit King who traveled the human world with the Queen of Water Biate and who had saved Roan’s life.

‘Beautiful.’

The moment Kinis saw Ellaim, she became half dazed.

Because she was of a low class and hadn’t grown yet, she was merely about the size of a palm.

It was a look more like a small fairy than a woman.

Compared to that, Ellaim’s look was literally that of a perfect woman.

A beautiful face and smooth figure and, most of all, an aloof grace that exuded from her entire body.

It was a beautiful look that even Kinis, who was of the same gender, would fall for.

‘Yeah. The beings exactly like that become the Spirit King. It’s a place that a lowly birth like me……’

Looking at her own skin tinted with a red light, Kinis dropped her head.

‘Can’t even dream of.’

When her thoughts had reached that point.

“Kinis. You’re slightly late.”

She heard a beautiful voice.

Kinis raised her head and looked at Ellaim.

“Ah……”

A quiet exclamation flowed out.

With a faint smile, Ellaim was staring at Kinis.

“I, I”m sorry. I received the notice late.”

It was the truth.

The spirit who should had passed the news had dawdled.

This also was something that happened because of the envy and the jealousy.

“The other candidates have all went down to the human world and are taking the test.”

The candidate selection test.

The test to select the next Spirit King was simple.

Contracting with a human who realized the essence of water or absorbed the essence of water, and staying together with that human.

That was all.

What they had to do, what they shouldn’t do, how long was the duration…… there was nothing that was revealed.

Ellaim spun her finger in a circle.

Instantly, a clear drop of water rose in front of Kinis.

“He is the human you will contract with.”

On the drop of water, a man’s face appeared.

A young but manly face.

It was Roan.

“I hope that it will become a good result, no a good relationship.”

Ellaim cheerfully smiled.

Kinis quietly lowered her head and then closed her eyes.

Paat!

Water erupted around her, and soon, she disappeared.

When she opened her eyes again, the scenery had changed.

At that moment.

“I will make a completely new troop for you.”

She heard a dignified and low voice.

Kinis quickly turned her head and looked for the owner of the voice.

A fine looking elderly old man.

He was Count Io Lancephil.

Io was staring with a burning light in his eyes at the young man in front of him.

Kinis’ gaze naturally moved following that light.

“Ah……”

The young man, he was the human that she had to contract with.

“Troop commander Roan. Will you use Rose as the name of the troop?”

The young man, Roan looked to be momentarily in thought.

‘Is his name Roan?’

Kinis flew up into the air and stood up on top of Roan’s shoulder.

‘He should be a human who has either realized the essence of water or absorbed it, but……’

Strangely, she couldn’t feel the aura of water very well.

At that moment, Roan, who had been in thought, shook his head.

“I want to use another name.”

“Did you think of something?”

At Io’s words, Roan stared at the eyes of the soldiers around him.

“Amaranth, we will be the Amaranth troop.”

He spoke in a low but powerful voice.

Kinis, at the burning heat that flew out from Roan’s body, flew up into the air in shock.

For a one who realized or absorbed the essence of water, the heat was too strong.

But strangely, it wasn’t uncomfortable or painful.

Kinis quietly stared at Roan’s face, no, more exactly at his eyes.

Deep eyes as if one may fall in.

At her appearance reflected on the eyes, she exhaled up a long sigh.

‘In the first place, I’m not interested at all in something like Spirit King.’

No, in the first place, it was a dream she couldn’t even dream of.

Now that it had became like this, she planned to just follow the contractor and go sightseeing the world.

‘To do that, I have to make a contract first……’

Kinis flew up to Roan’s ear.

She planned to talk to him.

But Roan couldn’t hear Kinis’ voice.

And like that, the time flew by as if it had no regret.

[You couldn’t even see me or hear my voice. Thanks to that, I couldn’t even form the contract until now.]

The sharp voice tore through Roan’s ears.

Roan listened to Kinis’ story that went on for a long time, then fell into thought.

‘As expected, that water drop I absorbed at Biate’s cave was the essence of water.’

A disparate strength that was different than the heat within his body.

It was a moment when its identity became clear.

“Then were you always next to me since then to now?”

Roan stared at an empty space.

He still couldn’t see Kinis’ appearance.

For now, hearing her voice and talking with her was the best he could do.

[Of course. Since that’s my mission.]

“Wasn’t it lonely?”

Roan’s voice quieted down.

With a gruff voice, Kinis replied.

[Not at all! I wasn’t lonely!]

Her red-tinted skin became even redder.

‘Since I was always alone.’

She tightly swallowed back those last words.

She forcefully changed the subject.

[Anyhow, for a guy who even absorbed the essence of water, how could the aura of water be so faint like this?]

Because of that, it had been impossible for the two to converse.

At least because Roan had been more or less living in the water recently, it felt as if the essence of water inside his body became strengthened.

Thanks to that, at least having a conversation became possible.

‘Is the reason the aura of water is faint probably because of that……’

Roan inwardly had a guess.

“It’s probably because of the Flamdor Mana Technique.”

[Flamor Mana Technique?]

Kinis’ voice was full of questions.

For a while, Roan explained about the Flamdor Mana Technique.

[Hhm. So that amazing heat I felt from time to time was because of the Flamdor Mana Technique.]

Her voice sounded as if the questions were resolved.

At that moment, Roan slightly creased his forehead.

“But are you okay?”

[With what?]

Kinis gruffly asked back.

“You are a water spirit. Shouldn’t you be avoiding strong heat like the Flamdor Mana Technique?”

[Hm?]

Come to think of it, that was true.

Fire and water were opposites.

At least in the case of other water spirits, they would feel greatly pained and run away if there was even a bonfire level of heat.

But.

[I’m fine?]

Hot.

She simply felt only that much of a heat.

“Is it? Then that’s good.”

Roan nodded his head with an expression that seemingly found it trivial.

Because he didn’t knew the physiology of spirits very well, he hadn’t noticed just how strange that was.

“Then what do we need to do now?”

[The contract first. The contract.]

Kinis spoke with strength in each word.

Roan awkwardly smiled and nodded his head.

“Alright. Let’s make a contract.”

[Wait a bit.]

The contract was made instantly.

Although she originally needed to lay out all sorts of flowery and embarrassing words and then danced with a fluttery movements, Kinis completely skipped all those useless works.

‘He can’t see in the first place anyway.’

She pulled up the aura of water, then flew in front of Roan’s face.

Kinis extended her right hand and touched Roan’s forehead.

With her eyes closed, she murmured unintelligible words, then spoke in a sharp voice.

[You want to contract with me?]

Abruptly, she threw out those words.

“Un? What kind of contract is like this?”

Roan creased his brows.

From books and rumors, he roughly knew how a contract with a spirit was made.

He had thought that it was quite graceful and beautiful process, but.

‘This is shabbier than a slave contract.’

As if she had read Roan’s such thoughts, Kinis spoke in a blunt voice.

[You going to do it, or no?]

At the words that snap at him, Roan nodded his head.

“I’ll do it.”

Since there was the fault of making her wait for so long, he couldn’t be any more obstinate.

The instant he spoke those words, blue light wrapped around Roan and Kinis’ body.

However, Roan himself couldn’t see that light.

[It’s done.]

“It’s done?”

[Yeah. It’s done.]

“It’s really done?”

[Yeah! It’s really done!]

Kinis shouted aloud.

Somehow, her head ached.

It was the first time she talked with someone for so long.

The emotional stress was worse than she had thought.

Of course, her mood didn’t feel bad.

“Okay. Then I look forward to working with you.”

Roan extended his hand towards Kinis, who wasn’t even visible.

Kinis gently flew and stood on the tip of his finger.

[Looking forward or whatnot, increase your aura of water first. I’ll be seen only if you do, you know.]

“Okay. I got it. I’ll work hard.”

Roan cheerfully smiled as he nodded his head.

He moved his feet and walked out of the lake.

“Then what will you do from now on?”

[What do you mean do what. I’ll just have to sightsee the world and wait for the next Spirit King’s heir to be chosen.]

Roan, who was cleaning up his things while listening to Kinis’ story, shook his head towards her who he couldn’t even see.

“No. That’s not good.”

[What do you mean that’s not good?]

“You’re a full-fledged Spirit King candidate. Then you should confidently aim for the Spirit King’s position.”

Kinis snorted at Roan’s words.

[You didn’t listen to me, did you? I’m not a royalty but a lower class. And a lowly one at that. Me becoming the Spirit King is……]

“Impossible?”

Roan cut off her words and asked.

His face was rather serious.

Kinis wordlessly nodded her head.

But soon realizing that Roan couldn’t see her, she spoke in a quiet voice.

[Yeah.]

The moment she spoke those words, Roan faintly smiled.

He laid down on the ground and looked up at the blue sky.

“I’m from a commoner background. And a poor countryside village on the grain mountains at that. We were so poor that when it became early spring, we would have to dig up tree roots because there was nothing else left to eat. But the truly horrible things were the monsters who attacked regardless of day and night. We sent people to the fief lord several times, but they pretended not to know. Instead, they said all kinds of excuses and ripped off an unbelievable amount of tax. It was so difficult that I volunteered for the army as soon as I turned eighteen.”

The weight of his life could be felt in his voice.

“I wanted to become a great general. I wanted to be a great general, subjugate the monsters, and save the village.”

That was the truth.

But in the last life, he couldn’t quite reach the dream and died.

“Huu. But……”

A short sigh flowed out.

“As I roamed the battlefields and experienced the world, there was a countless number of villages like mine. It wasn’t that only my village was especially poor and dangerous. So I thought at that time. That this isn’t something that a great general could solve.”

This was something he felt as he lived the second life.

There was a world that he couldn’t see when he was barely living as a mere spearman.

At a level of a great general, it ended at a level of saving few villages.

To change the world, he had to look at a place higher than that.

‘At first, I had thought that if I aimed for a monarch, I would at least ended as a great general.’

The reason he wished to become a monarch when he returned to the past.

It truly was a childish and immature reason.

But as he went from a mere spearman to leading soldiers as a squad commander, adjutant, and vice-commander, his view of the world changed.

The life was too hard.

There were too many people who died without even follow their dreams.

He wished to save them all, to save the entire world.

To do that, he needed to become a true monarch.

Not a monarch of the royalty and the nobles, but the monarch of everyone.

That was the true monarch that Roan thought of.

It was because of that reason that despite becoming a noble, he looked after the people regardless of their status.

The dream that started for an immature reason had slowly shaped up like that.

“Kinis.”

Roan called out Kinis in a quiet voice.

He momentarily steadied his breath, then carefully spoke each and every word.

“I will become a monarch.”

This was the first time that Roan had told anyone, no, even spoke his dream out of his mouth.

Instantly, Kinis’ eyes became wide.

Her expression was shocked.

Even her, who was a spirit, knew a bit of how the human world’s lives worked.

‘It’s a ridiculous dream.’

Kinis shook her head.

Even in that while, Roan continued to speak.

“I’ll become a monarch and change the world.”

Roan’s eyes moved, chasing Kinis who couldn’t even be seen.

“Kinis. You said you also lived a hard life in the spirit world. Those days that you were ignored and discriminated because you were of a lower class…… don’t you want to try and change such an unreasonable world? If a candidate from the royalty becomes the next Spirit King as you said, the spirit world will be the same as before. The lower class will receive all kinds of slight and discrimination and live out difficult days. But……”

His voice once again carried strength.

“If you become the Spirit King, you can change the world.”

His voice was full of certainty.

Kinis’ heart began to rapidly race.

[I could change the world……]

If she could do that.

‘I’ll get rid all of these disgusting classes.’

But.

[Could I do it? Could I become the Spirit King? Me?]

Kinis asked in a trembling voice.

Raising up only his chest, Roan brightly smiled.

“Of course.”

It was an answer without a hint of doubt nor hesitation.

Once again, he extended his hand towards Kinis, who couldn’t even be seen.

“Kinis. I will become the monarch of this world. You become the king of the spirit world.”

[You and I will become kings……]

Be born at the lowest and rise to the highest place.

It definitely wasn’t an easy path.

But somehow.

‘I feel like I can do it.’

Until just a moment ago, she thought it was something absolutely impossible.

But the moment she conversed with Roan, an unknown confidence blossomed.

Kinis flew down on the back of Roan’s hand and slightly bent her knee.

Her small and cute lips touched the back of his hand.

Of course, Roan couldn’t feel nor see that sight.

[Alright. Let’s try it.]

It was still a sharp and buzzing voice, but it was full of life unlike before.

Roan cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

To him, a friend and a companion who walked the same dream as him had appeared today.

Roan stood up from his seat and picked up his bag.

Then, as if he had thought of something, he spoke in a careful voice.

“Ah! But were you really not lonely?”

Countless months of time that she had to talk alone, and watch alone.

Roan found it pitiable and sorry that Kinis had to spend and endure that time alone.

Smiling brightly, Kinis replied.

[Yeah. I’m not lonely anymore.]

Tale Barony (4) End.

Chapter 150




T/n (CSV): Regular chapter for Sunday. The freebie chapter (as a makeup for missing last Tuesday’s chapter) will be up soon in the morning.

Thankfully, only Roan could hear Kinis’ voice.

It was because there was no one amongst the retainers of the Baron Tale’s house who had a strong aura of water.

The one with the biggest possibility was Clay, who was a druid, but he also didn’t seem to be able to see nor hear Kinis.

‘That is, if he isn’t intentionally pretending to not see.’

Roan flashed light from his eyes as he stared at Clay, who was busily moving about.

“We need a few more spy eagles and messenger pigeons.”

“Tenebra troop has requested three infiltration cats.”

“Agens has asked whether we could tame insects and fishes.”

Clamorous conversations continued on.

As the administrator of the fief and the director of the newly launched Bureau of Druids, Clay was passing busy days.

Particularly, the work he was putting his heart and blood into these days was indoctrinating various animals and birds with the newly appointed druids and assigning them to various departments.

“Since we will ready the three infiltration cats five days later, tell them to send over the troopers who will be in charge of the mission. Pass on that we are still understaffed for the insects and fish.”

“Yes, sir. Understood.”

At Clay’s reply, a young man in a uniform, with a loud answer, exited the office of administration.

Roan, who had been watching, faintly smiled and grabbed Clay’s shoulder.

“Seeing you being so hectically busy, I really feel sorry.”

It was true.

Currently, the administration of the Tale Barony was almost all shouldered and managed by Clay.

And with the works of the Bureau of Druids getting stacked on on top of that, his daily hours of sleep these days didn’t quite go over three hours.

With a tired, but somewhat proud and satisfied look, Clay replied.

“If you are that sorry, then please increase my rank at least.”

Serious words half mixed with a joke.

To someone who might be meeting Clay for the first time, they were words that might easily make one flustered.

But Roan now more or less understood his personality.

“Sure. I’ll officially bring it up at the monthly meeting.”

Just looking at the achievements, promotion was basically an established fact.

However, the promotions in the house of Baron Tale wasn’t something that could be done with just achievements.

‘I should get and see Agens’ human resources report.’

Agens, the Tale Barony’s greatest intelligence agency, currently was also taking on employee evaluations of the Baron Tale House’s retainers in addition to collecting and analyzing both the domestic and foreign information.

It also included the basic information that are unrelated to their job performance such as diligence, everyday manner, and reputation.

“Thank you very much.”

Clay smiled as he bowed his head.

He was excessively honest in parts like this.

He didn’t particularly hide his ambition.

Although that was awkward at first, he now thought instead that it too was Clay’s charm and a positive point.

‘Of course, I’m not sure whether he really isn’t hiding anything.’

All of a sudden, he recalled the story Princess Aily had said before leaving the capital, Miller.

Please don’t give him all of sir Baron’s trust. To me, Clay’s heart can’t be seen. I can’t tell whether its inside is black, or white. This kind of case is a first.

‘She certainly said so.’

Meaning not to trust him too much.

‘Come to think of it, I wonder how the princess is doing……’

The end of his thought continued naturally on towards that direction.

The thoughts about Clay had already long disappeared a far away.

At that moment.

[Hey. What are you thinking?]

He heard a sharp voice.

It was Kinis.

“Un?”

Unknowingly widening his eyes round, Roan asked back.

“Yes?”

Awkwardly, Clay, who was facing him, asked back with a puzzled look.

[You idiot. I said you can’t just answer in front of other people.]

Kinis’ criticism followed.

Roan hurriedly calm his thoughts.

“No. I said I look forwards to your help from now on as well.”

“Yes, my lord. I will always do my best.”

As if to say not to worry, Clay lowered his head with a confident expression.

Roan tapped his shoulder several times, then went out of the office of administration.

“I panicked because you suddenly talked to me.”

Roan grumbled towards Kinis, who couldn’t even be seen.

[Cht cht cht. Always be alert.]

Her voice was pixieish.

Roan faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

The two people, no the one person and one spirit couldn’t converse with only thoughts and feelings yet.

To talk with not words but only thoughts, he needed to raise the aura of water to a much higher level.

[Anyway, what were you thinking back there.]

She seemed to be talking about when he was thinking of Aily.

“Just thoughts about this and that.”

Roan subtly avoided the question.

Kinis made an expression that seemed to say that it was suspicious.

Of course, Roan couldn’t see her.

[Suspicious. Your face was really strange. The light in your eyes were soft.]

“Don’t say something ridiculous.”

With a slightly flustered look, Roan waved at the air.

Kinis flew around here and there, and spoke in a sharp voice.

[Anyway, the expression back then wasn’t bad. You looked really happy.]

At those words, Roan flinched in shock.

‘I looked happy……?’

It somehow felt as if his feelings were exposed.

His footsteps pointlessly became hurried.

[What is it? Why are you hurrying so suddenly?]

With a surprised voice, Kinis asked on.

Smiling awkwardly, Roan quickened his steps.

“There is a mountain of things I need to do.”

It was a pointless excuse.

But it really was true that he was too busy to even blink.

The Tale Barony was no different than a newly born baby.

There weren’t just one or two things he had to be concerned with and look over.

[So where are you going?]

“The place where a shabby genius is.”

Roan answered shortly.

At those words, Kinis snorted out a laugh.

[Ah! The scatterbrain McCrum?]

Instead of an answer, Roan made a faint smile.

His steps led towards the single story building, where a signboard called Reno Magic Tower was attached.

*****

Bang!

A middle aged man violently slammed down on a desk.

His face was full of annoyance.

“Damn it. What an eyesore this is.”

His voice was sharp-edged.

The man who was harshly breathing out was Viscount Kali Owells, who served Count Io Lancephil.

“The current situation?”

He looked at Perry Wilson, the captain of the Lancephil Fief Regiment, who sat on the opposite side of the desk. 1

Perry smiled bitterly.

“Following the border between our fief and the Tale Barony, big and small forts, camps, and watchtowers have been built.”

“And you just watched that happen?”

Kali berated with a voice mixed with irritation.

Perry answered with a protesting look.

“It was something we couldn’t do anything to in our position. The locations the forts, camps, and the watchtower were raised were all in Tale Barony. They are places we cannot enter without permission.”

Kali harshly ground his teeth.

“Building military facilities at the bounds touching our fief is a clear hostile action.”

His sight went towards Baron Tairon Bess, the head of the magic corp.

“Has there been any words from the lord?”

Here, the lord meant Io.

“He said to not mind it since it should be preparing for monsters’ activities.”

Tairon answered with a short sigh.

Bang!

Kali slammed the desk once more.

“Damn it! So he really reacted like that!”

There was no way that Io would put a brake in Roan’s work.

A chilly mood flowed.

“Commander Owells. If we leave Baron Tale as is, the entire Lancephil fief may go over.”

Perry’s words.

He couldn’t dismiss it as groundless words.

There was already a case where Io had simply cut off a part of the southern region, including the Tale region, of the Lancephil County and gave it to Roan.

‘To me, who had served by his side for decades, he hasn’t even granted me a proper fief.’

Kali’s goal was to succeed Io, who had no blood relative, and become the lord of the Lancephil County.

But with the current situation, the possibility that Roan would become the next lord of the Lancephil County was high.

“No. I can’t leave it be like that.”

His voice was cold.

Kali looked back and forth between Tairon and Perry.

“I will have to once again send someone to Count Chase.”

Kali and Count Jonathan Chase forming a secret relations was something that happened long time ago.

When Io had cut off and gave the Tale region to Roan.

At that time, they had already exchanged letters in secret.

“Have you made up your resolve?”

“Are we finally starting?”

Tairon and Perry asked back with nervous expressions.

With a heavy expression, Kali nodded his head.

“If he won’t give it to me, I’ll just have to take it……”

And he would have to take it before another bastard cleanly snatch it away.

He had confidence.

‘If we attack from the inside and the outside, even the lord, no, Count Io Lancephil will not be able to endure.’

The chaos from the inside will be done by himself, Tairon, and Perry.

The chaos from the outside.

‘Count Jonathan Chase, the hated rival of Count Lancephil.’

He will take care of it.

A vicious smile hung from Kali’s mouth.

A cold light wrapped around his eyes.

The ambition within his heart was simply too big.

That ambition was so big, it covered the eyes of both his body and heart.

Because of that, he had not seen the most important thing within a life.

Family.

What kind of impact would this great and important existence make in this event?

*****

“Where was the controller. Ah! Here it is!”

McCrum hurriedly rushed.

It was because he became slightly nervous from having Roan, who suddenly visited, in front of him.

No, it was because there was a bit of scatterbrain side to his original personally.

He pressed hard on the controller.

Paat!

Instantly, a ball of light appeared within a small lamp.

“It’s a magic lamp that runs on a much smaller magic stone than we had first shown you.”

“How big a stone went in it?”

“About a half a fingernail big, sir.”

McCrum answered shortly.

A blush shined on his face.

Certainly, the size of the magic stone had decreased to about half from the original magic lamp.

But the price of a magic stone the size of half a fingernail was also incredible.

‘It’s extravagant. Extravagant. To think we’ll need this much magic stone to light a single lamp……’

McCrum lowered his head in self embarrassment.

No, he tried to lower his head.

But the moment he saw Lemming Ade standing next to him, he forcefully raised his head.

To the person who was the head of the school, the master of the magic tower, and the teacher who saved his life, he didn’t wish to show an ugly look.

“Is this much the best?”

It wasn’t a voice pressuring people.

They were words truly out of curiosity.

At Roan’s question, McCrum raised his head stiffly and answered in a strong voice.

“According to our research, it needs to work at the one tenth the size of current magic stone. But when we carry out the actual experiment, it simply doesn’t show any reaction, and……”

When his words reached about that point.

Pssh.

With a feeble sound, the ball of light within the lamp disappeared.

“The current magic lamp’s activation state is also very unstable.”

Roan slowly nodded his head and then examined the magic lamp.

Following the surface of the lamp, countlessly many magic arrays were complicatedly drawn, no, were carved.

[Hihihi. Look at this! Kukku.]

Suddenly, he heard Kinis’ laughter.

Slightly creasing his brows, Roan glanced at McCrum and Lemming’s faces and then murmured in a very quiet voice.

“What do you mean?”

At those words, Kinis’ voice was soon heard.

[Ah right! You can’t see me. Look here below the lamp. I know McCrum was a scatterbrain, but isn’t this too much?]

Roan naturally moved his gaze.

“Ah……”

Reflexively, he let out a quiet exclamation.

Soon, Kinis’ voice was heard.

[It’s serious even when you look at it. The magic array carved around the base of the lamp is at a level of a child’s doodle.]

Roan slowly nodded his head.

They weren’t talking about the formula of the magic array.

Roan certainly couldn’t understand that and neither could Kinis.

They were completely inexperienced in formula of magic arrays.

Level of a child’s doodle.

That was actually talking about the shape of the magic array etched on the lamp’s surface.

For magic arrays that included complicated formulas, each and every line, shape, pattern, and words were important.

If they became even slightly bent, the magic itself will not activate or become unstable.

But.

‘They’re squiggly.’

The lines of the magic arrays etched at the base of the magic lamps were lopsided, the shapes were squashed, the patterns were comical, and the words were spiking out this way and that.

Of course, that was an extremely detailed part that was hard to see unless one concentrated one’s gaze.

But.

‘It seems it’s because of this that the result much below the actual research came out.’

When Roan looked over the lamp for a long time, McCrum awkwardly smiled as he opened his mouth.

“Carving the magic array at the base of the lamp was a rather difficult job, so……”

He too had noticed what Roan was currently looking at.

Roan turned his gaze and looked at McCrum.

“If we can just carve the magic array more precisely, would the activation results improve?”

At those words, McCrum contemplated for a moment, then slightly nodded his head.

“It probably will, sir.”

His face seemed to say that they wouldn’t know until they try.

“Hmm.”

Roan leaked a quiet groan.

‘Then there is a way.’

He cheerfully smiled and looked back and forth between McCrum and Lemming.

“Let’s take this magic lamp and go with me.”

“Eh? To where……?”

McCrum asked back with a confused look.

Instead of answering, Roan cheerfully smiled and walked towards the outside of the magic tower.

McCrum and Lemming stared still at that sight for a moment and then soon gathered the magic lamp and the controller and followed Roan’s back.

Roan exited the magic tower and headed towards the outskirt of the Mediasis Castle.

“Lord. Have a nice day.”

“Have some fruits.”

“Thank you always.”

The castle’s residents on the streets greeted them with bright faces.

And each time, Roan slightly lowered his head and responded back.

‘Was there a noble this popular?’

‘He really is amazing in many ways.’

McCrum and Lemming, who were following behind, inwardly shook their heads in awe.

Even during that while, the three people busily moved their feet.

Kang! Kang! Kang!

When they finally reached the west gate, loud sound of hammer was heard.

Roan briefly glanced back at McCrum and Lemming following behind, and made a faint smile.

“This here is the Tale Engineering Union. It’s a place that’s usually called the Hammer Engineering Union.”

“Ah……”

McCrum and Lemming let out a quiet exclamation.

They had also heard of the rumors of Tale Engineering Union.

A place where skilled engineers from all over the kingdom gathered and were associated, it was the institution that was responsible for the various constructions currently happening all over the Tale Barony.

“Director Biggs.”

At Roan’s call, a man with a red face ran up.

“Hahaha! Lord. Welcome.”

A hearty laugh and straightforward attitude.

He was Biggs, the very man who was the director of the engineering union.

“There’s something I need to request.”

“If it’s our lord’s request, then of course we will listen to anything.”

At Roan’s words, Biggs energetically thumped his broad chest.

Roan cheerfully smiled and turned towards McCrum.

“Ah……”

McCrum instantly realized Roan’s intention.

He handed the magic lamp that he was holding to Biggs.

“What’s this lamp?”

At the unexpected object, Biggs slightly creased his forehead.

With a calm voice, Roan replied.

“It’s an object called the magic lamp. It’s an object with complicated magic arrays etched onto the lamp’s surface.”

“Hhm.”

Biggs nodded his head and meticulously looked over the lamp’s surface.

The magic arrays that weren’t very visible were faintly seen.

Biggs, after looking at it close for a long while, tilted his head.

“Is this something that’s originally etched squiggly like this?”

His expression was greatly confused.

“Hhm.”

Vainly embarrassed, McCrum and Lemming coughed.

‘As expected, he recognized it instantly.’

Roan inwardly smiled proudly, and shook his head.

“No. It’s like that because the work on that part isn’t easy.”

“Ah……”

As if he now understood, Biggs let out a low exclamation.

“So the thing you want to request is to etch this magic array?”

“Yeah. Would it be possible?”

Roan asked with a cautious voice.

Biggs looked over the lamp and answered.

“The shape of the magic array is seriously complicated, but……”

Soon, a smile bloomed on his mouth.

“We can easily carve something of this much.”

“Ah……”

Soon as he spoke those words, McCrum and Lemming let out a quiet exclamation.

Roan cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

“Then. I’ll request it of you.”

“Please leave it to us.”

Biggs answered with a loud voice.

Roan turned around to the back and looked at McCrum and Lemming.

“Please let Director Biggs know what kind of magic array is needed to be carved.”

“Yes. We understand.”

McCrum instantly nodded his head.

On his face, a strange expectation floated.

He felt that if they could carve the magic array a bit more precisely, they could make a much more effective magic lamp than now.

McCrum, together with Lemming, moved his feet and approached Biggs.

Roan proudly smiled as he watched that sight.

‘A meeting of the mages and the engineering union……’

For now, he had succeeded in one union.

‘And if even the alchemists continue their research together here……’

When his thought reached that point.

“My lord!”

From far away, he heard a familiar voice.

And soon.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

The sound of the ground trembling hit his ears.

Without even looking back, Roan was able to guess the owner of the voice.

‘Brian.’

A faint smile hung from his mouth.

Slowly, he turned his head.

Sure enough, Brian, who had equipped a heavy armor, was running towards him from the entrance of the engineering union.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

Every time he stepped on foot forwards, the ground shook.

When he met Roan’s gaze, Brian raised up his right hand high.

“My lord! We completed it!”

His voice was completely excited.

On the tip of his hands was a bundle of paper.

Once again, he shouted out aloud at the top of his voice.

“The Tale Mana Technique has finally been completed!” (e/n: this gave me shivers.)

Chapter 151




T/n (CSV): A freebie chapter as a makeup for missing last Tuesday’s chapter.

‘Excellent.’

Roan was truly awed.

The Tale Mana Technique that Brian had brought, no, created, was truly excellent even when Roan, who it hadn’t been very long since he began to study the principles martial arts and techniques, saw it.

“I picked out only the core parts of the Rinse Kingdom’s Batelein Mana Technique, Byron Kingdom’s Vasis Mana Technique, and Istel Kingdom’s Datio Mana Technique, and made a foundational technique book. And to make the mana accumulation possible, I added in here the the most foundational and solid technique principles amongst the mana techniques I know.”

His expression was confident.

Roan nodded his head and asked in a cautious voice.

“And the stability?”

However it was, the Tale Mana Technique was something made by combining multiple mana techniques.

If not careful, a situation where one lose stability and rampage just like Brian, who had learned many mana techniques, could happen.

Brian shook his hand as if to say not to worry.

“There’s no problem. Because creating a solid foundational technique style was the goal in the first place, I have definitely excluded those with strong color of its own that may harm the mana technique’s balance. The Tale Mana Technique is, word for word……”

For a moment, he contemplated to find the suitable analogy.

“Should I say that it was made by combining waters, each from a different water source? Although the taste, color, and component may be slightly different, they’re water in the end. I haven’t mixed something like wine or tea.”

At those words, Roan nodded his head.

To mix various types of water.

He could more or less understand what that meant.

But.

“How is its level?”

If it was made by only mixing water, it could also be excessively tasteless.

Meaning, if he had made the mana technique by picking only the basic and foundational things, there is a possibility that its level may be low.

Brian’s face became even brighter.

“When I made it by combining basics and basics, a mana technique of a much higher level was completed.”

Of course, even so, it didn’t mean that it was more outstanding than the traditional mana technique that distinguished noble houses retained.

But just from looking at the developmental potential, the Tale Mana Technique was much more excellent.

That was what Brian thought.

“There is a word that the end of technique was the basics. I couldn’t understand that word in the past, but through the opportunity this time, I have clearly realized it.”

His eyes flashed with light.

‘So there is something he earned.’

Roan realized that Brian had grown a step further.

When he inserted mana into Kalian’s Tears, the entire world was soon colored in a golden light.

‘Hmm.’

Roan leaked out a quiet murmur.

The flow of mana inside Brian’s body was slightly different than before.

‘Should I say that the mana that was dangerous and seemingly about to rampage at any moment has regained its calm……?’

At that moment.

“Although I did follow my lord’s order and stopped training the mana technique that they taught at the palace, it’s true that I was actually a little worried. Since the level of mana also remains at the same place if one doesn’t train mana technique.”

Roan quietly nodded his head.

Although he did stop the mana technique training for the moment to stop the mana rampage, he couldn’t stop the training indefinitely.

“At that time, I made the Tale Mana Technique and trained it as a test.”

The tips of Brian’s mouth slightly went up.

“Although the mana accumulation speed was slower than the mana technique I trained before, it certainly was stable. Most of all, the flow of mana, which flowed unstably and seemingly about to break off, has began to flow smoothly like a river. My lord. The Tale Mana Technique may somehow untie the knot that has tangled within me.”

The words were a supposition, but it felt as if he was already certain.

Roan brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“That’s good. That’s really good.”

In the first place, he had felt sorry because it seemed that he wasn’t able to give a proper help until now.

And for Brain to find a breakthrough by himself in that situation, he was truly proud of him.

“It’s all thanks to my lord. The one who told me that there was a problem in my mana technique was my lord, and the one who gave me a chance to look over again from the basics of training was also my lord. Truly, thank you very much.”

Brian deeply lowered his head.

Smiling faintly, Roan shook his hand.

“No. I haven’t done anything. These are all something achieved on your own.”

He stared straight into Brian’s eyes.

“Brian. You can have more confidence in yourself than now.”

Although his voice was calm, it couldn’t hide the burning sentiments.

“Because you are the best amongst the knights I have seen.”

“My lord……”

With a deeply moved expression, Brian dropped his head.

There was nothing more heartwarming and delightful than being recognized by the person one served.

Roan tapped Brain’s shoulder, and then took up the bundle of papers containing the Tale Mana Technique.

“For now, we will have to select people suitable for mana technique training.”

If he could, he wished to teach the mana technique to the entire legion’s soldiers, but realistically, that was something very difficult.

First, one must knew how to read and write to learn the mana technique, and their loyalty to the Baron Tale’s House had to be deep.

‘I need to make a selection test.’

A fair selection process was needed.

A soldier couldn’t be unconditionally selected just because they had been together for a long time.

He wanted to give a hope that anyone can learn the mana technique through a just process if one strived.

‘I will have to go see them.’

For the work this time, there were suitable geniuses.

“Brian. I plan to entrust the soldiers’ mana technique training to you.”

Brian, who had been sitting, instantly stood up and gave a short salute.

“Please leave it to me.”

To teach someone.

That wasn’t a one-sided action.

At the same time as teaching, there were many things one learned.

Roan tapped Brian’s shoulder and then moved his feet.

[Where are you going now?]

Kinis asked with a grouchy tone.

Thanks to Roan, who had moved without a rest the entire day, she too had to restlessly fly around.

Putting Brian behind him, Roan hurried his steps.

“The place you hate the most.”

At those words, Kinis frowned.

[That place without a single bit of water and full of book smell?]

“Yeah. That’s it. We’re going to the Academy Bureau.”

The institution that the academy graduates, who came to the Tale Barony from Principal Fred Brown’s recommendations, belonged to.

Although the name was grandly called the Academy Bureau, there essentially wasn’t a single academy that they operated just yet.

The construction of the academy was experiencing a difficulty.

It wasn’t something that could be made instantly just because someone had money.

Unlike a market or a factory, it wasn’t a place that could be managed in a general manner either.

Education.

The weight that gave was much heavier than he had thought.

‘We’re teaching words to the legion’s soldiers for now, but……’

The officers of the Academy Bureau had been greatly restless on their own.

It was because there was absolutely no progress in their main job of building and managing the academy.

‘The selection test may ease that restlessness.’

The feeling of relief that they had received some important mission.

Roan wished to lighten their feelings of responsibility a little.

[Uagh! Book smell!]

Kinis yelled in a sharp voice.

In no time, the Academy Bureau was in front of their eyes.

*****

It was certainly a space that Kinis would more than hate.

The inside of a single story building was entirely filled with books.

Because there wasn’t a single bit of humidity, a musty smell stabbed their noses.

[Uah. Let’s finish it swiftly and quickly get out.]

Kinis cried out.

Not minding her, Roan stared at the young men buried beneath the piles of books.

Putting their heads together, tens of young men were debating violently.

“It’s a selection test to select soldiers who’ll learn mana technique. There’s no need to put in political philosophy in a test like that!”

“What are you talking about! To learn mana technique is to become a knight! Don’t you know politics is indispensable to a knight?”

“That’s for ordinary cases. The positions of our fief’s soldiers are different.”

“Right. The idea that one absolutely becomes a knight just because one learned mana technique is a stereotype!”

They had became completely absorbed in the task called the selection test that Roan had thrown.

It was as if a fire had been lit on a pile of completely dry hay.

‘It should be fine to trust and leave it to them.’

Roan realized that there was no need to particularly continue watch any longer.

[Let’s get out quickly, quickly.]

Kinis repeatedly let out words hurrying him.

Snickering out a laugh, Roan carefully exited the bureau building.

Without even realizing that Roan had disappeared, the Academy Bureau’s officers continued their heated debate.

[Huuah!]

As soon as they went outside, Kinis breathed in deeply.

Listening to that sound, Roan shrugged his shoulders.

“You can even handle the Flamdor Mana Technique’s heat, but can’t take just that level of space?”

[Don’t know. I’m fine at times, and find it difficult at other times.]

Kinis shook her head left and right.

Roan snickered and moved his feet.

“If it was that hard, couldn’t you have just stayed outside by yourself?”

It was still impossible to move far away because Roan’s level of aura of water was low, but it was more than possible to stay apart about a building or two away.

[Tha, that’s……]

Kinis couldn’t easily continue her words.

‘I don’t want to separate from you!’

Such words went up to her throat.

But she endured it hard.

It was still embarrassing to say such words.

“What? Why did you stop talking?”

[Fo, forget it! Anyhow, are the works for today all finished?]

Her voice was sharp.

Roan couldn’t understand Kinis, who suddenly yelled, but didn’t particularly ask.

“For now, today is done. But it probably will become more busy from now on?”

Tale Mana Technique training, Bureau of Druid’s animal assignment mission, Academy Bureau’s selection test mission, the engineering union and the magic tower’s research as well as various constructions and troop drilling……

The amount of things he had to do was like a mountain.

Roan inhaled deeply.

Coincidently, the north wind blew.

The tip of the wind was slightly tinted with the scent of Spring.

Just like that, the season was preparing to change its clothes.

*****

“Kuku. A happy news has arrived for once.”

Count Jonathan Chase held a letter and let out an abhorrent laugh.

The fully exposed teeth took light and flashed.

His mood was just that good.

“Is it Kali Owells?”

The butler of the Count Chase’s house, Chandler Hoose cautiously asked.

Putting the letter he held into a drawer, Jonathan nodded his head.

“He finally made up a resolve.”

Leaning back into his chair, he spat out a long sigh.

“Finally, I can throw Io Lancephil, that old man, down into hell.”

A laughter kept on coming out.

With a cautious attitude, Chandler asked.

“Wouldn’t it be difficult if a fief war started in the current situation?”

Even without it, the mood was tense from the throne succession competition.

“I’ll have to set up the board beforehand.”

Currently in case of Jonathan, he was widely known as the right-hand man of the Second Prince Tommy Rinse.

But in truth, the prince he served was the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

“If I attack the Lancephil fief, Prince Simon will stand up.”

Io was one of the rather large power amongst the nobles who followed Simon.

There was no way that Simon would just watch.

“I only need to coax Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum well and check Prince Simon.”

In the first place, in the two princes’ positions, there was a need to hold back Simon’s ankle, who was walking ahead by himself.

“So it will get busy from now on.”

Jonathan nodded his head at Chandler’s words.

“Since I have to grab the chance when it comes.”

It wasn’t possible to know when a chance like this would come again.

Tapping the desk with a tip of his finger, he formed a strange smile.

It felt as if his blood was rushing.

He could see the image of Io kneeling in front of his eyes.

‘Kali Owells. What a cute bastard.’

He was a truly likable bastard.

But.

‘I’ll have to clean him up later too.’

Jonathan had no plan to take in a dog who bit its owner. (e/n: Ahh, rewards a traitor truly deserves.)

Bastards like Kali had a possibility that they would betray him at any moment according to their ambition.

Jonathan knew the nature of those kind of bastards very well.

‘Since I too am that side’s person……’

The strange smile hanging on his mouth became much thicker.

*****

“It isn’t as easy I thought.”

Clay awkwardly smiled as he shook his head.

It was an expression unlike him, who was confident at everything.

“Even though purposely made the situation difficult and harassed him to the utmost, but he is still attached to the border gate guard troop.”

It was the story about Pichio.

Roan, who was receiving the report, slightly creased his brows.

“Harassed him?”

“Yes. We have incited the border gate captain Dose and have been harassing him. Since the attachment to that side has to fall off first.”

“Hmm.”

With a low groan, Roan shook his head.

“Let’s stop that work.”

“Eh? But wasn’t he someone my lord really liked? If we harassed him just a bit more……”

“No. It will be good to stop at this point. I can’t destroy a person’s life because of my greed.”

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

He stood up from his seat.

“Do you perhaps have a different plan?”

Clay cautiously asked.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“I’ll meet him directly.”

“With Pichio?”

“Yes. I plan to meet him and honestly ask. Whether he has any thought of being with me.”

Roan stared straight into Clay’s eyes.

The light in his eyes was steadfast and without waver.

He had already resolved his thought.

“Of course, before that……”

His voice was composed.

“I will have to apologize.”

He wanted to let Pichio know that he was absolutely not harassed because he was lacking and was problematic.

Clay kept silent for a moment and then slowly nodded his head.

“Certainly, that is like my lord.”

“Like me?”

Roan asked back with a confused look.

Smiling cheerily, Clay replied.

“Because my lord values people.”

At that moment.

[Please value not just people but spirits too.]

Kinis abruptly cut in.

Roan cheerfully smiled and moved his feet.

Now that he had made up his decision, there was no need to delay.

He planned to immediately go see Pichio.

‘He should be startled shocked……’

In the first place, Roan was infamous in the Istel Kingdom as the Crimson Ghost.

However, his prediction missed comically.

When Roan went to Pichio’s house under the cover of dark.

“As expected, you have come.”

Pichio was waiting for him with a calm face.

‘As expected, you have come?’

Roan was greatly shocked inwardly.

He and Pichio’s meeting was a fact that only Clay knew even in Baron Tale’s house.

“Did you know that I would come?”

At the cautiously asked words, Pichio shook his head.

“No. It wasn’t specifically you, but I felt that someone would come visit tonight. It might be hard to believe, but I just felt that kind of feeling.”

A bitter smile hung from his mouth.

As if this kind of thing happened quite often, the light in his eyes wasn’t that of hoping to be believed.

However, the sincerity that filled his eyes showed that what he said just now wasn’t a lie.

‘Is this that instinct……’

Roan inwardly nodded his head.

Clay’s judgment was correct.

Unlike others, Pichio’s sixth sense was unusually developed.

“Then you don’t know who I am?”

At the abruptly thrown question, Pichio, who had been making a bitter smile, made a slightly surprised face.

It was because Roan was the first who didn’t repeatedly ask back even after listening to his unbelievable words.

‘Does he trust my words?’

It was a fresh feeling.

Staring at Roan’s face, he exhaled a short sigh.

“I remember that you are Henry, a porter associated with Charity Trust. Of course, that’s probably a lie.”

Roan smiled bitterly at those words.

“Yes. That is a lie. Reluctantly, I had to hide my identity.”

On one hand, he was slightly shocked.

‘He remembered something that happened four months ago.’

There was merely two meetings.

And amongst those times, they had only talked once.

However, Pichio clearly remembered him.

Roan inhaled deeply, and then formally introduced himself.

“My real name is Roan Tale. I am a baron of the Rinse Kingdom.”

His voice was calm.

He thought that Pichio would be greatly shocked.

However, Pichio instead murmured quietly with a calm face.

“Ah…… as I thought, you are the Crimson Ghost.”

At those words, Roan made a surprised face.

“Could you tell even that kind of thing from your feelings?”

“No. About three months ago, a letter was sent from the capital to each border gate. It was a order to watch thoroughly because Baron Roan Tale of the Rinse Kingdom may pass through the border.”

“Ah……”

Roan nodded his head with a quiet exclamation.

The things he had done in the Pershion Kingdom must had reached the Istel Kingdom’s palace.

There were only two methods, either passing through the Byron Kingdom or the Istel Kingdom, to go from the Pershion Kingdom to the Rinse Kingdom.

The Istel Kingdom, in case Roan may possibly cross the border, had sent out an official order to strengthen the guard a step late.

They hadn’t possibly expected that Roan had passed through the borders already.

“I had thought that, perhaps, the Charity Trust’s porter called Henry may be Baron Tale……sir.”

Of course, that was only Pichio’s thought.

Because the harassment from the guards including the gate captain Dosen worsened since about three months ago, he couldn’t dare bring up a such story.

‘Most of all, we couldn’t even see Charity Trust after that……’

Charity Trust, after that day, was using the border gate in the Tale Barony instead of Lancephil County’s border gate.

“Have you perhaps came to cut off my head?”

Silencing through murder.

What came mind at the moment was about that much.

But.

‘I don’t feel nervous.’

His feelings at the moment didn’t held such dreadful sensation.

Roan looked at Pichio’s complicated expression and deeply lowered his head.

“Mister Pichio. I must really apologize.”

“Eh? Wha, what is……”

Even Pichio hadn’t predicted such a sight.

To think a foreign kingdom’s noble, and especially the Crimson Ghost Roan himself, would lower his head at him.

‘And apologizing for some unknown reason too……’

The inside of his head became tangled.

With a soft voice, Roan explained the goal of his visit.

“In truth, after mister Pichio suspected my identity……”

He fully revealed how he got a big interest in Pichio’s ability and talent and used unreasonable schemes to take him.

“It was like that. Dose and the guards harassing and tormenting mister Pichio were all because of what I’ve done. It isn’t because of mister Pichio’s fault.”

“Hmm.”

Pichio exhaled a quiet groan along with a long sigh.

In fact, he did feel an uneasy feeling from Dose and the guards’ actions.

But.

‘They weren’t very kind people before that either……’

The harassment was there even before, and only the intensity had became a little stronger.

They thought unpleasant of Pichio’s sharp instinct.

A discontent person all wrapped up with suspicion.

In the eyes of Dose and the guards, Pichio was only that much of a person.

“I’m really sorry.”

Roan lowered his head once again.

“Did you perhaps even crossed the border just to make that apology?”

Pichio was amazed.

Because he hadn’t ever received such treatment before, it may have been even more amazing.

Roan nodded his head.

It was a situation where one man’s life could had been destroyed due to his greed.

‘I cannot pluck off a flower that hasn’t even bloomed.’

To Pichio, who had endlessly fallen and became dispirited, he wanted to tell him the truth that there was no fault to him.

“You’re an amazing person in many ways.”

Pichio was genuinely amazed.

He lowered his head deeply.

“Thank you for honestly telling me.”

“Will you forgive me?”

Pichio cheerily smiled at Roan’s words and answered.

“There really isn’t anything to forgive or not. My relationships weren’t very good in the first place.”

His voice and smile were mixed with self-deprecation.

Roan quietly stared into Pichio’s eyes, then spoke up in a careful voice.

“It’s truly shameless to say this after making the situation like this, but……”

He planned to tell him the second goal of his visit.

The second reason why Roan went out of his way to cross the border, meet a foreigner, and apologize.

“Would you like to go with me?”

Pichio was that much of a desirable talent.

‘Hph!’

Suddenly, Pichio slightly trembled as if hit by a lightning.

His head and heart electrically numb.

Within his life until now, there were several times he felt like this.

‘When I was going to dig mountain herbs when I was young, when I almost died in the battlefield……’

At the time, he felt an electrifying sensation as if hit by a lightning and an ominous feeling.

Because of the monstrously fearful and horrifying feeling, he ultimately gave up on going to dig mountain herbs, and moved to a different battlefield than where he was originally going to.

‘Later, I heard that the people who went to dig the herbs met a tiger and became a tragedy. And in the battlefield I was originally going to go, the enemy troops were hiding in ambush.’

It was an arousal of a strong instinct that happened very seldomly.

It wasn’t something that was hazily felt, but a strong instinct that would shake his entire mind.

‘Thanks to that, I could save my life. But……’

Even though it wasn’t a situation where life came and went, an electrifying feeling as if being hit by a lightning, just like at those times, wrapped through his entire body.

Of course, there was one thing different than back then.

‘What’s this amazing happiness?’

Instead of unease and fear, happiness and expectations wrapped around him.

His heart beated rapidly and the blood raced quickly.

His face became brightly blushed and his ears became numb.

It was a feeling elated enough to shout out in joy.

‘This is……’

There wasn’t any need to forcibly try to understand why he felt like that.

Since the arousal of strong instinct was something that happened regardless of his will.

Pichio inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘So it’s telling me to go with him.’

He quietly stared at Roan’s eyes.

They were clear eyes without a hint of lie.

‘So there’s someone who sees me like this too.’

A different feeling of satisfaction and pride, unlike the happiness that wrapped his body, arose.

Slowly, Pichio nodded his head.

“I will follow Sir Baron Tale.”

“Ah……”

With a quiet exclamation, Roan grabbed Pichio’s two hands.

Although his instinct wasn’t as great as Pichio, he was certain of at least one thing.

‘He is someone who will become a big influence to me.’

His thoughts weren’t wrong.

In the later days, Pichio would cause a great influence to Baron Tale’s house in many ways.

Although, whether they are good influences or not was something that needed to be watched.

*****

“Hmm. It seems there isn’t a need for me to step up.”

Clay looked at a small butterfly sitting on top of his finger and faintly smiled.

‘A sixth sense. It’s only embellished and called a sixth sense, and is merely an instinct. A man who judges and moves using not his head but his instinct……’

He was a significantly interesting existence.

A man who stood on the opposite end to himself, who judges everything logically.

‘Anyhow, since the lord has resolved it well, I should throw away the plan I separately prepared.’

Clay lightly swung his finger.

Suddenly, the office’s door slightly opened and a cat showed up.

“Come here.”

Clay brushed the cat’s head as he murmured unintelligible words.

It was a druid’s spell.

“There is no need to spread the rumor that Pichio is secretly working with the Rinse Kingdom. All return to the fief.”

At the end of the spell, the message he intended to send was attached.

Originally, he had prepared a backup plan of his own in case Roan failed.

He had planned to create a situation where Pichio could only leave the Istel Kingdom and come to the Rinse Kingdom.

Clay lightly tapped the cat’s back.

Meow.

The cat lowered his head once, then soon went out of the office.

Clay faintly smiled as he watched that sight.

‘My lord. Although the work this time was resolved rather well, being so soft can instead increase the work.’

The smile hanging on his mouth became much thicker.

‘Someday, you will realize that my method is correct.’

His expression was confident.

Although he had stepped back from the matter with Pichio due to Roan’s order, he didn’t think that his method was wrong even so.

‘Now, now the next is……’

Clay closed his eyes and smiled.

He was already planning the next, no, a different work.

*****

“Isn’t it much too good than what we thought?”

“It’s good. It’s really good. We were living in a dilapidated building leaking with rain just a few months ago, but now we got a shiny guild building and each of us got a house.”

“Not only that, even the support fund is seriously full.”

“Thanks to that, the number of mercenaries in our guild is increasing quickly.”

Wild looking young men conversed in quiet voices that didn’t fit them.

A bald middle-aged man sitting at the head of the table frowned as watched that sight.

‘It’s dangerous.’

With a large fist, he slammed down on the table.

Boom.

Instantly, the ones chatting this and that all closed their mouths.

With startled faces, they looked at the bald middle-aged man.

“Master. You surprised me.”

“Why would you slam the table so suddenly?”

Complaints flowed out.

The bald middle-aged man, Powell, the one who was called the master of the guild, answered with a greatly twisted face.

“It looks like you bastards have lost your minds for a moment since your backs are warm and your stomachs full, so what was the reason we moved the guild’s base to the Tale Barony?”

“Khm.”

At those words, awkward coughs came out from here and there.

With absolutely furious light in his eyes, Powell continued his words.

“Listen clearly. We infiltrated the Tale Barony upon Sir Count Jonathan Chase’s order. Infiltrated. When Sir Count Chase’s order comes later, we have to put our lives on the line and fight Baron Tale’s house. Understand?”

The moment his words finished, the mercenaries smacked their lips and nodded their heads.

“We know.”

“We know that. Who forgot it?”

“I’ve engraved that in my mind every day.”

Although their words were like that, bitter looks were plain on one side of their faces.

That was also the same for Powell who shouted.

‘How did we, the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild, get like this……’

At one time, they were an enormous mercenary guild that ruled the battlefields while receiving chunks of money.

But now, they were receiving orders from a ambition-tainted noble and playing spies.

‘If we can just finish this work well, we can raise the guild once more.’

They won’t have to do dirty works like this anymore.

But paradoxically, the guild was already prospering much more than before.

Roan and the Baron Tale’s house’s sponsorship was that great.

‘Damn it. If it wasn’t for this work, it would have become quite a nice relationship, but……’

His mouth pointlessly felt bitter.

To throw away the distracting thoughts within his head, Powell took out a different topic.

“Come to think of it, we need to pick new managers, right?”

“Yes. Because the number of mercenaries and mercenary guilds that joined have greatly increased, we need to pick about five new guys.”

Powell nodded at those words and asked their opinions.

“Is there someone good?”

As soon as he spoke those words, all the mercenaries spat out a word.

“If it’s someone good, it’s Griffith and Moffett.”

“I’ll recognize Griffith, but Bauls is better than Moffett.”

“Agree with Griffith. And I like Kwoles with that.”

“Kwoles is good. And Sweeney and Coleman there are good too. Of course, Griffith is the best.”

Powell, who had been listening, quietly nodded his head.

It wasn’t as if there wasn’t anyone.

“Good. For now, make a list of suitable people. After that, we’ll pick the new managers based on the current managers’ recommendations.”

“Yes. Understood.”

All of them answered in one voice.

They were bright and energetic answers as if a bright future had spread in front of their eyes.

But they did not know.

Of the truth that a shadow had been thickly casted within the guild.

*****

A secret room.

Several small candles were barely pushing away the heavy darkness.

“For now, it’s going as planned.”

“Yes. in the list of new manager nominees, five people have put up their names. Of course, Lepis, no, Griffith is the most likely candidate amongst them.”

At the report that continued on, a young man nodded his head with a satisfied expression.

He was in fact Keep of the Tenebra Troop, Baron Tale’s House’s intelligence agency.

“For now, tell them to continue and earn the trust of the guild master and the managers.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The young trooper hid into the dark as he answered.

Keep looked down at the documents spread out on top of the desk, and slightly creased his brows.

‘Certainly, multiple suspicious circumstances are being discovered.’

But the situation was still not enough.

They had to find more definite evidence.

‘The infiltrating troopers, including Griffith, need to do well.’

With a short sigh, Keep closed his eyes.

Countless intelligence missions that were happening all over the kingdom filled his head.

Currently, he was one of the most busy retainers in Baron Tale’s house.

*****

Winter had ended.

It was already the second month since Spring had came.

Pichio, who had became a Baron Tale House’s retainer three months ago, gazed at the Mediasis Castle that developed remarkably every day and smiled.

‘A broad street extending straight from north to south and the small roads that are interconnected. And even houses and shops placed in an orderly manner. Mediasis Castle is truly an excellent castle.’

Especially the castle wall, which was just finished three days ago, showed off an incredible splendor that seemed like it will never allow an invasion of monsters and enemies.

At that moment.

Vvuuuuuu!

A sound of horn was heard from the north gate’s side.

However, there was no one who panicked.

‘It seems Sir Count Io Lancephil and Sir Baron Aaron Tate have arrived.’

Once Winter had passed and the Tale Barony had more or less settled, the two, whose relationship with Roan was close, had visited the fief.

Through multiple announcements, Roan had already notified the Mediasis Castle’s residents of this fact.

Thanks to that, the castle’s citizens didn’t panic and were passing a peaceful day like usual.

‘I should soon go down as well.’

Pichio’s current rank was the captain of the Mediasis Guard who oversaw the Mediasis Castle’s public order.

His steps, coming from the watch tower that rose high down to the street, were very light and confident.

On his face, even a bright smile had arose.

‘If the meeting this time goes well……’

Because he knew what the next thing that would happen after that is.

The smile became much thicker.

Now, the Baron Tale House was about to start a great wing stroke towards its first goal.

Tale Barony (7) End.

Chapter 153




T/n (CSV): Regular Chapter for Thursday. Sorry about the lateness.

Would it feel like this if one’s son succeeded?

Looking at the buildings that lined the sides of the far extending broad street and the happy faces of people, Count Io Lancephil couldn’t hide a proud expression.

‘It’s more brilliant than the Pavor Castle.’

The Pavor Castle, the center of the Lancephil County and where the lord’s castle was located in, was a brilliant castle that was considered to be the best even in the Rinse Kingdom’s Northeast. 1

Although the Mediasis Castle had achieved many developments within a short amount of time, it wasn’t at a level where it could dare to compare itself to the Pavor Castle.

It merely looked like so in Io’s eyes.

‘It’s a clean and beautiful city.’

His heart felt truly proud and accomplished.

‘The spearman who seemed like a child has already became a lord of a fief.’

Io, who was looking around himself with a proud gaze, met eyes with Baron Aaron Tate, who was next to him.

Smiling widely, Aaron nodded his head.

He too, as much as Io, felt greatly surprised and proud.

‘I definitely knew that he will become big.’

The day Roan raised a big achievement in the Battle of Pedian Plain and held the merits awards.

He had already felt it at that time.

‘That he would become our Rinse Kingdom’s future.’

Because of that, he had wished to tie his daughter Mary Tate to him.

But.

‘Mary already has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend also is a young man not below Roan. Just that……’

There was something that weighed upon his mind.

Aaron furtively turned his head and looked at Kali Owells, who was following behind Io.

‘The boyfriend’s father is Kali Owells……’

Status, house, wealth, power, one’s own abilities.

There was not a single thing that was lacking of Kali.

Rather, the truth was that Aaron was lacking.

But despite so, Aaron found Kali unpleasant.

‘It feels as if he is concealing a sword within himself.’

A snake kept coming up to his mind when he looked at him.

‘I’m probably thinking too much.’

Aaron forcibly shook his head and looked forwards again.

“Ah……”

Suddenly, a quiet exclamation flew out.

At the end of the broad street.

In front of the inner castle that surrounded the lord’s castle, stood the young man he wished to see so much.

Roan Tale.

Wearing a clean and simple suit and accompanied by the chief retainers, Roan was standing still and looking at Io and Aaron.

“He got bigger.”

Io quietly murmured.

Aaron, who was next to him, nodded his head and agreed.

“Yes. He has become a big man.”

It wasn’t merely talking about his stature.

The two people, with proud expressions, went down from their horses.

And as if it had been waiting, a grand music exploded out from the sides of the street.

Ppabababam! Ppabam! Ppababam!

Sounds that hit not the ears but the chest.

It was the performance of the Milta military band that Roan made to boost Tale Legion’s morals.

The performance continued until Io and Aaron arrived in front of Roan.

Chaeng!

A clear metallic sound noted the end of the music.

Roan, as if he had been waiting, saluted.

Chk!

As if they had all practiced, the Baron Tale House’s retainers all bowed their heads.

It was a courteous and polite attitude.

But the air that definitely exuded from them was so great, several scholar retainers of Io and Aaron unconsciously flinched.

“It has been a while. Sir Count Lancephil, Sir Baron Tate.”

Roan brightly smiled and looked at Io and Aaron’s eyes.

Io and Aaron took a step forwards and clasped Roan’s hands.

“Yes. Have you been well?”

“You’ve became a man already.”

As if greeting a son, the lights in the two people’s eyes were warm and gentle.

At the passionate feelings felt through the clasped hands and the eyes, Roan merely smiled.

He too couldn’t suppress the feelings that climbed up.

“For now, do please come in. The banquet has been prepared.”

At those words, Io and Aaron faintly smiled and complained.

“Even a banquet……”

“There really wasn’t any need to prepare like that.”

Smiling brightly, Roan led the two people and walked into the inner castle.

The mood inside of the inner castle was also different than the outside.

Since it was the place where the legion’s headquarter and its branches were gathered, firstly, the buildings were tall and large.

On the streets, officials wearing slightly red-tinted suits were busily moving about.

“Tale fief probably is the busiest place in our kingdom.”

“It’s also the place that’s growing the fastest.”

With amazed looks, Io and Aaron praised on once more.

Roan shyly smiled and hurried his steps.

A clean and neat lord’s castle that had just been raised up to a second story, appeared.

In front of the door of the lord’s castle, the Mediasis Guards, led by Pichio, were lined up.

Pichio, who had been guarding the gate, stepped to the side and pushed the scabbard at his waist in front of his knees.

And as if they had been waiting, the guards lining on two sides all pushed their scabbards at once.

Chk!

With a movement overflowing with vigor, a heavy sound echoed out.

It was the guards’ own style of welcoming ceremony.

“Oh……”

At the vigor that pricked and electrified their skin, Io and Aaron let out quiet exclamations.

Simultaneously, Pichio saluted towards Roan.

Roan slightly nodded his head and then stepped into the lord’s castle.

Gulp.

The Count Lancephil House’s retainers and the Baron Tate House’s retainers, who were following behind Io and Aaron, unconsciously gulped.

Each and every single movement of the guards exuded with etiquette and dignity.

In the end, Kali Owells slightly frowned.

‘It has became much more bothersome than I thought.’

The Tale fief had developed much more than he had thought.

‘I should take care of this side too before I carry out the plan.’

It was certain that it will become a big obstacle to the revolt he prepared.

Ddk.

His teeth gritted.

In Kali’s position, Roan was a stone that rolled in. 2

And a very distasteful one at that.

But that stone was trying to push him, the stone that was stuck, away.

‘Roan Tale……’

A cold gaze stabbed into Roan’s back.

‘I will definitely make you kneel below my knees.’

A vain dream flowed through his chest and up into his head.

Consequently, the head that was clear became blurred.

*****

[Uah. These misters are amazing!]

Kinis fussed about.

Currently, she was sitting on top of Roan’s head and was staring at Io and Aaron.

“Hahaha! The wine tastes unusually good today.”

“You are right, sir. I think I could drink it all night.”

The two people heartily laughed and tirelessly tilted their wine cups.

That was no wonder, as the Baron Tale House’s retainers were taking turns pouring them a cup.

“I’m Chris, the one managing the Tale Barony’s Agens.”

“I am called Clay, the one in charge of the Tale Barony’s administration and the Bureau of Druids.”

“I’m Keep of the Tale Barony’s Tale Legion.”

The core retainers took turns introducing themselves.

Each time, Io and Aaron didn’t refuse and received a cup.

[They’re drinking wine as if it’s water.]

Kinis once again shook her head in awe.

Although Roan’s limit was also at quite a level, they were at a level he simply couldn’t follow.

“Kinis.”

[Ah, sure.]

When he whispered in a quiet voice, Kinis answered shortly and then waved her hand.

Paat.

Instantly, a short wave trembled in Roan’s cup.

“Roan. You drink as well.”

Coincidently, Io offered a drink.

Roan raised and showed the cup he was holding, and drank it all it in one breath.

The strong liquor had already turned into clear water.

‘I never knew Kinis would become a help like this.’

A smile hung on his mouth.

But Io and Aaron’s limits were much greater than his expectations.

The two people’s drinking showed an end only after most of the retainers that participated had fallen.

“Should we stop at this much for today?”

“Since there is still a several days’ worth of time.”

At those words, Kinis became appalled.

[These misters aren’t human.]

Roan slightly nodded his head and agreed to those words.

At that moment.

“Roan. I’m truly thankful to you for recommending me to be the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander. It was something I haven’t even thought of.”

Aaron faintly smiled and thanked him once again.

Roan shook his head.

“No. I had simply recommended the most fitting person.”

It was true.

He hadn’t recommended him to the position of the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander simply because of the Brent’s Ring.

Aaron, who he had watched from the side, had the ability and character that could adequately shoulder the heavy responsibilities.

“But even though you could had received a big award for suppressing the rebellion……”

Aaron left off his words with an expression that said sorry.

The recommendation of the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander was something that happened in the merits ceremony that was done after suppressing Baron Elton Coat’s rebellion.

If it wasn’t for that, Roan could had received a significantly great award.

Aaron lingeringly felt sorry for that.

Roan quickly shook his head.

“I also received a big award at that place. The king had said that he would give that wide lake to me if I could just subjugate the Poskein Lake.”

“Ah……”

Io and Aaron leaked out quiet exclamations.

Come to think of it, they had completely forgot about that matter.

Io slightly creased his forehead and asked.

“Do you really plan to subjugate the Poskein Lake?”

“Yes. I plan to do so.”

Roan answered with a determined look.

Io and Aaron quietly nodded their heads.

‘Since Roan isn’t a guy who does something useless.’

There certainly must be a rational reason.

“Then you are currently preparing for the subjugation?”

When Aaron asked, Roan faintly smiled as he replied.

“The preparation is already at the final stage.”

“Then you will soon go out on the subjugation.”

With a bitter smile, Roan shook his head.

“That too isn’t like that.”

Io, who had been listening, cautiously asked.

“Is there some sort of problem?”

Roan slightly nodded his head.

“To subjugate the Poskein Lake, I have to transfer in most of the Tale Legion’s entire strength. But if that happens, the defense of the border region with the Istel Kingdom will become weak and there won’t be any way to defend even if monsters become active within the fief.”

“Hmm.”

Io and Aaron quietly groaned.

In short, he was worrying of making a gap in strength.

‘Is he planning to wait for now until the legion’s size becomes a bit bigger?’

Although that was the proper step, the time was too precious to do that.

Currently, the Rinse Kingdom was maintaining a precarious state of peace both domestically and internationally.

The three princes’ tug of war internally, and the tug of war between the adjacent kingdoms externally were weirdly balancing themselves.

If he planned to subjugate the Poskein Lake, right now was the perfect time.

For a moment, the silence continued.

Then.

“Since I received a big debt from you, I can not sit still.”

Aaron cheerfully smiled and spoke up.

“I will allocate the 7th corp of the Eastern Regional Corps near Tale Barony’s border. With even that much reinforcement, the Istel Kingdom’s army won’t have any strange thoughts.”

In the first place, the Istel Kingdom wasn’t in a situation where it could start a large scale invasion or battle.

When Aaron offered a hearty offer, Io, who had been listening, suddenly chimed in.

“Then I will support the fief regiment. If monsters possibly become active in the Tale Barony, I’ll subjugate them with our fief’s troops.”

“Sir Count, Sir baron.”

Roan stared at them with a slightly startled expression.

In truth, the two people’s offers were something Roan had wished to separately request.

But since Io and Aaron spoke up first, Roan simply felt grateful and thankful.

Roan stood up from his seat and bowed from his waist.

“Truly, thank you very much.”

Io and Aaron waved their hands at those words.

“There’s really no need for thanks……”

“Just go and fabulously subjugate the Poskein Lake. Go and snap right off the noses of those bastards laughing at you.”

Their voices and expressions overflowed with sincerity.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“I will definitely answer your expectations.”

As soon as his words finished, Io and Aaron looked at each other, then raised their wine cups as if they couldn’t hold it in.

“However I look at it, it’s too regrettable to end it like this.”

“Let’s drink a bit more.”

The two people quickly emptied their cups and offered wine even to Roan.

From above his head, he heard Kinis’ voice.

[These two misters really aren’t human.]

*****

“Isn’t this really too much? For our fief regiment to take on even the Tale Barony’s defense. I have to tell him that I just can’t do it, I just can’t.”

The captain of the Lancephil Fief Regiment, Perry Wilson burst out in rage.

But at the sound of Kali Owells clicking his tongue, he could only close his mouth.

“Tch Tch Tch. Why are your thoughts so shortsighted?”

“Yes?”

With a puzzled expression, Perry cautiously asked back.

Making a frightening smile, Kali answered.

“I too don’t like the Sir Count’s actions. But the current situation itself is very favorable to us.”

Even without that, he was about to make a move on the Tale fief’s side in preparation for the revolt.

But at the very perfect moment, a perfect situation had unfolded.

“If the Tale Legion’s entire strength heads towards the Poskein Lake, wouldn’t it become much easier when we are carrying out our work?”

“Ah……”

Perry exploded out a quiet exclamation.

He hadn’t quite thought up to that part.

Still making a chilling smile, Kali nodded his head.

“We should send someone to Sir Count Chase. That a perfect time to start the work has come.”

Gulp.

Tyrone Bess and Perry Wilson gulped.

Although they did first planned the work together, they instinctively became tense when the start came up in front of their nose.

Watching that sight, Kali faintly smiled.

“There is no need be so nervous. Because this work……”

The smile became even thicker.

“Will definitely succeed.”

*****

Io and Aaron stayed about ten more days in the Tale fief.

Following Roan’s guide, they toured many of the fief’s locations and shared many stories.

Roan had, word for word, given them a passionate reception.

To him, the two people weren’t simply acquaintances but no different a family.

That was also the same for Io and Aaron.

Only on the day the two people had to leave came did they open the bag of presents they had prepared.

It was an incredible amount of treasure that seemed almost unreasonable.

When Roan refused with a startled expression, Io and Aaron led their retainers and quickly left.

With Roan’s refusal in mind from the start, they had pushed the present bag at the very last day.

Seeing off the two people who left, Roan couldn’t move for a long time.

His heart felt void and empty.

But he couldn’t stay like that forever.

He had works that he must do.

As soon as he returned to the lord’s castle, Roan gathered the retainers.

Not in the meeting room they usually gathered but in a large and grand hall, the administrators and the commanders gathered one after another.

“What could it be?”

“It looks like most of the officials have all gathered.”

“Even the thousand-man commanders are all participating.”

An assembly of such a great scale was a first.

At that moment, the door that had been tightly closed opened fully and Roan showed up.

Behind him, the Three-thousand-man commanders Austin and Semi, Agens’ president Chris, the head administrator Clay, Tenebra Troop’s Keep, and so on showed up one after another.

The officials, who were spread out and chatting, all straightened and lined up, and bowed.

Roan walked boldly in between the officials who took their places on both sides.

Walking up onto the head seat a step higher than the floor, he glanced through each retainers.

A confident and gentle air flowed out from the light in his eyes.

“In the last Winter, our Tale Barony has achieved a shocking amount of development.”

His voice was composed.

“With the Mediasis Castle at the center, we have raised fortresses in key locations in the four directions and organized the roads all the way to the fief’s border. We have found various branches such as Agens, Tenebra, Tale Alchemy Department, Tale Engineering Department, Tale Navy, and Bureau of Druids, and built multiple human resource development institutions such as the Mediasis Academy and Tale Training camp. Here, the Tale Commerce Division, made up of Lidia Lumber Co. and Eska Restaurant, Ford Mining Co., and Charity Trust, has achieved a dramatic growth. Not only that, the Sale Company’s Transportation Division is scheduled to be created soon.”

In short, not only the economy and the military, the entire social infrastructure had achieved a uniform growth.

Roan tightly clenched his fist.

“We will make this powerfully hardened basis as our foundation and charge towards the first goal.”

Strength went into his voice.

“Austin!”

It was a voice that made anyone’s heart race.

Austin, who was vowing amongst the officials, stepped forwards and saluted.

“Vassal Austin present.”

A deep voice echoed through the great hall.

Roan powerfully extended his right hand.

“You will lead the Piedes Troop and march to the Nuperu village first. Deliver the tools made by the Tale Engineering Department and the Reno Magic Tower to the Tale Navy.”

“Yes sir! I will carry out the order, sir!”

Austin deeply lowered his head once and stepped back.

“Semi!”

Soon following that, Semi stepped forwards and saluted.

“Vassal Semi present.”

“You too lead the Impasse Troop and march to the Nuperu Village. Collaborate with the Tale Navy and build a camp that the entire legion can stay in the village’s southeastern plain.”

“Yes sir! I will carry out the order, sir!”

When Semi stepped back together with his answer, Roan looked at Clay.

“Clay!”

“Yes. Head Administrator Clay present.”

Clay answered with a soft voice and bowed.

“You will make sure that there is no negligence in the ration and supply preparation.”

“Yes. I will carry out the order.”

Clay answered with a confident face.

Roan slightly nodded his head.

Besides other points, he too recognized Clay’s talent at least.

Following behind, multiple orders were given to each branches and troops.

The mood in the great hall heated up fiercely.

‘What? Just what is it……’

‘It’s an incredible marching preparation……’

Few minor officials, unable to understand the situation that was turning, could only gulp.

Soon, with the Mediasis Guard Captain Pichio as the last, the issuing of the orders ended.

Roan calmed his breath and glanced deeply through the officials within the great hall.

A burning heat wrapped around his body.

[What’s this, my body is heating up for some reason?]

Kinis fussed about.

She too had felt the pressure that Baron Tale House’s retainers exuded through their entire body.

Roan tightly clenched his fist.

“From now, we will……”

His voice was hot as the heat.

Gulp.

Everyone gulped and waited for his next words.

The heat became fiercer.

Roan deeply inhaled.

“Subjugate the Poskein Lake.”

The order had finally fallen.

Every retainer, including Austin and Semi, kneeled down on one knee and lowered their head.

“We shall carry out the order, sir!”

Resounding voices shook the great hall.

That day, the advanced party of six thousand, led by Austin and Semi, marched through the south gate.

Roan went up all the way to the ramparts and watched that sight.

At the awe-inspiring sight, his heart felt proud naturally.

‘This year too……’

A faint smile hung on his mouth.

‘Will be mindlessly busy.’

Coincidently, a warm south wind blew.

That was the spring wind that signaled the start of a year, no, a new leap.

Poskein Subjugation End.

Chapter 154




T/n (CSV): A late regular release for last Sunday. Sorry. For those not familiar with parts of a ship, reference this terminology of parts of Ship

At a watchtower above a fortress.

A man was watching the sight of Roan leading the army in march.

He was Chris, a retainer of Roan and the president of Agens.

When the other retainers were each receiving major and important missions, he too separately received a crucial mission.

“Since the lord has moved, raise the surveillance system on that man to the highest level. Transfer in all the agents of Agens and the spy animals we received from the Bureau of Druids.”

“But sir, if we do that, the intelligence line from other sides will all stop.”

Pens spoke with a worried look.

However, Chris was determined.

“The important thing right now is monitoring him. After this point in time, do not miss a single cough from him.”

“Hmm. Yes. Understood.”

Pens couldn’t ask anymore and lowered his head.

However, he couldn’t hide just one point of doubt.

“But will he really move?”

“If there is something, he will definitely move. Because……”

Chris paused for a moment.

Gulping back a dry throat, Pens stared at Chris’ face.

“Right now is the best opportunity.”

This wasn’t only Chris’ thought.

It was also the thought of Roan and Clay, who had built this plan.

“Hmm.”

Pens wordless nodded his head.

The two people, until the precession of the legion couldn’t be seen, stood still at that place.

Like that, the time flowed on.

*****

The news of the Tale Barony reached the capital, Miller, about ten days later.

The information delivery system was still inadequate.

At first, they showed guarded looks at the movement of a large scale legion, but once they learned that the goal was the subjugation of the Poskein Lake, they instead laughed loudly at them and showed no particular interest.

Like that, most of the people thought that Poskein Lake Subjugation was a foolish and meaningless war.

“We have finally caught his tail!”

The Agens director’s office’s door abruptly opened and Pens appeared.

Chirs, who was trapped under an incredible pile of documents, abruptly stood up.

“As expected, he moved as we thought.”

“Yes. It is as the lord and director Clay’s expectations.”

Faintly smiling, Pens passed the paper he was holding.

Chris, as he read the content written on the paper, creased his brows.

“So it wasn’t Duke Bradley Webster but Count Jonathan Chase.”

“Yes. Because of that, it seems that there was a confusion even between the agents.”

Chris nodded his head at Pens’ answer.

“Good. Continue to carry out the monitoring on him.”

“Understood.”

Pens, along with the answer, jumped out of the director’s office.

It was a situation where even a single moment was precious.

There wasn’t the leisure to delay even a bit.

‘Kali Owells. You bastard has bit down on the bait.’

Originally, Agens was monitoring Kali’s surroundings on Roan’s order.

But due to numerous battles that had continued since the Poskein Exodus, they couldn’t fully use their intelligence power.

Due to that, although they did notice that Kali was showing disturbing movements to a certain degree, they hadn’t had a clear grasp of the situation.

‘Furthermore, because the first place Kali lined up was to Duke Bradley Webster.’

Even before Io presented the Tale Region to Roan, Kali was constantly sending bribes to Duke Bradley Webster.

Thanks to that, there was a confusion in the Agens agents’ information collection and analysis.

Within such situation, Roan and Clay made up a single trick.

That was the Poskein Lake Subjugation.

In the Poskein Lake Subjugation, there were two goals.

One was to literally subjugate the Poskein Lake.

And the other one was to make Kali’s scheme rise up to the surface.

They had predicted that he would definitely show some kind of movement if the surrounding situation changed.

Their prediction hit the mark.

Possibly thinking of the Tale Legion’s Poskein Lake Subjugation as the best opportunity, Kali moved rapidly and noisily unlike before.

Agens didn’t miss this chance.

Furthermore, the Agens of now even possessed many spy animals received from the Bureau of Druids.

‘In the end, we found out that the man Kali was lining behind was Count Jonathan Chase. Furthermore, the fact that he has already seized most of the county’s military too……’

To a point of wondering how the things had progressed to this state, Kali’s hands were already spread throughout the entire County.

However, this wasn’t Chris’ nor Agens’ fault.

The kingdom was too wide.

Furthermore, Roan had experienced too many things within a short amount of time.

Agens, which had just been born, grasping everything was close to impossible.

Also.

‘Since the most important person to us isn’t Sir Count Lancephil but our lord.’

Io was pushed down in the order of priority.

At least, if the help of Bureau of Druids wasn’t there, they would have missed it.

Chris quickly prepared the report and then took out a messenger bird. 1

Pdududuk!

The messenger bird tilted its head left and right, then soon flew out the window with a strong flap of its wings.

On its leg, a small tube containing the report was attached.

Chris looked at the southern sky and inhaled deeply.

‘My lord. It seems a red season will start once again.’

A season of blood.

The time of war was coming back.

*****

“It’s enormous.”

Brian, who was wearing heavy armor, shook his head as he looked at the fleet that completely filled the entire lakeside.

Although there already was a time they used the Tale Navy’s fleet back during the Baron Elton Coat’s rebellion, it felt like the size had increased much more than back then.

Roan, who was next to him, proudly smiled and nodded his head.

“Daiv has done well.”

Honestly, it was above his expectation.

Tale Navy’s warships, which were much harder and faster than regular sailboats, hung triangle sails and were able to sail easily even in headwinds and reach a fairly fast speed.

On top of that, the sharp iron spikes attached not only on the stem and the stern as well as all around the ship impeded the approach of underwater monsters. 2

Besides that, they had also meticulously analyzed the Poskein Lake’s topography and the monsters and made various preparations.

Furthermore, the ones who had made such preparations weren’t only the Tale Navy.

The Alchemy Department, the Engineering Department, and the Reno Magic Tower had collaborated and created two magic tools, and these were objects that could be described as so-called wonders.

‘If there was time, we could have made more plenty of them, but……’

Currently, they could only load only one per ship at most.

Of course, making at least that many was a great result too.

“Brian.”

Roan organized the distracting thoughts, and looked at Brian.

“Yes, sir.”

Brian slightly lowered his head as he answered.

“You will lead the heavy armor troop Vende and two thousand-man troops, and……”

For a while, a furtive instruction continued.

“Yes sir. I will carry out the instructions.”

Brian quickly saluted and then immediately moved his feet.

Although the heavy armor clashed loudly and made clanging sounds, his movements at least were very quick.

Roan did not look at him any longer.

It was because a shout he had been waiting for had came from the lakeside’s fleet.

“We have finished boarding everyone, sir!”

At Austin’s shout, Roan slowly moved his steps.

He climbed up onto the largest ship amongst the fleet.

Daiv saluted and lowered his head.

At the end of the mast, the legion’s flag and the general’s flag symbolizing Roan were hung.

The flags, at the west wind that blew timely, fluttered powerfully.

Roan Tale.

Tale Legion.

Amaranth Troop.

The elegant crests and the majestic writings showed off their splendor.

“Please give the order to set sail.”

At Daiv’s words, Roan climbed up onto the ship’s forecastle and drew out the Travias Spear. 3

Chang!

When he inserted mana, the spear, which had been about the length of a forearm, extended and soared.

The black handle of the spear took the light and flashed.

Roan, as he felt the hundreds, thousands of pairs of gazes pouring down on him, shouted aloud.

“Sail!”

The moment the order fell, the sound of horn followed.

Vvuuuuu!

At the same time, the gigantic ships began to softly move with sounds of wood twisting.

Ggiiiig.

With the flagship carrying Roan at the lead, the Tale Navy’s fleet moved in perfect order.

Their goal was the Poskein Lake’s subjugation, and their destination was the Exos Island, which they planned to use as a military port.

The remaining time.

‘There isn’t much time.’

Roan gritted his teeth.

The Agens’ report he received right after marching off filled his head.

Although it was something he had expected, he couldn’t help but be annoyed.

‘Kali Owells. You probably think that the things are flowing as you wish.’

In reality, he was merely caught in the trap Roan had set.

‘But it is true that the situation is more difficult than I thought.’

He had tried to perfectly snare and bring him out, but the situation was poor.

‘I’ll have to give the flesh and save the bones.’

The world was still much too great an existence to move according to his will.

*****

Ggiaaaag!

A monstrous scream hit the ears.

The light armors made for above water battles were already drenched wet.

Piercing through the faintly fallen dark, an amazing number of monsters crawled up the ships.

“Block them! Stab with the spears!”

“Arrows! Fire the arrows!”

The ten-man commanders, the hundred-man commanders, and the thousand-man commanders’ voices echoed noisily.

“Uwaaaah!”

“Die!”

The soldiers, along with roars, swung their knives, spears, axes, and swords.

Each time, the monsters sprayed blood and died.

“The port side deck is being pierced!” 4

“The port! The port!”

Frantic voices rang out.

When the soldiers on the deck were moving to port a moment late.

Paat!

One man, with a sound of wind, landed on the center of the portside deck.

Simultaneously.

Pabababat!

Sharp sounds of impacts hit the ears.

A black spear rapidly spun and massacred the monsters that had climbed onto the ships.

“Ah! Lord!”

“Lord!”

The soldiers who had ran up a moment late shouted with exhilarated expressions.

The very man who was freely running through the port side deck as he split the monsters into halves was Roan Tale.

Ssskuk!

The spear’s blade soared diagonally and cut through a monster’s entire body.

Roan directly climbed up onto the edge of the deck and raised his spear up high.

“Taemusa!” 5

A resonant voice echoed through the battlefield.

Suddenly.

“Sir! Taemusa at ready!”

An aura that electrified and rang through the skin exploded out.

On each ship’s center deck, soldiers wearing crimson helmets appeared.

They were the Baron Tale House’s very elite soldiers who had passed the impartial selection test and trained the Tale Mana Technique.

The men who consciously refused the title of knights and desired to be called Taemusa.

Unlike the traditional knights, they wished to fight while mixed together with the soldiers.

Sssuguk!

Roan pierced the head of a monster approaching below his feet, and shouted at the top of his lungs.

“Massacre them!”

A horrifying order fell.

“Yes sir!”

From each ship, resounding voices were heard.

At the same time, the crimson-helmeted Taemusas sprinted to the port and starboard decks.

They, going past the regular soldiers and onto the very front, swung each’s weapons.

The weapons, faintly wrapped in mana, cut through the air.

Ggiaaaag!

The monsters screamed horrifying shrieks as they fell off.

The Taemusa’s skills were still not comparable to traditional knights.

But with just the fact that they had learned a mana technique and the fact they knew how to use mana, they displayed a much greater strength than regular soldiers.

‘With this subjugation, they will grow even further.’

Watching the actions of the Taemusas, Roan gritted his teeth.

At the same time, he kicked off the deck and soar into the air.

The spearhead flashed and shined a light, then cut apart the space along with a sharp sound of impact.

Pbububububuk!

One after another, the monsters’ heads exploded with a horrifying sound.

“Kinis!”

At Roan’s call.

[Over here!]

A sharp and buzzing voice was heard.

Soon, a small column of water soared up below Roan’s feet.

Tat!

Stepping on the column of water with the tip of his feet, Roan soared into the air once again.

To other people’s eyes, it seemed as if he was moving nimbly while stepping on the monsters’ corpses floating on the lake’s surface.

“Are you not tired?”

Roan asked in a quiet voice.

Ever since the battle had begun, Kinis had continuously been using the power of the spirits.

Because Roan’s level of aura of water was low and Kinis’ own growth was in a slowed state, she just may experience an excessive stress.

However, Kinis was overflowing with strength for some reason.

[Nope! Instead, I’m getting more lively when I use my power?]

Her voice also seemed to find it hard to believe.

“Then that’s good!”

Roan widely swung his spear and formed a faint smile.

‘Is it because of piece of Biate somewhere in the lake……’

The reason Kinis was able to display a much stronger power than usual.

It may perhaps be because of the piece holding the essence of water that the queen of water Biate had left as she died.

‘Anyway, now is the time to focus on the battle!’

Throwing away the distracting thoughts, Roan called out to Kinis once more.

“Kinis.”

[Got it!]

With a short answer, Kinis made a solid column of water.

Roan landed lightly on top of it, and then shook his spear in every direction.

Ssskuk! Sssuguk!

Ggiaaaag!

The monsters that swam and jumped through the surface of the water, without offering a single proper resistance, died off.

The Tale Barony wasn’t the only thing that had grown during the winter.

Roan Tale.

He too had achieved an absolutely remarkable growth.

Not only the Flamdor Mana Technique, the spearmanship from real battles, and the Reid art of fighting, the Dion roots and the Flepsse Spearmanship became a great help in Roan’s growth and development.

Pububububuk!

Roan, word for word, massacred the monsters and then lightly jumped onto a ship.

“Throw the iron nets!”

It was one of the tools Daiv had made in preparation for the Poskein Lake Subjugation.

Soon, a rattling metallic sound was heard from the poop deck. 6

Splash! Splash!

With a heavy sound, a great splash of water sprayed out.

Ggiiiik!

With a sound of wood rubbing against each other, the ship’s direction turned slightly to the right.

Sinking under the surface of the water, the tough and strong iron net swooped onto the monsters.

Gkieeeek!

The monsters screamed and tried to escape, but the Daiv’s seamanship was much greater than they thought.

Furthermore, the entire fleet had thrown the iron nets.

The monsters that had energetically attacked were unable to find a place to escape and panicked.

Chrrrrr!

The iron nets, with metallic sounds, wrapped around the monsters.

“Drag them up onto the surface of the water!”

The moment the order was given, two Taemusas grabbed the lever on the poop deck.

Because the height of even just the iron nets was so great, it was impossible to pull them up with ordinary soldiers’ strength.

Daiv too, even after preparing the iron nets, had worried due to this problem.

At that moment, the Reno Magic Tower and the Engineering Department stepped up.

The engineering department created the levers that could pull up the iron nets, and the Reno Magic Tower carved a small-scale power-up magic array so that the levers could work with a little amount of strength.

Sssg! Sssg! Sssg!

Two Taemusas, flowing in mana, turned the lever around in circles.

Suddenly, the iron nets of incredible weight, nets full of monsters at that, rose up above the surface of the water.

Roan, who had been standing at the poop deck, shouted aloud.

“Pour down the arrows!”

It was the order they had been waiting for.

The archers, who had been lined up along the deck, pulled their bow strings without a delay.

Ping! Piing! Pipipiping!

With sharp sounds of impact, tens, hundreds of arrows cut across the air and planted themselves onto the surface of water.

Pububububuk!

The monsters, which were caught in the iron net and couldn’t move a bit, became like porcupines just like that.

Kkeueeg!

The shrieks of dying breaths hit the ears.

The surface of the lake that had been blue was dyed with a red light.

It wasn’t because the sunset had fell in the west sky.

‘This is war.’

Roan forcefully put away emotional thoughts.

Standing on top of the poop deck, he looked at the soldiers.

“Now, the sun will set soon.”

If it was a usual war of humans against humans, it should had been a time to take a rest.

However, the war with the monsters was different.

The real battle began after the sun had set.

After calming his breath, Roan spoke in a quiet but powerful voice.

“Prepare for the night battle.”

At that moment, Kinis’ complaining voice was heard.

[Eei. My skin gets bad if we stay up……]

*****

“So it really is like that……”

Count Io Lancephil spat out a long sigh with a distressed expression.

Even when he had first heard the news, he simply couldn’t believe it.

Merely few days ago, he had spent a joyful time together with countless retainers.

But that had all disappeared as if it was a lie.

It felt as if he had dreamt a round of happy dreams.

“Hohoho.”

A despondent laughter flowed out.

He looked at Eik Lamus, his retainer and the one who took on the big and small works of the county, who was standing next to him.

“Are you saying that the knight order, the fief regiment, and the magic corp’s core commanders are all standing on Kali Owells’ side?”

“It’s not certain because we have looked into it so carefully and secretly, but eight out of ten, they seem to be standing on that side.”

His expression was shamed.

“Hohoho.”

Io let out a dispirited laugh once more.

“I thought that I had treated them well in my own way……”

They were all retainers whom he favored.

However, most of them had betrayed him.

Because it was Io, who was known by the fief’s citizens as virtuous lord and a good natured noble even amongst the nobles, the shock was much greater.

At that moment.

“It probably is due to the enfeoffment problem, sir.” 7

The young man sitting on the opposite side of Io carefully opened his mouth.

He was Roan’s right-hand man and the president of Agens, Chris.

Chris had already left the Mediasis Castle and had entered the Pavor castle.

“Enfeoffment?”

Io still looked dispirited.

Chris slightly nodded his head as he answered.

“Sir Count Lancephil did not grant land to your retainers because of the reason that the fief was a key border region contiguous to the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom. This was a judgment that managing it as one would be a powerful advantage in border defense.”

Io silently nodded his head.

Chris’ words continued on.

“Due to that, the Count Lancephil House’s retainers, even those whose nobility reached Viscount, don’t have a land of their own. Even when comparing it with just the Count Chase House bordering to the west, there is a big difference compared to the House granting even to those who are baronets a small land.”

“Hmm.”

Io, with an uncomfortable expression, leaked a groan.

He too had noticed to a certain extent that his retainers were feeling disappointed about that part.

But if he were to divide the fief and grant them for personal reasons, a great problem may be created later on during a foreign kingdom’s invasion.

‘Even though I had made sure to give them not a disappointing amount of wages because of that.’

It seemed that it wasn’t enough with just that.

Chris’ words continued on.

“In the middle of that situation, it seems that the dissatisfaction of the Count House’s retainers has reached its peak as Sir Count cut off and granted the southern region of the fief, which included the Tale Region, to our lord. And Kali Owells has pierced through that very point.”

“But even though the land given to Roan was barren and no different than a den of monsters……”

Chris shook his head at Io’s words.

“To the retainers of a Count House who didn’t receive even a palm-sized land, it seems that even a wasteland like that is enviable.”

“Hhm.”

Io, with a quiet groan, closed his eyes.

He had prided in himself for knowing how to treat people with heart, but in reality, he hadn’t understood the feelings of his retainers at all.

“Then what should I do now?”

Io, with his eyes closed, asked.

Chris spoke in a careful voice.

“Firstly, the situation isn’t good, sir. Seeing the County’s military as having gone over to Kali Owells would be correct. If the Count Chase’s troops invade in this situation, we would absolutely lose without even giving a single proper resistance.”

Chris let out a short sigh.

Then laboriously making a smile, he added on.

“But it isn’t as if there isn’t any way, sir.”

However difficult a situation was, a breakthrough was always there.

Already, Roan and Clay should be moving.

Matching that, Chris and Io had to move.

Io slowly opened his eyes and looked at Chris.

Chris laboriously made a brighter smile.

He, with a quiet voice, spoke as if to whisper.

“From now on, we will……”

Like that, the secret conversation continued on for a long time.

Poskein Subjugation End.

T/N: So for the next few chapters, the release dates may be a bit more funky than usual. As it is, the author (according to his notes) is separating the chapters based on the flow of the story, and the length of each chapter will fluctuates a bit more than usual, likely until the end of the Kali Owells/Lancephil County Arc. In fact, the next chapter will be more longer than this one, and you can really expect the flow of the story to accelerate.

I apologize in advance for the inconvenience.

Chapter 155




T/n (CSV): The next chapter will be up either later today or early tomorrow EST.

Update: umm… there is a bit of delay in the editing process, but the chapter should be up at least by tonight.

Splash. Splash.

Low and rolling waves hit the warships.

That was the only sound that was heard.

Everywhere was submerged in darkness and the world was silent.

Huff. Huff.

Soldiers with tense expressions breathed out heated breaths.

At the forecastle stood Roan. 1

Using the Kalian’s Tears, he was glaring at the surface of the lake covered in thick darkness.

‘Incredible.’

From a glance, it was a lake that looked truly peaceful.

But below the surface, more than hundreds of monsters were closing in.

Gulp.

Roan’s expression too was slightly tense.

Slowly, he raised his right hand.

Shuaaah.

The surface swayed greatly.

The monsters that had almost reached the ships had prepared to attack.

Roan, as if he had been waiting, shouted out aloud with a resounding voice.

“Light!”

The powerful voice shattered the silence.

As if it had been waiting, a light blasted out from above the center mast.

Paat!

At the end of the mast, a smooth metallic cylinder was attached.

Within the cylinder, a ball of light the size of a grown man’s head appeared.

The ball of light, following the mouth of the cylinder to the outside, poured out an incredible amount of light.

The light directly shone upon the lake’s surface.

Instantly, the surrounding darkness moved back.

Kieg?

The monsters that had been approaching in the darkness, when the surroundings suddenly became bright, showed greatly panicked looks.

Most of all, the ones who had led the attack this time were nocturnal monster, Kutiers.

These monsters had a weakness of having their skin burn up brightly and momentarily becoming blind when receiving light.

At the light that scathingly beat down as if to burn their flesh, the Kutiers exploded out pained screams.

Kkieeeg!

Paat! Paat!

Ships, numbering more than tens, all shot out light at once.

The Kutiers, which had floated up onto the lake’s surface, couldn’t endure it and raved in madness.

‘Good! There is an effect!’

Roan faintly smiled as he looked at that sight.

The cylinders equipped on the masts were Boat Light that the Engineering Department and the Reno Magic Tower had collaborated together and made.

A type of magic lamp made for ships, it had a function of shooting a light in one direction.

Although it was merely a light to brighten the dark to humans, it could become a lethal and deadly weapon to the Kutiers.

‘I should thank Clay and the Academy Bureau as well as the fief’s scholars.’

Thanks to them working day and night, they could perfectly grasp Poskein Lake’s monster’s habits and weaknesses.

“Fire the arrows!”

The moment the new order fell, a rain of arrows poured down onto the thrashing Kutiers.

Pubububuk!

Kkieek!

The Kutiers turned into porcupines and lost their lives.

A few tried to dive in order to hide themselves once more below the surface.

However, Roan and the Tale Legion had already planned even for that part.

“Pull the iron nets!”

A powerful voice spread from one end of the ships to another.

The Taemusas, who had been in ready, grabbed and turned the levers.

Ggiiig!

With a sound of wood twisting, the ships, which had been standing neatly to the left and right, swayed.

‘Knowing you bastards will run, we have already connected the iron nets between the ships.’

Hanging hooks at the end of the nets, they had connected them to other warships.

Their plan was to lay the iron nets long beneath the surface and pull them up once the monsters dove.

Shwaaaak!

With a great spray of water, the iron nets floated up above the surface of the water.

Iron nets hanging between ships as if it were hammocks.

Above them, the Kutiers that dove and tried to run were tangled into one and squirming.

“Annihilate them!”

Roan, with a new order, kicked off the deck.

Drawing a beautiful arc, he landed on top of the nets.

Unless it was an unavoidable situation, it was better to save the arrows, which were consumable supplies.

Kkieeeg!

The Kutiers, caught in the nets and thrashing from being basked in the light, rushed towards Roan.

But perhaps because of momentarily having lost their eyesight, their movements were simply a mess.

Roan composedly swung the Travias Spear and turned his body.

Ssskuk!

The spearhead, cutting through the light and the dark, bisected the Kutiers at the same time.

Spat! Pabat!

Within Roan’s hands, the Travias Spear repeated to change truly freely.

Becoming elongated and then shortened, turning thicker and then thinner……

Everything was to Roan’s will.

Kung!

The Travias Spear that had turned almost twice as thick as an arm crushed a Kutier.

Puuk!

The head imploded and the body was crushed and caved in.

“Die!”

“Kill them!”

From tens of ships, Soldiers with the Taemusas at the lead poured down onto the iron nets.

The ones leading them at the head were the commanders of thousand-man and higher.

As all ones who had accompanied Roan from long ago, their current skills were at an level equal to novice knights.

Although there still was a long way to go if looking at just the level of mana techniques and the martial arts, it wasn’t so for group combat.

In the case of the Tale Legion, through the future’s training methods, an advanced organization system, small-scale tactics and so on that Roan knew, they showed incredible strength in many on many combat.

Each and every individual soldier was showing a powerful martial strength above his own capability.

In short, the Tale Legion was strong.

And.

“You dare!”

Roan roared as he kicked off the iron nets and soar into the air.

When he put power into his wrists, the pole of the spear trembled and warped circularly, then split the air as if flicked.

It was a powerful strike.

Puuck!

Five Kutiers literally exploded.

Most of all, Roan’s martial strength now exceeded the level of a regular knight.

At that moment.

[Roan! Something is approaching from the water!]

He heard Kinis’ sharp voice.

Roan butched the kutiers pouncing near him then climbed up onto a ship’s deck.

Zzirit.

Goose bumps rose through his skin.

A powerful killing intent that couldn’t be felt until now.

Using the Kalian’s Tears, he glared below the surface of the water.

Suddenly, Roan instinctively shouted.

“Retreat! Retreat! Untie the iron nets!”

An urgent shout rang out.

Instantly, a sound of a gong signalling retreat rang out.

Jiing! Jiing! Jiing!

With puzzled looks, the soldiers who had been massacring the monsters above the nets retreated.

No, they tried to retreat.

At that instant.

Shwaaaaack!

The surface of the lake broke in a long line and a wave of water exploded.

The soldiers who were climbing back onto the ships unknowingly looked at the place the splash of water exploded and soared.

The faces stiffened solidly.

“Ah……”

A deep and despairing sigh drew and exploded out.

The entire bodies’ muscles completely froze.

Roan too was feeling a horrifying and atrocious nervousness.

“What is this……”

A face and voice that seemed to find it hard to believe.

His eyes were looking at the lake, where the blast of water fell.

*****

A sense of relaxation overflowed in Kali Owells’ steps.

A faint smile hung on his mouth.

‘Io Lancephil.’

Laughter kept popping out.

‘Without knowing just how the situation is turning, for him to send his forces that he at least had left to Tale Barony……’

A cold light hung at the edge of his eyes.

‘At least, I will be thankful that he did that. Kuk.’

A vicious smile rose up all the way to his throat.

He calmed his breath for a moment in front of Io Lancephil’s office.

The office he had visited more than tens, hundreds of times.

The feeling felt fresh today.

‘It’s nearing forty years already.’

Thirty seven years.

Those were the years that Kali had followed Io.

Originally, the House of Owells was a very loyal retainer that had served the Lancephil House for generations.

For a long time, it had named itself as Lancephil House’s right hand.

But in the war with the Byron Kingdom 50 years ago, the Owells House had sustained an enormous damage of a degree that was difficult to come back from.

The head of the house of that generation as well as the house’s core knights had all been killed.

Although the Lancephil House had sincerely and fully supported the Owells House that was like that, the house whose strength had waned once couldn’t stand back up easily.

During that time, Kali Owells was born.

From the time he was young, he had gritted his teeth and strived only in swordsmanship training.

His talent too was outstanding and he soon had obtained an outstanding skill in swordsmanship.

‘I had thought that the only method to raise the fallen house back up was swordsmanship.’

A bitter smile hung on Kali’s mouth.

He wished to reenact the house’s old glory with his own hands.

Kali during his youth was always covered in dirt.

He had repeated training upon training to such degree.

Perhaps thanks to such effort, he had appeared in the eyes of Io Lancephil, who was leading the Lancephil House at that time.

Io had personally selected Kali, who had tenacity and outstanding swordsmanship skill despite the young age, and assigned him to the fief knight order.

‘Since then, I have roamed the battlefield as if mad.’

Io was a brave general that was hard to be seen amongst the nobles.

Following him, Kali experienced tens, hundreds of battles.

The military merits continuously piled up.

His status and rank went up little by little, and he was granted even a status of a noble.

Soon, the house that had fallen regained its era of prosperity.

‘I wished to aid Io Lancephil and head out into a greater world.’

He wished to earn a greater fame and power, and a greater wealth and glory.

But the moment Io became a count, he moved his fief to a remote northeastern region on his own and focused only on border defense.

Kali, who was fully burning up fiercely at the time, couldn’t hold back his shock.

The dauntless spirit, which had tried to go beyond the kingdom and command the continent, lost its way and fell straight into the earth.

Furthermore.

‘Under the pretext of border defense, he didn’t even confer a fief.’

What kind of a noble house was a house without even a single palm-sized land?

The Owells House that was recovering its prosperity was stalled just like that.

Kali was enraged.

However, he did not heedlessly show such feeling or carelessly acted.

There was a chance.

‘Since Io Lancephil doesn’t have a family.’

He thought that if he continued to remain as the right hand and support him, the Lancephil County’s successor would naturally be him.

Of course, he didn’t lean only on a vague anticipation like that.

Very slowly, carefully, Kali changed the core and chief executives of the knight order, the magic corp, and the fief regiment to his own people.

Plainly, the current head of the magic corp Tairon Bess and the captain of the fief regiment Perry Wilson were no different than his close subordinates.

‘At the same time, I even learned how to conceal myself.’

While filling the core forces with his own people, Kali himself leisurely spent a long time as the vice head of the knight order before becoming the head.

Thanks to that, there weren’t many people, including Io and within his subordinates, who were suspicious of Kali.

Of course, Kali didn’t plan to betray Io using his own faction as his base.

‘I merely tried to inherit the County through a just method.’

He planned to officially inherit the fief from Io, who had no son.

But recently, Io showed actions he had absolutely not expected.

Not only did he take off and gave a part of the fief to Roan, a fool who had abruptly appeared, he started treating him as if he was a son.

‘If this continues, the County’s successor will become Roan .’

The situation was such that anyone would have such thought.

Kali became enraged.

The rage of this time leaped over the rage of the old.

The time of tens of years he had supported him at the side could become a foam in an instant.

Thankfully, ones with dissatisfaction like Kali appeared even amongst Io’s close aides.

Kali persuaded them and strengthened his original faction.

‘Io Lancephil.’

The teeth gritted.

He glared coldly at the office’s door.

‘This is all something that happened because of you. This isn’t my fault.’

Kali thought that he was betrayed first.

“Huu.”

He forcefully spat out a long sigh and calmed his heart.

The cold light that hung at the edge of his eyes were already gone.

Kali carefully knocked on the door.

“It’s Kali Owells.”

He spoke in a soft and subdued voice.

“Come in.”

Soon, Io’s voice was heard.

Kali slowly opened the door.

“My lord.”

“Yes. What is it?”

Sending away Eik Lamus, who he had been chatting with, Io offered a seat on the opposite side to Kali.

“I heard that you are transferring the troops to Tale Barony.”

“Since there is a promise from the other day. It seems the Tale Legion had already began to subjugate the Poskein Lake.”

Kali slowly nodded at Io’s words.

‘Io Lancephil. It’s because of you pampering and coddling Roan like that, that it became this state.’

A curse flooded up.

However, Kali didn’t show his feelings and smiled.

“Yes. Since loyalty between nobles is most important. I would like to transfer our fief’s elite troop as well as the knight order and the magic corps together if I could, but……”

His expression said that it was very difficult.

“Because the western border region has been unusual recently, we can’t disperse our forces.”

It was a contemptible excuse.

“The western border?”

Words asking despite fully knowing it.

Kali didn’t change his expression a single bit and laid out lies.

“Chase County’s movements are unusual. We will have to move the knight order, the magic corp, and a part of fief regiment’s forces to the west.”

As if it was the truth, boldness rubbed off of his words.

Io wordlessly stared straight into Kali’s two eyes.

Within the soft outline of his eyes, the hard and incorruptible eyes flashed a light.

Those were the lights of the brave general Io that had roamed the battlefields in the past.

‘Hhm.’

Kali felt himself unknowingly sweating a cold sweat.

‘Did this old man perhaps……’

Despite him thinking that he had aged all the way, he still held the pressure of a tiger.

At the gaze that seemed to pierce through his heart, Kali’s heart loudly beat as if a thief ached his own leg. 2

He wanted to pull out and raise the sword at his waist at any second.

At that moment.

The shape of Io’s eyes curved softly and the tips of his mouth slantingly went up.

It was a bright smile.

“I see. Please take care of it well yourself.”

His voice was dripping with trust.

‘Huu.’

Kali felt his muscles that had completely tensed loosen up.

Inwardly calming his shocked heart, he lowered his head.

“Yes. Please don’t worry. I will personally go to the west.”

Kali gave a short salute and stood up from the seat.

The two people, for a moment and without a word, stared into each other’s eyes.

Complicated feelings went back and forth.

‘Kali.’

‘Io Lancephil.’

A master, servant, and a comrade that had spent tens of years together.

The hearts fell down heavily.

The one who broke the silence was Kali.

“Then I will now……”

Smiling awkwardly, he stepped back.

When Kali just reached in front of the office’s door.

“Commander Owells.”

Io called and stopped Kali.

Kali wordlessly turned his head and looked at Io.

“Commander Owells. No……”

Io, for some reason, made a sad smile.

“Muddy Kali.”

“Ah……!”

Instantly, Kali let out a quiet exclamation.

Muddy Kali.

That was his nickname during his youth.

Because Kali didn’t rest a single day and trained when he was young, his entire body was always muddy.

Io had called Kali, who was like that, Muddy Kali and coddled him.

“How many years has it been since we worked together?”

Even his style of speech changed.

At Io’s question, Kali answered without a delay.

“It’s the 37th year, sir.”

“It’s been quite a while.”

Io cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

Kali too slowly nodded his head.

Io exhaled a short sigh.

“For some reason, these days, I miss those days.”

The days when they trusted their backs together and roamed the battlefield.

Kali wordlessly lowered his head and then opened the office’s door.

The tips of his fingers kept shaking and his heart beat rapidly.

On the other hand, his face calmed down ghostly pale.

‘Io Lancephil. No, Sir Count Lancephil.’

He gritted his teeth.

‘We have come much too far.’

As long as the days they spent together, they had instead fallen apart as much as that time.

Kali forcefully smiled and moved his steps.

‘Now, we cannot go back to that time.’

The face that had been pale returned back.

On the brightly flushed face, a cold killing intent hung.

The heart that momentarily shook returned to its place.

After Kali exited the office, Eik showed himself once again.

“What did he say?”

It was a voice that was spat out while forcefully pushing down on the rage that flew up.

Io wordlessly made a bitter smile.

He didn’t wish to have a long talk with his current feelings.

Seemingly understanding Io’s such desire, Eik, with a short sigh, spoke in a quiet voice.

“The troop that will be going to the Tale Barony will leave at dawn tomorrow. My lord, use seeing them off as an excuse and please travel until the plain north of the Pavor Castle on a carriage.”

When his words reached about that point, Io let out a long sigh.

“Eik. However I think about it, I don’t like this plan. How could I leave you and go alone by……”

When his words reached about that point.

“My lord.”

Eik, with a firm and harsh expression, shook his head.

“We need someone who will remain here and deceive the traitors’ eyes. I am merely honored to have undertook this heavy responsibility. Please don’t care too much.”

His voice became even smaller and furtive.

“Please bear in mind. Even if the entire Lancephil County fell into Count Chase’s hands, we can raise the House of Count again at any time as long as my lord is alive. My lord, please only think about the safety of lord.”

His voice dripped with loyalty.

Io spat out a long sigh and held Eik’s hands.

There was no need for words.

All the sincerity was passed through the heat of the body and the light in the eyes.

Io resolved his determination to definitely remain alive, condemn the traitors, and raise the House of Count once again.

He planned to do his utmost for his loyal subjects, who didn’t leave his side and remained despite when the situation became difficult.

However, Io was at an age already passed sixty.

Just where did the spirit and vigor from his youth went, he exhaled a sigh while looking at the back of his hand that had became wrinkled already.

The old Io’s heart was too soft.

*****

“Captain Wilson.”

“Yes. Commander Owells.”

Kali Owells, before heading to the western border, met the head of the magic corp Tairon Bess and the captain of the fief regiment Perry Wilson.

“I am scheduled to soon head west with commander Bess. Captain Wilson will remain at the Pavor Castle and watch Io Lancephil well so that he doesn’t do anything unnecessary.”

“Please don’t worry, sir.”

Perry answered with an expression overflowing with confident.

But Kali’s expression was not satisfied.

‘Him being excessively conceited compared to his abilities hangs on my mind.’

Although Perry had abilities outstanding enough to undertake the role of the captain of the County House’s fief regiment, his conceit was much stronger than that.

Because of that, there were times when he spoiled the work now and then.

‘Since the situation has already become like this after all, what kind of thing could even happen……’

Furthermore, Io’s close subordinates who were eyesores were scheduled to all leave to Tale Barony by tomorrow morning.

Now, the Lancephil County was no different than Kali’s world.

Kali forcefully pushed away the uneasy feeling.

“The moment the news that we attacked the Chase County is delivered, lock up Io Lancephil and execute the state of emergency.”

“Yes. Understood. But……”

Perry, who had been answering instantly, slightly creased his forehead and asked.

“Is there really any need for us to attack the Chase County first? It would be okay even if the Chase County Forces push and come in.”

At those words, Kali shook his head with a short sigh.

“It is to push the cause of the fief war’s outbreak onto Io Lancephil. Only then……”

His eyes flashed and shined a light.

“It becomes easier to fabricate the work at the capital’s side.”

“Ah……”

With a quiet exclamation, Perry nodded his head.

Kali inwardly shook his head at that sight and filled his wine cup.

“Although today it’s the toast for the declaration of war, let us drink a toast of victory the next time.”

At those words, Tairon and Perry brightly smiled and raised their cups.

The three people lightly tapped their cups and, in one breath, emptied their cups.

A slightly bitter wine wetted the throats.

‘Come to think of it, there is a good wine in Io Lancephil’s reception room……’

A faint smile hung on Kali’s mouth.

‘I should drink that once the work ends.’

Already, it felt as if the tip of his tongue became sweet.

Of course, although that aftertaste would be quite bitter.

‘I’ll leave that bitter taste as a memory of you. Io Lancephil.’

That day, Kali and Tairon led the knight order, the magic corp, and the fief elite troops and left towards the west.

Perry, who had remained at the Pavor Castle, drastically increased the number of guards on the grounds of strengthening public order.

Io went up to the spire and let out a long sigh as he looked at that sight.

‘It is no longer the Lancephil County that I knew of.’

It felt as if he had held it in his hands for much too long.

The light in his eyes darkly abated.

“Is now the time to let it go?”

Suddenly, the past years brushed by like a wind.

Exhaling a sigh mixed with regret, Io turned his head.

The gaze that was looking towards the west turned to south.

At the end of that place lied the Poskein Lake.

Poskein Subjugation (3) End.

Chapter 156




T/n (CSV): The next chapter will be up tomorrow.

He had never seen it in reality.

But there were times when he had heard of it through words, rumors, and stories.

No, there were many times.

It was an existence that famous.

He had thought that it would be horrifying.

But he hadn’t predicted that it could possibly be to such degree.

Sethus was more gigantic than any monster he had seen until now.

Boom!

With a thunderous boom, the forecastle of the left ship was pulverized.

“Uaaak!”

“Run! The ship is sinking!”

The soldiers ran towards the stern as they shouted.

“Throw the ropes! Save our comrades!”

“Leave the sinking ship!”

Tens of ropes were thrown from the ships that were still intact.

“Turn the bow around with the ropes still thrown! Run!”

“Retreat to the lakeside!”

The retreat order quickly fell.

But.

Boom!

When Sethus swung its enormous arm once, another ship shattered once more.

‘Damn it.’

Roan stood on the flagship’s deck and scowled at Sethus.

Sethus almost brought to mind a whale with arms and legs.

There was no difference between the head and the body, and it had a short back legs, a tail, and long forelegs.

It was a monster that usually swam or walked using the four legs to move deep below the lake, and could stand erect using its hind legs and tail.

‘To think it will appear so quickly.’

He knew that Sethus lived in the Poskein Lake.

However, he thought that they won’t be meeting it until they advanced to the Exos Island.

Because it was a monster that lived at much too deep place.

‘Is even the boat light ineffective……’

Sethus was also a monster that was categorized as nocturnal.

But unlike Kutier, it didn’t show any particular reaction to even the boat light.

Boom!

With a sound of explosion, another ship was destroyed again.

Roan quickly called Harrison.

“Harrison. All ships retreat!”

“Yes! Understood.”

Harrison, the captain of the Roan’s direct Amaranth troop and a thousand-man commander, immediately gave the retreat order.

Soon, the sound of horn signalling all fleet’s retreat echoed.

Vvuuuuuu!

As if they had been waiting, the ships that had been panicking turned their bows around and began to retreat.

But.

Boom!

There was no way that Sethus would stay still and watch that sight.

Swinging its long arms, it adroitly strode and moved its steps.

Each time, an amazing swell of water hit the ships.

“Uak!”

“Throw the safety lines!”

“Grab the safety line!”

“Save those who have fallen into the lake!”

Screams endlessly flooded out from here and there.

Watching the ally ships being helplessly destroyed, Roan gritted his teeth.

‘Damn it. Can’t be helped.’

He couldn’t stay and simply watch like that.

Forget retreat, the allies were in danger of being annihilated.

“Kinis.”

[Un?]

“Please create a water column.”

While glaring at Sethus, Roan moved to the end of the forecastle.

[Roan. You aren’t possibly thinking of fighting that bulk, right?]

Kinis asked back with a shocked voice.

Instead of an answer, Roan nodded his head.

‘I will protect my soldiers.’

Although his expression was solid and stiff, a strong determination and an unwavering will could be glanced.

[You really aren’t sane either.]

Kinis grumbled as she shook her head.

But she didn’t repeatedly ask back or stop him.

It was because Roan and Kinis, who were tied with a spirit contract, could share their feelings to a certain degree.

[Alright. Then here I go.]

“Please.”

A short conversation passed.

Suddenly, columns of water soared between the flagship and Sethus.

Roan moved without a delay.

Taat!

He kicked off the bow then stepped on the water columns one after another.

“Aa! My lord!”

“Lord!”

The soldiers shouted with shocked expressions.

Roan shouted without minding it.

“You guys retreat as is!”

The lord Roan’s orders were absolute.

But even so, they couldn’t leave Roan alone in danger and retreat.

Harrison quickly gave a new order.

“All ships besides the flagship retreat!”

“Then what will we……”

One soldier cautiously asked.

Harrison, as he stared at the back of Roan stepping on the columns of water and heading forwards, answered.

“The lord has staked his life for us. We will wait for the lord here.”

“Yes sir!”

The soldier didn’t ask anymore and saluted.

Soon, the sound of horn signalling the retreat of all fleet echoed.

Meanwhile, Roan had neared Sethus.

The sight of him holding the Travis Spear slantingly behind him and kicking and running on top of the columns of water was truly a sight of a hero.

The sight of not stepping back even with the gigantic Sethus in front.

The Tale Legion’s soldiers who were watching trembled in awe.

‘That man is our lord!’

‘Lord!’

‘Lord, please be strong!’

‘We are behind you!’

Burning sensations rose up within their chests.

Their entire bodies shivered and trembled.

They couldn’t hold back anymore.

“Uaaaaaaah!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

The soldiers raised their hands high and cheered.

Thunderous voices rang and echoed the Poskein Lake.

The spirits carried on the voices stormed like a whirlwind and pushed Roan’s back.

“You guys……”

Faintly smiling at the spirits felt behind his back, Roan kicked off the last water column.

Sethus’ slick body was right in front of his nose.

Kwaaaaaa!

Sethus too had noticed Roan running towards him.

An incredible scream that felt as if the eardrums would burst exploded out.

Slightly creasing his forehead, Roan stabbed the Travias Spear into the slick and gigantic body.

Ssskuk!

The spearhead skewered deeply.

But no particular reaction came from Sethus.

To it, it was an attack similar to getting bit by a mosquito.

Sethus’ elongated arm flew towards Roan.

“Damn it.”

Spitting out a curse, Roan used the Travias Spear as an axis to turn his body and soar into the air.

Sssuung!

With a powerful gust, the monster’s arm cut through an empty space.

“Kinis!”

[Got it!]

At Roan’s call, Kinis put her hands together into a circle.

Suddenly, a round drop of water appeared in the air.

Quickly stepping on the drop of water, Roan jumped into the air once more.

Turning his body in the air, he climbed up on top of Sethus’ enormous arm.

Kwaaah!

With a horrible scream, Sethus tried to squish down on Roan with the opposite hand.

Looking at the incredible-sized hand, Roan quickly threw his body.

Tatat!

The sight of running on top of Sethus’ elongated and long arm.

To the Tale Legion’s soldiers’ eyes, it truly was a close sight.

Puuuckk!

With an earsplitting boom, Sethus’ hand clapped its arm.

Gulp.

With nervous expressions, everyone gulped.

At that moment, Roan jumped up on top of the hand.

“Ah……”

Exclamations of relief popped out from everywhere.

“Huu.”

Roan too spat out a short breath.

Once again, he climbed the arm and raced towards Sethus’ face.

‘Having a large size is both an advantage and disadvantage.’

To Sethus, Roan was truly an annoying opponent.

He was small and quick.

Of course, that didn’t mean that it was easy for Roan to take on Sethus.

If it was a normal human, it was close to impossible to cause a critical hit on it whether one swung a sword and stabbed a spear.

‘But that is……’

Roan’s eyes flashed and shone with light.

‘Stories of people without the Travias Spear.’

For him, there was the Travias Spear, which could freely change its length and thickness.

‘My mana needs to hold on.’

The problem was only the mana inside his body.

If only the mana was plenty enough, he could change the Travias Spear to almost the size of Sethus.

Tat!

Roan kicked off Sethus’ arm and jumped towards its face.

An eye as big as a ship was right in front of his nose.

“Hahap!”

With a shout, Roan thrusted the Travias Spear.

The mana within the mana hole rose up as if to soar and flowed into the Travias Spear.

Psht!

The Travis Spear, which was the size of a regular spear, flashed with light and then its length and width instantly started to become bigger.

It was a size that was simply difficult to hold with one hand.

Roan held the end of the spear with two hands and aimed at Sethus’ eye.

Sssggk!

The spear that became as thick as the size of a man’s body pierced its eye.

Using the mana within his body, he could increase the length of the spear at best to a length of a ship and a width of about Roan’s body was the limit.

Although it still was absurdly insufficient level compared to Sethus’ size, it was enough to give it a damage.

Furthermore, the attacked area was good.

At the pain of its eye being ripped out, the monster thrashed.

Kuaaaah!

With a horrible scream, the two hands flew towards the face.

‘You dare!’

Roan quickly returned the Travias Spear to its original size, then kicked off its eye and soared into space.

Ppuuk!

Sethus’ two hands hit its own face.

Roan stepped on the tip of its finger and climbed up to the top of its head.

“Die!”

While holding the Travias Spear with both hands, he pushed and stabbed it directly into the top of Sethus’ head.

Simultaneously, he pulled up his mana and enlarged the Travias Spear to its maximum size once again.

Pshshshshk!

As the length became longer and the thickness became thicker, the sound of flesh being pushed out hit the ears.

Kuaaaaa!

With a scream, Sethus swung its arm again.

However, Roan had already dodged that place and moved to another spot.

Once again, he stabbed the Travis Spear into its body.

He thought that if he continued to damage it the same way, the monster wouldn’t be able to last.

‘Stab twice if it doesn’t fall with a single stab, and stab three times if it doesn’t fall with two stabs. I’ll stab and stab again until it falls.’

That was Roan’s method.

But at that instant.

Uung. Uung.

A strange vibration was felt from the place he stabbed the spear.

“Huhph.”

At the same time, the surrounding felt lumpy.

A sense as if the Travias Spear he stabbed into the body was being pulled in.

Roan quickly set his balance and pulled out the spear.

Uung! Uung!

The vibration steadily became stronger.

Suddenly.

[Run!]

Kinis’ panicked shout was heard.

The instant Roan turned his head wondering what it was, the skin below his feet flashed with a blue light.

“Hph!”

Instinctively, Roan pulled his entire mana to protect his body, and simultaneously and repeatedly executed the shield spell amongst the spells carved within the Brent’s Ring.

All the mana within his body soared up.

The moment a transparent membrane covered his entire body.

Paat!

Sethus’ body that had became lumpy widely opened up and an incredible jet of water gushed out.

Puuuuuk!

An incredible impact hit his entire body.

“Kuuk!”

With his teeth gritted, Roan curled up his body.

Just like that, Roan was bounced off as he was hit by the jet of water.

[No!]

With an alarmed voice, Kinis quickly created drops of water.

Tens of water drops appeared.

However, the speed Roan was bounced out at was too fast.

Pop! Popop! Pop!

The instant the water drops collided with Roan, they couldn’t endure the impact and popped.

Puuuuuk!

In the end, Roan bounced and flew off the water’s surface like a skipping stone and soon was pounded into the water.

Ggllllllk.

At the place he sank, bubbles arose.

“My, my lord!”

At the situation that suddenly happened, the soldiers on the flagship gasped and yelled.

“Move! Move! We will go rescue the lord!”

Harrison shouted aloud at the top of his lungs.

Ggiiig.

The flagship that hadn’t moved even a bit even with the Sethus in front of them began to move with a sound of wood twisting.

Meanwhile, Roan was sinking endlessly.

The arms and legs drooped powerlessly and his conscious was faint.

But despite so, he was holding at least the Travias Spear tight in his hand.

‘What happened……’

Thanks to the Brent’s Ring, there was no problem breathing even while underwater.

Of course, even this had a limit with the current state of mana.

‘I remember being hit by something like a stream of water and……kuuk.’

Suddenly, an amazing pain assaulted him.

A feeling as if the bones of his entire body was shattered into pieces.

Also.

‘Did even the mana hole reach its bottom?’

He had spent all the remaining mana to protect his body.

‘If I stay like this, I will die.’

It was impossible to know how deep the Poskein Lake was.

But if he continued to sink like that, it felt like he would forever be unable to go out into the world.

Furthermore, it was also impossible to know how long the effect of the Brent’s Ring that allowed him to breath underwater would continue.

‘I have to move.’

Even though it was painful, he had to endure.

Roan tried to pull in the limbs that powerlessly drooped.

At that moment.

He felt killing intents that electrified and trembled his skin was felt.

Roan turned only his neck and looked around the surroundings.

Thanks to Kalian’s Tears, he could even clearly see the underwater sights that light didn’t touch.

‘Kutiers……’

Kutiers were swarming towards his surroundings.

The monsters remembered Roan, who had ruthlessly massacred their comrades.

They bared their sharp teeth and extended sharp and long nails.

‘Will I die like this……’

The body still didn’t move as he wished.

It was almost impossible to take on all of them.

But he had no plans to giving up and welcome death just like that.

‘There is no impossible in my life.’

He tightened his heart that was scattering.

It was a life that he had stood up from despite falling again and again and had stubbornly walked.

There was no way that he could simply give up even if a foot was caught at the door of death.

‘I will kill at least one more of you.’

Perhaps because of the firm will, the limbs that hadn’t listened moved.

‘Kuuk.’

Of course, an amazing pain assaulted each time.

Roan took that pain as a source of his strength.

With fierce and sharp eyes, he glared at the Kutiers.

‘Come!’

His spirit at least was of a greatest general under the sky. 1

At that moment.

[You really are an absurd guy.]

A sharp and buzzing voice was heard.

It was Kinis.

Roan wished to greet her at the somehow happy feeling, but he couldn’t say any words because he was underwater.

‘Even though it might be the last…… can I not even greet her?’

He felt a regretful feeling.

[What last? Didn’t you say that there is no give up in your life?]

Kinis’ voice was heard.

‘Un?’

Roan made a puzzled look.

‘You can hear my voice?’

Words passed through thought.

[I can hear it. No, not just hear it……]

The end of her words blurred.

At the same time, a current oscillated in front of Roan’s eyes.

A current swaying under the water was truly fantastic.

As if a whirlwind, it spinned round and round then soon burst apart towards everywhere.

At the place the whirlpool disappeared.

A women with a blue colored hair and skin tinted with a red light appeared.

A girl of short height that only reached up to Roan’s waist.

The girl turned her head and looked at Roan.

A face that somehow looked like a mischief.

[You can see me now, right?]

She casually threw those words.

Roan widely opened his eyes.

‘Are you perhaps Kinis?’

At those words, the girl slowly nodded her head.

[Yeah. I’m Kinis.]

Her small and pretty lips moved softly.

Smiling faintly, Kinis shrugged her shoulders.

[Aren’t I prettier than you thought]

Those were words that completely did not match the situation.

Chapter 157




A strange nervousness hung on the border of the Lancephil County and the Chase County.

With the border region as the center, the Count Lancephil Forces and the Count Chase Forces scowled at each other.

No. It looked as if they were scowling.

The strange nervousness too was not directed at each other.

“Should we soon begin?”

One of Count Lancephil’s captains cautiously asked.

Kali Owells quietly stared at the Count Chase Forces over the border, then slowly nodded his head.

“After crossing the fief border, shoot the arrows towards the ground. The cavalry will move left and right rapidly and leave footprints, and the foot soldiers will throw away the broken spears, swords, and the shields.”

“Yes. Understood.”

There was no look of being puzzled even at the strange order.

Vvuuuu!

Soon, the sound of horn signalling the march echoed.

Unlike the normal tactics, the archer troop moved first and then crossed over the fief border.

It was undeniably a military invasion.

However, the Count Chase Forces instead merely smiled brightly as they watched that sight and didn’t move thoughtlessly.

The archer troop, which had entered the Chase County, moved around this way and that and shot arrows at empty grounds.

Pbubububuk!

Tens, hundreds of arrows futilely crossed the empty space and planted themselves into the ground.

The cavalry and the foot soldiers swept through afterwards.

As according to Kali’s order, the cavalry moved erratically left and right and left footprints, and the foot soldiers threw broken or bloodied weapons onto the ground.

A moment later.

Jiing! Jiing! Jiing!

The sound of gong signalling retreat rang out.

The archer troop, the cavalry, and the foot soldier troop all moved back and returned to the Lancephil Fief.

Hazy dusts fell down upon the place they left.

No matter who saw it, it was undeniably a sight of battlefield.

It was a battlefield fabricated with lies.

“Excellent.”

Viscount Royce Fielder, who received the role of Count Chase Forces’ supreme commander, made a faint smile.

His gaze went towards Kali on the other side.

‘I knew it will become like this.’

Royce knew Kali well.

It was because their ages were similar and had also spent a long time as rivals.

He knew that Kali would betray Io.

‘That bastard is probably blaming Count Lancephil.’

But that was Kali’s misjudgment.

The smile hanging on his mouth began much thicker.

‘There is no way Count Lancephil would pass the fief to a bastard like you.’

The existences called humans were essentially like that.

While the eyes for looking at others were bright, the eyes for looking at themselves were dim.

Due to that, most people didn’t know what their own faults were.

Kali too was the same.

‘In the first place, Count Lancephil who values people without discriminating status and you who are busy taking care of your own profit were opposites.’

Royce clicked his tongue.

If he was going to serve, he should had served a similar person.

Like him.

‘There really is no one like our Sir Count Chase who is all wrapped up with ambition.’

Royce and Count Jonathan Chase’s personalities were completely same.

Furthermore, Jonathan lightly ignored the process, unlike Io, as long as the result was good.

If one could just fill his ambition, he valued and used any one.

‘He doesn’t poorly treat his retainers just because of the lowly things. He grants lots of fiefs too. Kukuku.’

If Kali served Jonathan from the start, he would have achieved a large wealth and power in his hands.

No, truthfully said, it wasn’t a bad choice even now.

Because of that, this fief war was very important from Royce’s position.

‘Kali. I can’t leave you bastard to raise a big merit and serve Sir Count Chase.’

He had no desire to share the wealth and power with Kali.

‘You will have to die in this fief war.’

Of course, it wasn’t something Jonathan wanted.

No, he had no interest whether Kali lived or died.

The important thing was to gain the Lancephil County in his hands.

‘It should be fine to say he died during a chaotic battle.’

If he gave even that much excuse, Jonathan won’t delve any further.

Royce raised his right hand as he smiled frighteningly.

Coincidently, a west wind blew.

“Charge.”

He spoke in a low and unperturbed voice.

The Count Chase Forces rode the west wind and charged towards the East.

Dududududu!

The sound of horse hooves noisily rang out.

Kali and the Count Lancephil Forces stared at the Count Chase Forces that were approaching and then slowly turned their horses.

The direction the horses turned to was East.

They too made preparation to ride the west wind and charge towards the East.

Kali raised up his right hand high.

“Charge!”

A resounding voice echoed the land.

Dududududu.

The Count Lancephil Forces, no, the Viscount Owells Forces and the Count Chase Forces massed together into one and charged towards the East.

It was the moment the Rinse Kingdom’s peace, which had continued on dangerously, shattered.

Lancephil Fief versus Chase Fief.

The Count Lancephil Forces versus Count Chase Forces and Viscount Owells Forces.

Like that, the fief war that would change many things began.

*****

‘What happened to you?’

Roan still made a surprised expression.

Although seeing Kinis was also surprising, the look that was different than what he had heard was also surprising.

‘Didn’t she say she was only about a size of a palm?’

Those were words he inwardly repeated alone.

But it seemed that those words were clearly heard in Kinis’ ears.

[I abruptly grew like this all of a sudden. Also……]

Smiling peculiarly, Kinis extended her hands towards a Kutier that had already neared them.

Puung!

Suddenly, a ball of water burst out from her hands.

A ball of water made underneath the water.

That was truly an odd sight.

[My power got stronger too.]

Her voice overflowed with confidence.

Although her appearance was still that of a cute and young girl, she was still a spirit.

A strange mysteriousness and beauty coexisted.

Pop! Pbung! Pop!

Kinis continuously shot out balls of water towards the Kutiers that were approaching.

Although they were wiggly and slow looking attacks, they actually were very powerful strikes.

The Kutiers either had their skull broken or shattered.

But even so, it wasn’t as if Kinis’ situation was leisurely.

[Uwa! There’s seriously a lot!]

The Kutiers they faced with the boat lights and iron nets were at most a portion of them.

The Kutiers under the water were incredibly many to a point of being hard to count with eyes.

Pop! Pbung! Pop!

Kinis once again shot out balls of water and then turned to Roan.

[What are you doing? Are you just going to keep watching like that?]

At those words, Roan made a bitter smile.

‘I want to help too, but the mana within me was completely depleted.’

[Mana? What are you talking about?]

Kinis creased her forehead.

‘I spent all the mana inside me to block Sethus’ atta……’

When his words had reached that point.

Kinis creased her brows as if saying what are you talking about.

[Then what’s that inside your mana hole?]

‘Mana hole?’

Creasing his brows, Roan focused his mind on his mana hole again.

‘Just what is she saying is in there?’

The mana hole was still completely empty.

But even so, there was no way that Kinis would make up empty words.

With the mana hole as the center, Roan slowly felt the energy around it.

Suddenly.

‘Ah……’

His eyes widely opened.

‘What is this?’

It wasn’t the mana hole.

To be exact, it was the exterior that wrapped around the mana hole.

An energy that felt completely different than the original mana was there.

If the mana hole’s mana tinged a pure heat due to filling it with the Flamdor Mana Technique, the mana of the mana hole’s exterior was.

‘Water?’

It was a flawless water energy.

A pure essence of water.

‘Why is this……?’

Roan couldn’t understand it.

According to the words queen of water Biate left and words Kinis had said, it was a fact that he had absorbed the essence of water.

He had also realized that it was also the essence of water that had saved his life when he lost his mind and the Flamdor Mana Technique rampaged at the end of the war with the Istel Kingdom.

But that was all.

After that, he couldn’t feel the aura of water, the water energy anywhere in his body.

But because a more stable compression and management of mana became possible as he trained the Flamdor Mana Technique, he thought that the essence of water had naturally dissipated as it took on such role.

But.

‘It has been wrapped around the mana hole?’

And a water energy this powerful and plenty at that?

‘How did something like this happen?’

It was something that he simply couldn’t understand.

In truth, although Roan didn’t realize it, it was thanks to water spirit king Ellaim’s arrangement that water energy, and extremely pure water energy at that, was hidden inside his body.

So that the pure water energy won’t unknowingly become active before Roan realized the essence of water by himself, she had placed a limit that wasn’t quite a limit.

Only, in order to stop at least the situation where Roan becomes swept up by the Flamdor Mana Technique and rampage, she had chosen the surface of the mana hole instead of the head or the heart and hid the water energy.

Although he wasn’t a human that was quite likable to her, since he did inherit Biate’s will at any rate, she wished to stop him from meaninglessly losing his life.

But an event that even Ellaim too didn’t expect happened.

The moment Roan used up the heat that had fully filled his mana hole, he sank into the Poskein Lake where a piece of Biate was asleep.

When the two events happened simultaneously, the pure water energy that was wrapped around the mana hole had opened its eyes on its itself.

A coincidence and a coincidence had overlapped, and he had earned an opportunity that he hadn’t even thought of.

Thanks to that, Kinis, whose strength was energetically overflowing thanks to the Poskein Lake even without it, received the effect of Roan’s water energy and could repeat a growth after growth.

Of course, Roan as well as Kinis too wasn’t able to guessed such truth at all.

‘Anyway, a water energy that I could use instead of heat appeared.’

And an extremely pure and amazingly great amount of water energy.

But there still was a problem.

‘Could I used the Flamdor Mana Technique to pull up and use the water energy?’

Even if he simply thought about it, it was something absolutely impossible.

There was even a possibility that the mana could rampage if not careful.

At that moment.

[Roan! Hey! Just how long are you going to stay like that?]

Kinis’ panicked voice was heard.

Already, Kutiers were tightly closed in around her surroundings.

It was a situation that Kinis could be in danger if not careful.

‘Damn it. To think it’s a situation where I can’t use the mana even when it’s there!’

Even thoughts of blindly trying out the Flamdor Mana Technique came to his mind.

‘I would have at least tried it if I knew any other mana techniq…… ah!’

Suddenly, Roan’s mind abruptly got hold of itself as if he was hit on the head.

‘There is one!’

There was one other mana technique that he knew.

The mana technique that anyone knew of as long as they are higher commander than a thousand-man commander.

‘The Tale Mana Technique.’

The very man who had trained the Tale Mana Technique first right after Brian finished it was Roan.

But because he had the Flamdor Mana Technique, he hadn’t separately trained it after understanding that there was no big problem to the mana technique itself.

‘It should be fine if it’s the Tale Mana Technique, right?’

Because it was a mana technique that exceedingly emphasized the basic of the basics, it could control all types of mana.

Of course, there was one worrisome problem.

That there was a chance that it could collide with the Flamdor Mana Technique if not careful.

‘But if it’s at a state like now when the heat is completely depleted……’

The possibility of collision was very slim.

But since there was something like perhaps, there was a need to be careful.

‘I don’t touch the inside of the mana hole.’

Roan gulped once, and visualized the mana hole.

When he focused on the surface of the mana hole, the water energy that had softly wrapped around it soon began to move little by little.

‘It’s working!’

At the very moment he was about to cheer at the mana that moved as he willed.

‘Hgh!’

Roan gasped back an empty air.

It was because the water energy within his body had explosively increased and completely filled his mana road.

No, it wasn’t only that.

As if the space within his body wasn’t enough, the water energy that had explosively expanded tried to even jet out of his body.

‘Kinis! Run!’

Roan hurriedly yelled towards Kinis.

Kinis too, befitting a water spirit, had already felt the abnormal phenomenon happening within Roan body.

She quickly moved below Roan’s feet and curled up her entire body.

As Kinis, who had checked them while shooting out balls of water, disappeared, the Kutiers extended sharp claws in front of them and leaped at Roan.

However, their desires couldn’t be achieved.

The very instant before Kutiers’ claws would rip apart Roan’s body.

Boooooom!

An incredible water energy exploded from Roan’s body.

The strength of the water energy was unbelievable.

Pbubububuk!

The Kutiers that were energetically attacking disappeared without a trace.

Not just at the level of exploding, they were completely erased.

It truly was an incredible power.

The at least one good point was that the energy didn’t extend towards above his head or below his feet thanks to Roan controlling the explosion’s direction until the end.

Thanks to that, the ships above the water’s surface and Kinis, who hid below his feet, could be safe.

[Ro, Roan. Your appearance……?]

Kinis looked around at the empty water where the Kutiers disappeared, then stared at Roan a moment late and made a shocked expression.

Roan.

His appearance right now was undoubtedly that of Ellaim.

Blue hair and a transparent skin.

Of course, it wasn’t a look as beautiful as her.

*****

“My lord! My lord!”

Harrison’s panicked voice echoed out.

“Shine the boat light!”

“Call the ships that retreated!”

The flagship arrived at the place Roan sank.

But however they shined the lights and shouted, Roan’s appearance wasn’t seen.

“The soldiers capable of diving step forwards!”

Harrison personally took off the on-water-use armor and stepped up for diving preparation.

The ones originally good at swimming and capable of diving amongst the soldiers hurriedly made preparations.

Their setup seemingly looked ready to dive into the lake at any moment.

But.

Boom!

With an explosive sound, one of the ships that were approaching towards the flagship sank.

Sethus, which had blasted away Roan, had already reached near them.

“Thousand-man commander!”

The soldiers turned to Harrison and hurriedly shouted.

Harrison, who was about to jump into the water to save Roan, gritted his teeth as he looked at Sethus.

‘Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!’

Curses rose back up all the way to his throat.

But if he became emotional, the soldiers below him would fall into panic.

Harrison forcefully calmed his heart that shook and gave an order.

“Prepare to attack with the arrows! All fleet hold back its legs!”

A miserable order.

The damage would be extreme.

But while the entire fleet stopped Sethus, he himself and the flagship’s soldiers planned to save Roan.

With the current situation, that was the best.

However, Sethus was much more powerful monster than Harrison’s thought.

Kwang! Kwakang!

At a swing or two of its arm, three ships were half demolished.

Tens, hundreds of arrows cut through the space and planted themselves into Sethus’ body, the monster didn’t show any reaction.

Roan, who had taken on the such gigantic bastard alone, newly felt amazing.

‘Damn it!’

Harrison was anxious.

He couldn’t stop Sethus, and he couldn’t save Roan either.

“Uaaaak!”

“Sa, save me!”

“Throw the ropes!”

“Save our allies!”

Hell.

All kinds of screams mixed and were heard.

Kuaaaaah!

With an aberrant scream, Sethus once again raised its arms up high.

Now, the thing the monster aimed for was the flagship.

Looking at the gigantic hand large enough to block out the night sky, Harrison bit his lips.

‘My lord……’

He wasn’t afraid of dying.

But, the fact he couldn’t save Roan felt lamentable.

Harrison grabbed the bow he hung on his back.

‘Even if I die a timely death, I will have to leave a single scratch on you bastard’s body.’

The bowstring was tightly pulled.

A single spindly arrow sharply trembled its body.

Kwaaaah!

With an aberrant scream once again, Sethus slowly swung the arm he had raised high.

It was a slow movement as if to make fun of the humans who would be crushed by its hand and die.

‘Even though you’re a mere monster!’

Harrison gritted his teeth and let go of the pulled bowstring.

Piing!

With a clear sound, a single arrow cut through the air.

It was an infinitely small and spindly thing compared to Sethus’ gigantic body.

‘Is this the best……’

Watching the arrow fly up, Harrison spat out a long sigh.

At that moment.

Booooooooom!

With an explosive sound, a column of water soared up next to the flagship.

“Huhugh!”

“Wha, what the!”

“Is it a monster again!”

The soldiers loudly shouted and stared at the column of water.

The column of water was truly grand.

It endlessly soared up.

Kwah?

Sethus too, at the sudden situation, blinked its eyes and glared at the column of water.

Shwaak!

Suddenly, an incredible stream of water extended out from the column of water.

Drawing a long curve, it hit the Sethus’ arm that was raised up high.

No, the stream of water that they thought had hit Sethus’ arm directly passed through it.

It was a strange sight.

Kwah?

Sethus too, once again, shouted out a strange and aberrant scream.

That moment.

Paaaaaat!

Following Sethus’ arm, an incredible fountain of blood soared up.

At the same time, the arm that was attached to the gigantic body slowly become disjointed and then fell on top of the lake.

Kwaaaaang!

With an incredible splash of water, a swell of water arose.

The flagship and the ships greatly swayed.

Kwaaaah!

Looking at arm that was cleanly cut off, Sethus exploded out a horrendous scream.

On the other hand, the Tale Legion’s soldiers, at the situation that suddenly happened, became mutes who ate honey. 1

At that moment, a soldier from the flagship shouted.

“It, it’s the lord!”

The end of his finger pointed at the column of water.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards the end of the column of water.

“Ah……”

With a greatly moved look, Harrison let out a quiet exclamation.

He was there.

The man proudly standing at the end of the column of water and glaring at Sethus was definitely Roan.

Although both the color of the hair and skin was different than before, he could clearly recognize him.

“My lord……”

For some reason, tears flowed.

Roan whom he thought was dead.

He had soar up riding the column of water and then had cut off Sethus’ gigantic arm.

At that moment, Roan pointed at Sethus with the Travias Spear.

The soldiers, while staying mute, looked at that sight.

A thundering roar exploded out as if it had been waiting.

“Sethus! You bitch! Who told you to touch my guys?”

Who told you to touch my guys.

They were words they really heard a lot somewhere.

Poskein Subjugation End.

Translator Note:

So… I’m not sure how to say this well, but firstly, I’m sorry. I’ll be changing the IatM’s release schedule to 2 chapters per week.

In all honesty, I’ve actually spent the last three months constantly translating and hadn’t done anything else besides small chores and family activities. And with the average length of chapters slowly increasing, I had too much problem trying to be on time and it doesn’t look like I’ll be able to get out those sponsored chapters anytime soon.

The bottom line is, I need more time to spend on my studying (as a college student, I really do need to study a bit more), so I’ll be reducing the releases to one chapter each on Tuesday and Saturday. I’m sorry.

Chapter 158




T/n: Late chapter for Tuesday. Sorry. Next chapter will be up on Saturday.

“We have to immediately dispatch a messenger. A fief war at a time like this! This is ridiculous!”

First Prince Simon Rinse shouted with a brightly flushed face.

For once after a long while, he was currently pouring out his rage to his heart’s content.

However, the thing that instead shot out from the opposite side was a sharp and cold smile.

“Older brother. Can you really say such words even after listening to the report? The ones who first attacked the fief is the Count Lancephil Forces. The Count Chase Forces has merely invoke its right to self defense.”

Snickering lips.

The owner of the annoying and provocative voice was the Second Prince Tommy Rinse.

At the urgent message that flew from the kingdom’s Northeast, Rinse Kingdom’s three princes and the nobles had hurriedly sought the palace grand hall.

An outbreak of a fief war between Lancephil County versus Chase County.

Rinse Kingdom had ended a large scale war and a subjugation, and had just began to calm its breath.

Each fief were focusing on healing the damage and exhaustion that had piled up until now.

Thanks to that, the Rinse Kingdom was maintaining a precarious state of peace even in the middle of the throne succession competition.

However.

‘The entire kingdom should shake once again with this fief war.’

‘Count Lancephil versus Count Chase……’

‘Prince Simon versus Prince Tommy, no is it a battle of Prince Simon versus the other two princes?’

The fief war at the current situation wasn’t at a level of power struggle between nobles.

‘The one who wins this fief war can walk ahead in the throne succession competition.’

If Count Io Lancephil won, the throne succession competition would become Simon’s solo landslide.

On the reverse, if Count Jonathan Chase won, Tommy and Kallum, who had fallen behind a bit, would gain strength once again.

“We have to immediately stop the fief war!”

Simon glared once at Tommy, then shouted towards the nobles.

“That is correct! A fief war at a time like this……”

“Lancephil County and Chase County are major border regions. If a fief war breaks out at a place like that, an enormous hole will be created in the border defense.”

“We cannot respond properly if the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom invade.”

The nobles who followed Simon pour out words of support at the top of their voices.

But.

“Firstly, let us clearly go over this once more. According to the messenger’s report, the one who first attacked the fief was the Count Lancephil Forces. The cause of the outbreak of this fief war is in Lancephil County. We acknowledge that point, no?”

“Hhm.”

At Tommy’s words, the nobles who supported Simon all swallowed back coughs with uncomfortable looks.

‘Why would Sir Count Lancephil commit such a foolish thing?’

‘Conspiracy. This is definitely a conspiracy.’

‘Sir Count Lancephil isn’t a man who would commit such an act.’

Count Io Lancephil was a noble who loved the kingdom more than anyone.

He wasn’t a man to start a trouble first because of trifle things.

But however it was, it was true that the Count Lancephil Forces had attacked Chase County first when they only looked at the objective facts revealed until now.

“Chase County has invoked its right to self defense to protect itself, and are taking the momentum to push back the Count Lancephil Forces who are the invaders. Furthermore, the Count Chase House and the Count Lancephil House have been rivals for generations, and the aged emotions between the two houses aren’t a kind that other people can understand. The Count Lancephil Forces attacking Chase County too is……”

For a while, Tommy explained his thoughts on the current fief war with a clear and definite voice.

Stepping up to the center of the grand hall, he looked straight at Simon.

“I will repeat, the one who first started this event was Lancephil County. At a situation like this, to order a withdraw to Chase County is highly unreasonable. Leaving the assailant and scolding the victim isn’t something very nice to look at. Isn’t that right, older brother?”

As expected, his voice was annoying and provocative.

Simon sharply trembled his entire body while clenching his fists.

He wished to throw a punch and break Tommy’s jawbone at any moment.

But then, everything would end.

It was certain that the nobles who supported Tommy and Kallum would flock up like a swarm of bees.

‘If not careful, I could be dropped from not only this fief war problem but also the throne succession competition.’

Barely pressing down on the anger that rose up to his throat, Simon exhaled a long sigh.

“Tommy. There is also truth to your words. But the two counties are located at major border region. If we just leave the fief war alone, a large hole will be created in the border defense.”

At those words, the Third Prince Kallum Rinse, who had been standing at the back, walked forwards.

“Older brother. Please don’t worry about that. We just need to send a fast message to the Northern Regional Corp and the Eastern Regional Corp to make full defensive preparations. Furthermore, the Istel Kingdom and the Byron Kingdom currently aren’t in a situation to invade our kingdom.”

It was true.

In domestic situation, the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom were more appalling than the Rinse Kingdom.

“Hhm.”

Simon thinly opened his eyes and glared at Tommy and Kallum.

‘So they will join together.’

It was something he had expected ever since he first heard the news of the fief war’s outbreak.

‘No, the fief war itself may perhaps be those guys’ work.’

Simon gritted his teeth.

He turned his head and stared at Duke Bradley Webster.

The man who was one of the four dukes of the Rinse Kingdom and maternal grandfather.

But for some reason, Bradley shook his head as soon as he met Simon’s eyes.

Clearly, it was a gesture to stop and step back.

‘Why……?’

Even amongst the nobles who supported Simon, Io was on the side of those of large power.

It was a situation where if he lost at this fief war, Simon’s base could shake greatly.

Simon, with eyes full of disbelief, stared at Bradley.

At that moment, Bradley stepped forwards with a short sigh.

“I have heard well of Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum’s words.”

The four duke houses were one of the great columns that supported the Rinse Kingdom.

The weight of Bradley’s statements were different than the statements of ordinary nobles.

Naturally, everyone’s gazes headed towards him.

“But even so, we cannot just merely watch. I believe it would be good to limit the length of the fief war to one month and disallow the participation of other fiefs excluding the Lancephil County and the Chase County.”

“Sir Duke Webster!”

Simon shouted as he creased his brows.

Bradley shook his head with a solidly stiffen expression

It meant not to step up any further.

“Kuk.”

Although Simon was the First Prince of the kingdom, he couldn’t thoughtlessly cling to him and protest.

With a completely flushed face, he could only close his mouth.

‘Just what is he thinking……’

When Simon stepped back, Bradley slowly looked around at Tommy and Kallum as well as many nobles and asked.

“How is my proposal?”

Unlike the soft voice, the light in his eyes were glaringly shining.

A light seemingly telling them to concede at an adequate level since I have also stepped back this much.

Tommy and Kallum’s eyes moved rapidly.

Duke Edwin Voisa and Duke Liss Kowan subtly nodded their heads.

‘It is fine with this much.’

‘The situation is more advantageous to us.’

Their intentions were passed through the light in their eyes.

Tommy and Kallum faintly smiled and nodded their heads.

“As expected, I could only clap at Sir Duke Webster’s insight.”

“Since fief wars like this are something that are common. As long as it doesn’t escalate, it doesn’t seem that there is anything that will particularly become a problem.”

The two people’s smiles tinged with a cold light.

Already, they knew of the inside story set behind the current fief war.

‘Duke Webster. It seems that he is trying to put a brake ahead of time in case me and Kallum join hands and aid Count Chase, but……’

‘How tragic. Even though Count Lancephil has collapsed from the inside. Kuk.’

Laughters kept leaking out.

When they thought that Simon and Bradley didn’t know anything, their mood naturally become good.

Bradley, knowing or perhaps not knowing the two people’s such inner thoughts, faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

“Then, I will organize the content we agreed on and report to his majesty the king.”

He tried to hurriedly clean up the meeting.

Simon still had an expression that said it was hard to understand, and Tommy and Kallum’s expressions were those of forcefully holding back laughters.

Looking at the sight of the three princes, Bradley slightly shook his head.

‘Huh…… they are all still young.’

An unknown and peculiar smile appeared on his mouth.

That was a truly guileful smile.

*****

Kuaaaa!

A hideous scream exploded out.

That was rather closer to a wail.

“No, no way.”

“Is, is he really the lord?”

“Sethus isn’t able to do anything!”

The expressions of Tale Legion’s soldiers were half dazed out of their minds.

They were staring at Roan, who had rode the column of water and soared up.

Shwaaak!

Each time the Travias Spear moved once, a jet of water cut through the space.

Following the complex and beautiful line of the spear, a great spray of water rose.

And each time, Sethus’ solid body split straight apart and crimson blood sprouted out.

‘To think the power that the essence of water has is this much.’

Roan, who was fluttering blue hair and pressuring Sethus, was inwardly being greatly shocked.

It was because the power that the essence of water, the water energy, that was wrapped around the surface of the mana hole was much greater than he had imagined.

‘If only there was a powerful mana technique like the Flamdor Mana Technique……’

He would have shown a might several times more powerful than now.

When his thoughts reached about that point, a bitter smile hung on Roan’s mouth.

‘Flamdor Mana Technique is strong but the heat I could actually use is scarce, and the water energy is truly plenty but actually has no mana technique that could properly utilize it.’

The heat and the water energy.

The two were both still at half-done states.

Of course, even so.

‘It’s this strong!’

Roan gritted his teeth and thrusted the Travias Spear forwards.

Suddenly, an amazingly large stream of water formed a shape of a sharp spearhead and flew towards Sethus.

Kueng!

With a horrible scream, Sethus violently swung the one arm that was left.

But.

Puuk!

The spearhead-shaped stream of water directly pierced through its arm and stabbed into its body.

Ssskuk!

The steam of water that penetrated all the way to a deep place within its body soon lightly disappeared and hid its trace.

Kuaaaah!

Sethus wailed and shrieked as it looked at the widely perforated arm.

Roan prepared the final strike as he watched that sight.

‘I want to torment it more if I could, but……’

In truth, he too wasn’t quite full of leisure.

After he had soared up out of the lake, heat kept coming in and filled the mana hole that had been empty.

‘It becomes hard to control the water energy the more the heat fills in.’

Not only that, the power too was drastically decreasing.

‘So I still can’t control both energies together at once with my skill.’

Although he felt regretful, he had no plan of being greedy.

Because the heat and the water energy may collide and rampage while forcefully trying to control the two energies.

‘I will go slowly.’

There still was a lot of time.

‘For now, let’s take care of this bastard.’

With his teeth gritted, Roan twisted his wrists.

The Travias Spear tightly clung to his side.

A stream of water soared following the spear’s shaft and the spearhead.

It literally was the final strike.

There was no need to leave any water energy within his body..

Paaaat!

Incredible water energy whirled with Roan as the center.

The hair that was colored with a blue light slowly returned to its original color.

The skin that was transparent also found its own color.

[Roan.]

Kinis, who had grown as much as a little girl, also shrunk to a size of a palm.

The one thing that was at least good was that her form was still clearly visible.

‘Sorry. For making you become small again.’

[It’s fine. For now, this is more comfortable. Since it was also hard for me to adapt because I suddenly grew so big.]

Kinis forcefully smiled brightly and flew onto the top of Roan’s head.

Roan slightly nodded his head instead of an answer, then glared at Sethus.

“Let’s finish already.”

He briefly threw those words.

Kuaaah!

Sethus answered with an unintelligible and terrible shriek.

Breathing in deeply, Roan directly thrusted the spear.

The water energy that was whirling around his entire body rode the stream of water and flew towards Sethus.

Shwaaaak!

The stream of water cut and tore through space.

Sethus glared at the stream of water flying towards him and fully opened its gigantic mouth.

Kuah!

With a horrible sound, a jet of water of an incredible size spew out.

That was much bigger and thicker than the stream of water that Roan had shot.

“Ah……”

“No!”

The Tale Legion’s soldiers, who had been watching, exploded out regretful exclamations.

It seemed as if Sethus’ stream would eat up Roan’s stream.

To that much degree, there was a clear difference between the two streams.

However, Roan didn’t even blink an eye.

‘I believe it.’

He believed the power of the essence of water, the water energy, that he was carrying.

Kinis too, with a confident expression, stayed on top of Roan’s head.

And finally.

Booooom!

Roan’s stream and Sethus’ jet collided.

With a sound of explosion, a great wave of water sprayed everywhere.

“Kuuk.”

“Ugh!”

At the wave of water that hit their entire bodies, the Tale Legion’s soldiers gritted their teeths.

Boom!

An explosion rang out once again.

The soldiers thought that Roan’s stream was eaten up by the incredible jet of water.

But.

Kuaaah!

The one that panicked was Sethus.

The monster saw Roan’s stream that was insignificantly small piercing through its jet of water and slowly approaching.

Kuaaah!

Sethus struggled with its entire strength and sprout out a jet of water once again.

But even so, it couldn’t stop Roan’s stream.

Almost like a strong salmon, Roan’s stream of water climbed up against Sethus’ jet.

Kuaah!

Sethus threw up a monstrous scream at the end.

That was a wail mixed with despair and fear.

Simultaneously.

Puung!

With an amazing sound of explosion, Sethus’ head exploded out.

Shwaaak!

With a great spray of water, the spouted blood thickly spread like a fog.

“Uugh!”

“Wugh!”

Few soldiers couldn’t endure the thick smell of blood and vomited.

Kukukukukukung.

Meanwhile, Sethus, which had been standing straight up, leaned diagonally and slowly fell.

An incredible swell hit the ships.

“Kuk!”

“Grab the safety ropes!”

Panicked voices echoed from here and there.

But even during that while, Harrison raced to the forecastle.

Towards the place Roan was standing until just now, he yelled at the top of his throat.

“My lord! My lord!”

An anguished voice shook the thick spray of water.

Soon following that, even the other soldiers swarmed up to the edges of the deck.

“My lord! My lord!”

“Turn on the boat light!”

“Show him our location!”

Hurried sounds filled the space between the ships.

As the heartrending sounds kept continuing on, several soldiers cried out in tears.

“Hhgh. My lord.”

“Hhhugh. Hhg.”

At that moment.

“I’m not dead so stop crying.”

A familiar voice was heard from the center deck mast.

A soft but powerful voice.

It was definitely Roan’s voice.

The flagship’s soldiers, including Harrison, all rushed towards the center of the deck.

Ssssss.

At the mast that wasn’t even very visible due to the spray.

From above it, a black human silhouette was coming down towards the deck.

Tap.

A soft landing movement.

The man who appeared with a faint smile was Roan.

The blue colored hair and the transparent skin had regained their original colors.

“My, my lord!”

“My lord! Are you hurt anywhere?”

Starting with Harrison, the soldiers ran towards Roan.

Roan brightly smiled as he shrugged.

“I’m fine. Rather than that, first……”

Staring at Sethus’ corpse bulging up above the lake, he formed a strange smile.

“There is something we have to do.”

“Something we have to do, sir?”

Harrison asked with brightly red eyes.

Roan slightly nodded his head and spoke in a quiet voice.

“There’s one rumor I heard since a long time ago, and……”

The smile hanging on his mouth became much thicker.

“I plan to test it.”

His expression and voice were weighty.

Harrison and the soldiers unknowingly followed Roan’s gaze and stared at Sethus’ carcass.

That almost brought to mind a small island in the lake.

Vvuuuuu!

Soon, a sound of horn signalling advance echoed out with the flagship as the center.

Shwaaak!

Soon, tens of ships crossed the water’s surface and began to move.

Their target was Sethus’ carcass.

Their goal?

Only Roan knew it yet.

Fief War (1) End.

Chapter 159




T/n: Sorry about the lateness. Kajin became busy with IRL work, and I had to find a new PR. For now, Kerrigan will be helping out IatM until st8_lupe comes back from his vacation.

Update: ch. 160 will be a bit late. I can’t seem to be able to contact Kerrigan, and I may have to find a new temporary PR.

In the last life, the first person to take down Sethus was the pirate king Beck.

No, the only man to have taken down Sethus was Beck.

Although there were more than plenty of people stronger than Beck on land, Beck was the strongest man at least on the Poskein Lake.

‘Since even besides his individual strength, he also had the support of the mermaids.’

Anyhow, after taking down Sethus, which was categorized as an upper echelon even amongst the Poskein Lake’s monsters, Beck dissected its body into pieces.

The reason?

‘There is an oil sac within the monster’s body.’

Sethus secreted a peculiar-smelling oil when seducing its mate, and this was the very Sethus oil.

‘If one covered the ships, armor, and clothes in that oil, the monsters categorized under lower echelon of the Poskein Lake will run far away just from smelling the odor.’

The Sethus oil was stored in an oil sac deep inside its body, and as much as its gigantic sized body, the oil sac also boasted an amazingly great size.

Enough for all the Tale Legion’s ships and soldiers to use and have left overs.

Not only that.

‘Sethus’ crimson blood has the effect of stopping the approach of other Sethus.’

The predator of the Poskein Lake Sethus instinctively had a strong repulsion towards its own blood.

‘These were the very rumors that I had heard.’

No, to be exact, it could be called information.

‘Since Beck actually became a pirate king with the ships and armor washed in Sethus’ oil and blood. Of course, he did receive the mermaids’ help.’

The problem was after that.

After completely seizing the Poskein Lake, Beck had committed atrocities that were incredible enough to be almost unimaginable.

Levying tolls to the merchant ships travelling the lake was understandable.

But depending on his mood, he even seized or sank the ships that were travelling.

Not only that, he had raided the villages on the lakeside, plundered their properties, and killed the people as he wished.

The four nations bordering the Poskein Lake had tried to fight against Beck’s such tyranny, but there was no way to fight him, who had settled himself at a place deep in the Poskein Lake.

‘One of the reasons I’m trying to subjugate and conquer the Poskein Lake first.’

If he were to conquer the Poskein Lake, Roan planned to only collect appropriate tolls and usage fees.

‘Of course, there isn’t only economic reason like that.’

The biggest reason he was hurrying to subjugate and conquer the Poskein Lake.

‘The damage from the monsters is severe.’

Although the cases of monsters carrying out large-scale land invasion like the Poskein Exodus weren’t something that happened often, cases of large and small villages being attacked were happening frequently.

Furthermore, in case of few terrestrial monsters, there even were research results that said their roots were in the Poskein Lake.

‘At least for the lakeside villages’ safety and the residents’ peaceful lives, Poskein subjugation is necessary at any cost.’

Although it was an immensely anthropocentric thought, it was a natural decision to the human Roan.

Since Poskein Lake’s monsters too were attacking the human villages on the lakeside on their own decision.

‘On top of that, there just was a need for a situation to sound out Kali Owells’ plan.’

The Poskein Lake Subjugation was utilized even as a part of the stratagem to reveal Kali’s black intentions. Since he would definitely move if a vacuum of power appeared.

Like that, the subjugation had arose with numerous schemes as the background.

“Soak the sail and the mast, forecastle and the stern with Sethus’ blood!”

“Soak also the helmets and armors thoroughly!”

The commanders of and above the thousand-man commander rank ordered the soldiers.

Even the Tale Legion’s soldiers, who instantly reacted to any order, hesitated a bit at least at this moment.

Bathing the armor in the blood a monster had bled was simply disagreeable.

At that moment, the one stepped up was in fact Roan.

Taking the lead and setting an example, he plunged his helmet and armor into Sethus’ blood.

“Ah……”

Seeing that sight, the soldiers hid their looks of hesitation, took off their helmets and armor, and thickly plastered Sethus’ blood in ones and twos.

Splash. Splash.

From here and there noisily echoed the sound of plunging armors into the crimson blood.

The sticky yet metallic-smelling blood began to color the armors and the ships red.

The alchemists and the engineers who had boarded along, just in case there might be a need for it later, were bottling the Sethus’ blood fully in empty wooden caskets and loading them.

‘Right. Since who knows if there is another effect to Sethus’ blood.’

It wasn’t as if Roan knew everything.

He especially and greatly lacked technical knowledge.

‘The alchemy department and the engineering department should take care of it well.’

If even the Reno Magic Tower were to assist the research, they should be able to gain a greater result.

If possible, he wished that there was a mana enhancement property to Sethus’ blood and oil, no, at least in its chunks of flesh.

‘Is it an overly excessive expectation?’

He pointlessly felt embarrassed and smiled.

At that moment.

“We found it!”

“We found the oil sac, sir!”

The soldiers who had been digging through Sethus’ body shouted aloud.

Roan quickly kicked off the stern and climbed up onto Sethus’ body.

When he claw through and entered into the crimson body, he saw the oil sac of an incredible size.

“Like how we rubbed on the Sethus’ blood, thoroughly plaster the oil too on the ships and the armors.”

“Yes. Understood!”

The commanders and the soldiers answered in one voice.

Soon, with the Roan at the lead and starting with the commanders as an example, they covered Sethus’ oil onto their entire armor.

Following after that, the soldiers continued on the work of rubbing the oil.

As expected, the amount of oil was plenty.

Not only once but over two, three times, the Tale Legion’s soldiers meticulously rubbed on the oil again and again.

In that time, the darkness went away and the sun rose.

But even so, the oil rubbing work continued on.

The sun set once again and the darkness fell onto the surroundings.

Perhaps thanks to Sethus’ crimson blood and oil, there wasn’t even a single monster that attacked the legion.

“We have completed everything, sir.”

Austin reported.

With Sethus’ crimson blood and oil, the ships and the soldiers were newly born.

The world was completely red.

If the Istel Kingdom’s soldiers saw that sight, they would have trembled in shock saying it’s the Crimson Ghost’s army.

A crimson legion.

Like that, the legion of fear that would later shake and thrill the world began.

“Bottle the remaining blood and oil into wooden casks and load as much as possible.”

“Yes! Understood!”

Soon, the work continued.

However, the amount of blood and oil was much too great compared to the amount that could be loaded.

Sethus was that gigantic.

‘It’s regrettable, but can’t be helped.’

If he could, he would have liked to tie Sethus’ body to a ship and haul it, but it was simply too big so they couldn’t.

Putting the regrettable feeling behind him, Roan called together the thousand-man rank commanders.

“Since we have covered the armors and ships with Sethus’ blood and oil, the lower echelon monsters won’t be able to even dare to approach.”

At those words, numerous thousand-man commanders clenched their fists tight.

“It became no different than attaching a wing to Poskein Lake Subjugation.”

“Subjugation of lake’s northern region shouldn’t have any problem.”

“Let us immediately advance to the Exos Island.”

Their voices were confident and energetic.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“One should row when the tide comes in.”

With this opportunity, he planned to advance to the Exos Island and build a military port.

But even so, it wasn’t a situation where he could lead the entire legion and advance.

Roan looked at Semi.

“Three-thousand-man commander Semi will take ten ships and subjugate the lake’s northern region.”

“Yes. Understood!”

Semi instantly saluted as he answered.

The rest of the commanders, as if asking what he meant, stared at Roan with blank expressions.

Roan faintly smiled as he looked at them.

“The rest will return to the fief.”

The instant he said those words.

“Eh?”

“We’re going back?”

Several thousand-man commanders asked back with surprised expressions.

They couldn’t understand returning to the fief when they had just seized the chance to victory.

But Austin and the core commanders, who already knew the meaning behind the Poskein Lake Subjugation before marching, slowly nodded their heads.

Roan turned his head and stared towards the north.

“By now, the north should have become very noisy.”

As he had expected, currently, the Lancephil County located north of the Tale Barony was greatly noisy.

No, it wasn’t at a level of being noisy.

It was literally a scene of hell.

That day, Roan left ten ships and headed towards the Nuperu village, the port they sailed from, under the cover of darkness.

A dark night when even the moonlight hid.

Tens of crimson boats and soldiers slowly moved north.

*****

“I am the captain of the Tale Barony Northern Road Troop 1st Castle Hughes. Sir Count Lancephil. We welcome you to the Tale Barony.”

A man who seemed to have just entered his thirties saluted in front of a wide open castle gate.

The troop that was approaching with the Count Lancephil House’s flag at the lead stopped their motion.

They were the transferred troops to the Tale Barony that Count Io Lancephil had promised before.

Soon, the soldiers split to the sides and haggard-looking Count Io Lancephil appeared.

“Northern Road Troop 1st Castle?”

Io cautiously asked as he climbed down from his horse.

The man who had been saluting, Hughes, faintly smiled as he answered.

“We cannot tell you exactly because it’s a military secret, but in the case of Tale Barony, we have divided our defense forces and are managing them as five separate troops. The Northern Road Troop is the troop defending the fief’s northern border and is stationed with twelve big and small forts at the center. I am responsible for managing the 1st Castle amongst those.”

It was a straight and powerful enough pose that was almost hard to see as from a commander of a commoner background.

“Hmm.”

Io nodded his head with a slightly surprised expression.

He knew that Roan was developing an elite troop with the Tale Legion as a base, but he didn’t know that he possibly had separately put side a defense force and was firmly defending the fief.

‘And to think there are twelve forts like this just on the fief’s northern border……’

Suddenly, he remembered Kali Owells’ past report.

‘He said that we need to warn and guard against Roan since he had built forts and has stationed troops at places close to our fief.’

For some reason, a bitter smile came out.

‘Has telling him not to mind at the time instead help me?’

He hadn’t quite knew that the situation would become like this.

With a short sigh, Io shook his head and looked at Hughes.

“Could you tell me the state of our fief?”

“I will answer you that, sir.”

Pushing aside the soldiers lined up behind Hughes, the president Chris of Agens showed himself.

His expression wasn’t very bright.

“For now, let us move the location.”

At Chris’ words, Io nodded his head.

With a little tired look, he moved his feet and briefly asked.

“As expected, it isn’t good, no?”

His words asked of the state of the war.

Chris bitterly smiled and nodded his head.

“Already, most of the west have went over to Count Chase Forces’ hands. Of the detailed stories……”

He lightly glanced at the Count Lancephil Troops lined up behind them, then spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“I will tell you inside.”

His voice was heavy.

As much as that, Io’s expression too turned solid stiff.

“Huu.”

A sigh holding heavy regrets extended out long.

*****

“Idiotic bastard!”

Kali Owells kicked over the table in front of him and shouted.

The commanders who were sitting together with him were abruptly surprised and stood up from their seat.

It was the first time that Kali became this much angry.

‘Even though he was always cool-headed.’

‘Well, this event is hard to tolerate.’

‘Stupid Perry Wilson.’

The commanders searched Kali’s mood and cursed the Lancephil Fief Regiment Captain Perry Wilson.

Boom!

Kali kicked aside the table once again.

The table shattered into pieces and they couldn’t even guess its old look.

But Kali didn’t shout nor show a look of jumping around in fit like before.

In that short moment, Kali was already regaining his composure.

He threw himself down onto his seat and glared at the opposite side.

The messenger of the Fief Regiment Captain Perry Wilson.

The young man, who looked to be just now about mid twenties, was lowering his head with a completely nervous expression.

“So, Io Lancephil’s current location is?”

Kali asked with a quietly subdued voice.

The messenger dryly gulped once and then answered.

“We sent a pursuit troop but it was already too late. Sir Count Lancephil has, no, Io Lancephil has entered the Tale Barony.”

The end of his voice shook.

“Huu.”

Controlling the rage that boiled up, Kali spat out a long sigh.

‘Perry Wilson. You stupid and conceited man. You finally ruined the work.’

It wasn’t even as if he had asked for a difficult work.

‘Even though I merely told him to carefully monitor Io.’

Perry was overflowing with confidence.

No, his conceit was excessive.

In the end, that conceited attitude had ruined the work.

When Kali was subjugating the western region of the Lancephil County together with Count Chase Forces, Perry Wilson’s messenger arrived.

The news the messenger brought was Io Lancephil’s escape.

Uddk.

The teeth naturally gritted.

‘Io Lancephil. If I can’t catch that old man, the work won’t end even if I conquer the Lancephil County.’

If Io, who survived, continued to call himself the owner of the fief, only Kali’s position would become vague.

‘Damn it!’

Curses pushed up to his throat.

But it wasn’t as if the work would be solved just because he mindlessly raged.

‘I need to find a way. A way……’

With his eyes closed, Kali rolled his mind.

Tens, hundreds of bizarre, extravagant, and complicated plans repeated to arise and be estranged.

After an unknown amount of time.

Gulp.

The commanders who were sitting together with him were merely watching Kali’s mood.

At that moment.

Flash!

Kali opened the eyes he had closed and looked at the magic corp head Tairon Bess.

“Baron Bess. Immediately take a part of the magic corp and a part of the knight order and go to the Lemy Region.”

“Le…… my Region you say?”

Tairon creased his brows.

Even within the Lancephil County, the Lemy Region was a very remote countryside region located in the north.

Although it was known as a place where the scenery was good, it wasn’t a place where the number of residents were great since it was a place too close to the Byron Kingdom.

It wasn’t a place where they would go out of their way to lead the members of the magic corp and the knights to find in such situation.

Kali slowly nodded his head.

With a meaningful expression, he spoke as if to whisper.

“There is a bait there that could lure out Io.”

“A bait that could lure out Io?”

Tairon unknowingly asked back in a quiet voice.

Kali looked around at everyone and answered shortly.

“Lemy Region is where the last head of the knight order and Io Lancephil’s old friend, Albert Wein retired.”

A cold killing intent hung on his voice.

“Capture and bring him here.”

If it’s Albert Wein, he should become an excellent bait.

The tips of Kali’s mouth slowly went up.

It was a horrifying smile.

‘Io. Will you be able to endure and stand?’

Could he simply watch his friend’s neck be cut?

Kali shook his head.

‘He will definitely come to rescue him.’

He was certain.

‘Since that’s exactly Io.’

Kali had the confidence to catch a big fish with a one old bait.

A big fish called Io.

Chapter 160




T/n: So ultimately, I couldn’t contact Kerrigan and had to ask another PR, Sai101, to proofread the chapter. Sorry about the lateness.

Note: “fief troop” has been changed to “fief regiment”. Additionally, “Count Lancephil Troop”, “Owells Troop”, and “Count Chase Troop” have been changed to “Count Lancephil Forces”, “Owells Forces”, and “Count Chase Forces”.

Fishing didn’t always succeed just because the bait and the skill were good.

With a solidly stiffen face, Kali shook his head.

“You definitely said that you spread the rumors, right?”

At those words, one of the Owells Forces’ commanders stood up from his seat.

“Yes. Io Lancephil too should definitely have heard of Albert Wein’s news.”

“And there’s no reaction at all even so?”

Kali gritted his teeth.

The commander nodded his head.

“Yes sir. There is no reaction at all from the 1st Castle where Io is cooped up in.”

“Hmm.”

At the report that continued on, Kali swallowed back a groan.

‘It seems that I thought too lightly of that old man.’

He thought that if it was Albert, whom roamed the battlefields together with Io for tens of years, it would be more than enough to lure out Io.

But this was Kali’s complete misjudgment.

“If it was at a level of returning because of a single retainer, he wouldn’t have ran in the first place.”

The head of the Magic Corp, Tairon Bess, spoke in a slightly low voice.

With a sinister expression, he continued to speak.

“Rather than that, instead……”

“Instead……?”

Kali squinted one eye and waited Tairon’s next words.

Tairon quickly glanced through the surrounding commanders’ faces and then spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Why don’t we break the things Io loves the most?”

“The things Io loves?”

Several commanders asked with puzzled looks.

Tairon formed a frightening smile and answered.

“I’m talking about the fief’s citizens.”

“Ah……”

Quiet exclamations popped out from here and there.

Few, with faint smiles, nodded their heads.

‘Right. The things Io loved the most are the fief’s citizens.’

‘Since he was to a degree of enjoying inspecting the castle city even on normal days.’

But.

“We don’t only have the goal of merely conquering Lancephil County. We must take this place as a fief and build a base.”

Kali continued to speak with a worried expression.

“It means that we could face a great difficulty at a later date if we treat the fief’s citizens carelessly.”

At those words, Tairon snorted out a laugh.

“Why would you say something so alike Io? Since when did we began watch the lowly fief’s citizens’ moods?”

At the sharp words, Kali slightly flinched.

Tairon smacked his lips and nodded his head.

“Smack1. If it’s that worrying, we can disguise as Count Chase Forces and cut down the citizens. No, it should be better to do it like that. Since if Count Chase Forces’ infamy becomes high within the fief, it would become a big advantage when competing with them over the fief’s administration in the future.”

Literally two birds with one stone.

It was a plan that could simultaneously plant the infamy of the Count Chase Forces, whom are the invaders, into the fief’s citizens and drag out Io.

Kali slowly nodded his head.

“It’s not bad.”

No, in truth, he very much liked it.

The next plans flooded into his head.

“There are bastards who are currently blocking our advance, right?”

At the inquiring words, the commanders lowered their heads.

“Yes. It seems several village residents have came together and formed a militia.”

Suddenly, a frightening killing intent hung on Kali’s eyes.

“Capture them as well as all of their families. Execute them as an example.”

“Yes. Understood.”

The commanders answered in one voice and then went out of the barrack.

Kali and Tairon watched that sight and made faint smiles.

‘Io. Will you truly be able to endure even this?’

They couldn’t catch a big fish with a single good bait.

This time, they planned to lay tens, hundreds of baits at the same time.

So that even a big fish with however strong a patience would ultimately can only open its mouth.

Kali’s smile became much deeper.

‘The fishing hasn’t ended yet.’

*****

“It seems there are many excellent talents in Lancephil County, sir.”

Chris shifted through various reports and honestly exclaimed in awe.

Count Io Lancephil, who sat on the opposite side, made a bitter smile.

“Everyone is all working hard because of this foolish old man.”

A long sigh flowed out.

In truth, he had predicted that Lancephil County would soon fall into Count Chase Forces’ hands through Kali Owells, Tairon Bess, Perry Wilson and so on’s betrayal.

But Agens and Tenebra Troop’s reports that rapidly arrived more than overturned that prediction.

“Currently, a front line was created with the Lancephil County’s northeast as the center.”

“They said Guardian Army, no?”

“Yes, sir. They called themselves the Lancephil Guardian Army. They are made up of academy students and ordinary commoners.”

Chris answered with a careful voice.

He lifted the report and added on.

“Beside that, few knights, mages, and Fief Regiment soldiers who didn’t join Owells Forces are included.”

“Hohoho.”

It was a proud yet dispirited laughter.

Io’s face expression was truly complicated and delicate.

‘So I haven’t merely lived in vain even so.’

When he realized the truth that the fief’s citizens are fighting with their lives on the line for him, one side of his heart was moved.

“But Kali and Jonathan Chase’s Forces are elites amongst the elites. It won’t be easy for ordinary commoners to face them.”

His voice naturally rubbed out with sadness.

At Io’s words, Chris, with a short sigh, nodded his head.

“Yes. It seems that quite a many citizens have lost their lives already. But despite so, the number of citizens joining the Guardian Army isn’t going down. No, I should say that it’s increasing instead, sir.”

Chris shook his head with a very surprised expression.

At the situation that he was proud yet was unable to simply be happy of, Io’s heart felt pained.

Chris searched Io’s expression and added on.

“Anyhow, due to the Guardian Army’s actions, Owells Forces and the Count Chase Forces has not been able to advance toward the east and northeast regions even after conquering the Pavor Castle.”

“Could they hold on until the end of the fief war’s time limit that the capital has decided on?”

At Io’s inquiry, Chris contemplated for a moment, then slowly shook his head.

“They will fall before that. Since the difference in strength is so big. But……”

Chris hesitated for a moment, then continued his words with a quiet voice.

“With the Guardian Army’s actions, we should be able to cut down a large part of Owells Forces and Count Chase Forces’ strength. This will become a big aid when Sir Count steps out for counterattack in the future.”

It was a cold but exact judgment.

With a long sigh, Io shook his head.

“They are spilling too much blood because of me. The people who don’t need to die are dying.”

His heart felt heavy.

Even without that, when he heard the news that his friend and comrade Albert Wein was captured in Kali’s hands, his heart wanted to immediately run to him.

‘I had stayed since Chris stubbornly stopped me, but……’

Because it felt that more and more of fief’s citizens were dying as the fief war continued, he couldn’t stop the pained feeling.

Chris noticed that inner feeling.

“Sir Count. As long as Sir Count is alive, Lancephil County can stand up again at any time. Please see the situation longer, and much wider.”

“Yes. That is so, but……”

Even though he knew through his head, his heart trembled as it pleased.

At that moment.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

A sound of knocking on the office’s door was heard.

Chris excused himself to Io, then turned towards the door.

“Come in.”

The instant he spoke those words, the door opened and a young man showed himself.

He passed the letter he was holding in his hand and then exited out again.

Kung.

When the door closed, Chris carefully cut open the envelope and then took out its content.

On the brownish paper, small letters were densely crammed in.

“Hhm.”

Chris, who was looking over the content, leaked out a quiet groan.

His look was slightly panicked.

“What is it?”

Io asked with a worried expression.

Even though Chris had received all kinds of reports until now, it was the first time Io saw him shaken like this.

Chris folded the letter and placed it on top of the table, and then stared straight into Io’s eyes.

‘Should I tell him, or should I not……’

In the first place, they had promised not to hide even a single small thing happening in the Lancephil County.

But he couldn’t help but hesitate to pass at least the content he just received.

“Please tell me truthfully.”

Io spoke in a quiet and low voice.

‘Everything is Sir Count’s share.’

Chris breathed in deeply and extended the letter forwards.

Io similarly extended his hand and picked up the letter.

Rustle.

The thin paper opened fully.

“Ah……”

Suddenly, a quiet exclamation flowed out of Io’s mouth.

Almost as if to rip apart the paper, he tumultuously trembled his body.

Boom.

Io couldn’t hold back in the end and stood up from his seat.

With a shocked expression, Chris followed and stood up.

“Sir Count. You must stay calm.”

His words adamantly tried to stop him.

But Io had already made up his mind.

“No, I cannot be patient any longer. I will lead the troops and charge into the county.”

It didn’t matter even if it was a road leading to death.

Chris stared at Io with complicated eyes.

‘To think they would possibly put their hands on the citizens who aren’t related at all.’

The content of the report he just read tore through the inside of his head.

It was a story about hundreds of the fief’s citizens around the Pavor Castle were being executed.

He could understand Io’s rage.

But even so, he had to stop him.

He had to hold onto Io at least until Roan came back.

“Sir Count. Count Chase Forces and the Owells Forces are hiding in ambush outside the fort.”

It was the truth.

Agens and the Tenebra Troop had already grasped such facts perfectly.

Io breathed in deeply, then spoke in a calm but blazing voice.

“I know. My life will become perilous. But even so, I cannot only watch innocent citizens die.”

A light flashed from his eyes.

“I am their father, and they are my children.”

His face and voice were resolute.

Io, who had stayed even when Albert Wein whom he roamed the battlefields together with for tens of years was captured, simply couldn’t endure at least the news of the execution of the citizens.

He put Chris, who was desperately trying to stop him, behind him and went out of the office.

Soon, the Count Lancephil Troops lined up in front of the 1st Castle’s gate.

“Those who wish can stay behind.”

At Io’s words, the Count Forces’ soldiers smiled.

There was no particular need to speak up and talk.

They already had made the resolve to march through the bloody road with Io.

Ggiiiik!

The tightly closed gate opened.

As if he had been waiting, Io kicked his horse.

Hihihihing!

The war horse cried out long and kicked off the ground.

Dudududu!

Soon, a white cloud of dust rose with the sound of horse hooves.

Like that, Io charged towards the heart of the enemies on his own.

“Ah……”

Chris stood on the castle wall and quietly stared at that sad and beautiful march.

A heavy sigh extended long.

‘Sir Count. If the situation truly becomes hard, you must do as I told you.’

His heart felt heavy.

Before parting ways, Chris and Io shared a secret conversation for a long while.

‘Since he said to do so, I will just have to believe him.’

Now, the work left was just one.

Chris called the messenger bird with a hand gesture.

A letter was quickly written down.

Pdduk!

A bird tied with a tube flew up into the sky.

The direction it flew was south.

At that place was Roan.

*****

It wasn’t surprising.

If it was Io, if it was Io Lancephil, he thought that he would easily have done more than that.

‘No, in the first place, him leaving his retainers behind and escaping the fief on his own is a surprising event.’

Roan, who had left the Poskein Lake Subjugation to Semi and quickly climbed north, reached the 1st Castle merely two days after Io had left.

He first allowed the tired soldiers and horses to rest, then quickly called a meeting of the commanders.

“How is the situation?”

At the short question, Chris stood up from his seat.

“Firstly, Sir Count is in a very dangerous situation according to the report of the Agens agents acting within the Lancephil County and Tenebra Troop members who followed along with Sir Count Lancephil. He had received attacks from Count Chase Forces and Owells Forces the very moment after he left the 1st Castle, and about twenty big and small battles have continued on until now.”

“Hmm.”

Sounds of groan leaked out from here and there.

On the other hand, Roan was calm.

“Is sir still climbing north?”

At those words, Chris shook his head.

“That isn’t so. He is currently tied down.”

“Because of the traitors?”

Austin asked with a brightly flushed face.

Chris shook his head once again.

“No. It’s because of the fief’s citizens.”

It was a completely unexpected answer.

Everyone creased their brows.

But, only Roan had surmised what kind of situation it was.

“It seems the fief’s citizens are stopping Sir Count’s climb north.”

“Yes. According to the report, the nearby region’s citizens have all come together and are blocking Sir Count’s march. Because the fief’s citizens……”

“Because they know the truth that Sir Count Lancephil will die if he goes to the Pavor Castle.”

Chris slowly nodded his head at Roan’s words.

“Yes. That is correct.”

The short answer passed.

A heavy silence fell within the meeting room.

Io who had thrown away his life to save the fief’s citizens and was marching towards the Pavor Castle.

The fief’s citizens who stood and blocked Io’s path of march to save him.

Their feelings for each other were truly incredible.

Their hearts became hot.

The commanders including Austin couldn’t hold themselves and stood up from their seats.

“Let us march right away!”

“Let’s go save Sir Count!”

“We have made our preparations!”

Powerful voices rocked the meeting room.

At that moment, Clay, who had been sitting quietly, subtly shook his head.

“That is impossible.”

His voice was very calm unlike the other people.

Then, the commanders’ sharp gazes fell down.

But despite so, Clay continued his words without changing his look a single bit.

“The capital has sent an order not to participate in the current fief war. If we were to personally join in on the fief war, we would turn all the nobles of the kingdom into enemies. No, perhaps we may be executed by decapitation for the crime of ignoring the capital’s order.”

The quiet voice pierced through the ears of the highly excited commanders.

“Ugh.”

Austin swallowed back a groan with an uncomfortable look, then powerlessly sat down.

“Then are you saying that we should just watch like this?”

“If Sir Count were to die at this rate……”

“The Northeast will fall into Count Chase’s claws.”

Comments mixed with worries poured out from here and there.

Clay, with a calm expression, shook his head once again.

“No, I meant that it is so if the situation is as it originally was. But thankfully, it seems our side’s situation has slightly changed.”

“What are you talking about?”

Austin angrily shouted aloud.

Clay turned his head and stared at Chris.

“I heard that President Chris has already started the work.”

At those words, everyone’s gazes headed towards Chris.

At the gazes that poured down, Chris made a bitter smile.

‘So he already knew even that far……’

He inwardly awed greatly at Clay’s intelligence strength and ability.

He faintly smiled and carefully opened his mouth.

“I have prepared a hand in the Montea Mountain.”

The instant his words ended, puzzled voices flowed out from here and there.

“If it’s Montea Mountain, the place where our magic stone mine is?”

“Isn’t it the mountain located located in the western part of Count Lancephil’s territory?”

“Yeah, that’s right. We also built a fort while opening the mine.”

Because it was a highly important mine, it was a place that the Lancephil Fief Regiment and the Tale Fief Regiment were working together to protect.

Suddenly, the heat inside the meeting room fiercely blazed up.

At that moment, Roan, who had been staying quiet, opened his mouth.

“All forces prepare to march.”

“Yes? Yes!”

The commanders, including Austin, answered in a moment of confusion.

However, the confused looks were still strong on their faces.

Harrison couldn’t hold back and asked in a worried voice.

“My lord. We can’t participate in the current fief war due to the capital’s order.”

Roan didn’t carelessly opened his mouth.

Instead, the answer flowed out from an odd place.

“Please don’t worry.”

It was Clay.

He cheerily smiled and spoke on.

“Since we aren’t participating in the fief war for the time being.”

His smile became much thicker.

“Well, it is still for the time being.”

His gaze turned towards Chris once again.

“Isn’t that right, mister president?”

Chapter 161




T/n: Sorry about the lateness. I finally found a new PR who will help us out (for sure) until st8_lupe comes back (or for a month at least). Thank you very much for your patience. Also, this is a double release with ch. 162, but neither of them are sponsored chapter.

The gate of the Tale Barony Northern Road Troop’s 1st Castle opened fully.

The castle guards stood on top of the walls and saluted.

Below them.

From the fully opened gates, a crimson wave poured out.

These ones, wearing the crimson armors dyed in Sethus’ blood, were the Tale Legion with Roan at the lead.

The crimson light, flashing from receiving the light, exuded a strange dignity.

But in actuality, the faces of the soldiers reflected a hint of anxiety.

“Is it okay to do this?”

“Didn’t they say not to join in on the fief war?”

Sound of whispers floated.

At that moment, one of the thousand-man commanders, who were each leading a troop, glared at them.

“Quiet! Haven’t you heard the lord’s words? We are marching to protect our assets located within the Lancephil fief. We aren’t entering the fief war!”

A stern voice hit the ears.

The few soldiers who were whispering closed their mouths.

The thousand-man commander’s words were the truth.

Before the march, Roan stood in front of the soldiers and revealed the destination and goal of the march.

The destination was Montea Mountain.

The goal.

Was the protection of the magic stone mine, the fort, and the Ford Mining Co. of Tale Commerce Division located within the Lancephil fief.

According to the story Roan revealed before the march, the Montea Mountain’s magic stone mine and the fort had received damage from Count Chase Forces and Owells Forces’ attack.

The march was unavoidable.

But even so, they had no plan to carelessly enter the fief war.

In fact, Roan had given an order to repeatedly wrap the weapons besides the armors in rough clothes and hide them.

It was an act to show that they had no desire to fight.

“My lord. Has the Montea Mountain really received an attack?”

Amongst the thousand-man commanders, Harrison came close to Roan and cautiously asked.

Roan merely made a faint smile and did not answer.

At that moment, Chris, who was next to them, spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Sometimes, there are moments when the situation itself is more important than the truth.”

They were strange words.

With a puzzled look, Harrison stared at Roan’s side and then returned to his original position.

Clay, who was slightly apart, saw that sight and exhaled a short sigh.

“Huu. The lord is like that, the retainers are also like that, everyone’s hearts are too soft……”

They lacked the venomous side that could fool, trample, and mercilessly crush the others for one’s own profit.

‘I’ll have to fill that part.’

The only one who could act that role in the Tale Barony was Clay.

No, there at least was one more person who had a similar disposition.

‘President Chris……’

The man who devised and commanded this plan at the head.

Clay’s gaze headed towards Chris.

‘He’s a more amusing man than I thought.’

Somehow, he was a person whose future Clay looked forwards to.

At that moment.

Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum!

With a clamorous sound of drums, a group of troop showed itself from over a hill.

Simmons Troop.

The troop flag flapped harshly.

An affiliate of the Count Chase Forces, they were the troop that were monitoring and checking the 1st Castle.

“Stop!”

Simmons, who was leading the troop, shouted at the top of his lungs and blocked in front of Roan and the Tale Legion.

It was a sudden confrontation.

Roan raised his right hand and stopped the legion.

For a moment, a silence fell heavily.

Prururu.

The neighs of the horses sounded noisily.

“Where are you going?”

Simmons’ face was originally rough.

And as he even glared his eyes fiercely, his face became heinously abominable.

At the rather threatening tone, the commanders including Austin became enraged.

“You dare in front of……”

“Stop.”

Roan raised his hand and restrained his retainers.

Simmons inwardly snorted as he looked at that sight.

‘Bastard that became a noble from good luck.’

In his heart, he looked down on Roan.

He was envious at the sight of a commoner spearman becoming the kingdom’s noble and spreading his fame.

Roan quietly glared at that Simmons.

‘Hmph. What will a mere brat like you going to do by glaring? Even amongst the Count Chase Forces, I’m a one whose future is bright…… Hph!’

Simmons, who was looked down in his heart, involuntarily gulped back an empty air.

“Kuk!”

With a groan, he gritted his teeth.

It was because an incredible pressure sprouted out from Roan.

That wasn’t a killing intent or animosity.

‘Thi, this is……’

A pressure that naturally made others lower their heads.

A dignity that only a great general who roamed the battlefields for decades could exude.

Roan’s pressure was similar to that.

“Reveal your affiliation and name.”

He spoke in a low and soft but powerful voice.

Roan looked straight into Simmons’ eyes.

When Simmons couldn’t easily answer and hesitated, the pressure spewing from Roan’s body became a level stronger.

“Kuk!”

His throat closed up tight.

The head he was forcefully holding up lowered on its own.

“I’m troop commander Simmons of Count Chase Forces’ Simmons Troop.”

Roan pulled back the pressure only then.

“I’m Baron Roan Tale. We have marched to protect the Baron Tale House’s asset in the Montea Mountain. We have no desire to enter the fief war.”

At the same time, he slightly raised his left hand.

The Tale Legion’s soldiers showed the weapons tightly wrapped in rough clothes.

“Hhm.”

Simmons leaked a short groan.

He looked truly troubled.

‘I can tell that they had no intention to fight, but……’

He couldn’t blindly step back.

“I will send a messenger to Sir Count Chase. Please wait until then.”

Simmons spoke in his most polite attitude and voice.

Roan slightly creased his forehead.

“Do you plan to keep a noble of the kingdom standing on a dirt road?”

Originally, he didn’t like showing off the power of nobility or pressure people using status.

But to someone like Simmons, there was no method more effective than this.

“That, that isn’t……”

Simmons shook his head with a flustered expression.

Roan’s words continued.

“Further, I am merely trying to protect the right I have. If you have the right to carry out the fief war, I have the right to protect my wealth.”

A powerful voice tore through the ears.

Already, Simmons spirit was greatly pressured.

Furthermore, it was not possible for Simmons Troop’s strength to stop Roan’s legion.

In the end, Simmons, who rolled his head this way and that, lowered his head.

“U, understood. But, but you definitely cannot enter the fief war.”

“Of course.”

Roan answered shortly.

Simmons, unable to dare and without looking at Roan’s face, receded back.

Soon, the Simmons Troop that was blocking their fronts moved back to one side.

Clip clop. Clip clop.

With sounds of the horse hooves, Roan and the Tale Legion began to advance once again.

The crimson wave that momentarily stopped swayed.

On the faces of Tale Legion’s soldiers, an obvious pride floated up.

‘Even Count Chase Forces are flustered by our lord.’

‘Even though that gigantic Sethus wasn’t an opponent for our lord, how dare a mere troop commander……’

‘Right. As long as the lord is here, there is no need to be scared and be unnerved.’

The anxiety and worry that had took place in one corner of their hearts disappeared as if washed clean.

A strength was carried in the crimson wave, no, the crimson legion’s march.

“But my lord.”

At that moment, Austin came up to Roan’s side and spoke in a careful voice.

“This road isn’t the road towards the Montea Mountain. If we want to go to the Montea Mountain, we need to turn our direction here towards the west.”

At those words, Roan faintly smiled and answered.

“Roads are made to connect towards anywhere. Let’s do some sightseeing while on the way.”

Roan’s gaze headed towards the end of the road that extended in front of his eyes.

“However I see it, it seems the sight on this road is better.”

Strange words fell onto the road.

His gaze was already chasing a place that couldn’t be seen.

*****

“Sir Duke Webster! No, grandfather! Are you really going to merely keep watching like this?”

The owner of the loud voice was the First Prince Simon Rinse.

He, with Duke Bradley Webster, one of the Rinse Kingdom’s four dukes and his own maternal grandfather, in front of him, shouted aloud.

On the other hand, Bradley was sitting still and was tilting a cup of tea with a composed expression.

“Grandfather! Already, almost half of the Lancephil County’s land has fallen into Count Chase’s hand. The Lancephil County will forever disappear at this rate.”

Count Io Lancephil, who was on the side of those of large power even amongst the nobles who supported Simon.

He was facing a peril of being overthrown.

“Grandfather!”

Simon shouted once again.

Bradley only then put down the teacup he was holding and made a faint smile.

“Prince.”

At the soft and calm voice, Simon, who was storming about in fit, startled and trembled his body.

He realized late that he was acting too rampageously.

“Please speak.”

Simon forcefully suppressed his anger and sat down.

Bradley stared still at such Simon, then spoke in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“In truth, this fief war is flowing more complicated than you think.”

“Please don’t talk around and speak shortly only the important points.”

Simon had no desire to listen a miscellaneous story.

Bradley nodded his head.

“In truth, Count Io Lancephil isn’t supporting your highness the prince because he trusts and likes you. He is merely loyal to the Rinse Kingdom. Due to that, he is merely supporting your highness based on the principle of inheritance by eldest.”

“I already know of that, sir. That is Count Lancephil’s personality and values.”

Because he was like that, he was someone he could trust even more.

It was because there was no chance of him changing the prince he support for a miscellaneous reason.

Of course, this was Simon’s thought, and Bradley’s thought was completely different.

“It is true that Count Lancephil is trustworthy. But the problem is, he isn’t easy to control. He is someone who thinks of the kingdom first before the prince or the throne succession competition. If a situation where a blood is shed arises in the throne succession competition in the future, he will definitely be unwilling to move actively.”

Even if one had a sharp sword and a strong shield, there was no use if one couldn’t utilize them.

To Bradley, Io was an existence similar to unuseable sword and shield.

“Furthermore, he is an individual without even an ambition or greed.”

He had no ambition and greed to raise the prince he support onto the throne and grasp wealth, honor, and power in his hands.

“Because of that, he is much harder to control.”

“Hmm.”

Simon sat quietly and leaned his ears at Bradley’s story.

Bradley pushed his face forwards and spoke in a much quieter voice.

“During that time, a contact came from Viscount Kali Owells amongst Count Lancephil House’s retainers.”

“If it is Kali Owells……?”

Simon creased his forehead with a slightly shocked expression.

Bradley formed a peculiar smile.

“He is the bastard who betrayed Count Lancephil and has side with Count Chase’s side.”

After a short silence, a shocking story continued on.

“Kali Owells. He hasn’t sided with Count Chase, but is pretending to have sided. He is actually someone from our side.”

“Just how……”

Simon, with a perplexed look, hesitated the end of his words.

Bradley’s words continued to follow on.

“In truth, Viscount Owells has been contacting me since the time Count Lancephil had took apart and gave the Tale region to Baron Roan Tale. It meant asking for support when he would later inherit the Lancephil County. But as you know, Count Lancephil has a great interest in Baron Tale. It was a situation where the Lancephil County could go over to Baron Tale if not careful. Due to that……”

For a while, unbelievable stories continued on.

“Hmm.”

Simon, who had heard all of the story, leaked a quiet groan.

He looked straight into Bradley’s eyes.

‘Instead of Io Lancephil who is hard to control, he planned to make Kali Owells into Lancephil County’s lord?’

That wasn’t all.

‘After that, he planned to raise the fief war again and swallow even the Chase County using that Kali……’

The fief war that was currently happening was all unfolding on top of Bradley’s palm.

“Prince.”

Bradley brightly smiled and lowered his head diagonally.

Somehow, it was a despicable and spiteful looking sight.

“Please don’t worry of anything and trust me. You will have a much greater support faction once this event ends.”

As soon as those words ended, Simon stood up from his seat.

His face was solid stiff.

The anger was gone, but an unknown sense of displeasure was smeared on.

Simon asked with a calm and quiet voice.

“Is that support faction something that supports me, or is it supporting grandfather?”

He hadn’t know of anything.

At the place he knew nothing of, a situation he knew nothing of was unfolding.

Simon’s eyes burned blazingly.

‘Oh ho. Look at this kid……’

Bradley inwardly smiled while looking at that sight.

‘Even though I broke him so much, a tiger is a tiger, is it. But……’

The tips of his eyes softly curved.

‘A tiger too is possible to be trained as much as needed.’

Bradley hid his secret intent and lowered his head.

“It is obviously a faction supporting the prince.”

Simon quietly stared at that sight, then wordlessly moved his steps.

Once he exited the brilliant reception room, Viscount Tio Ruin who was guarding the surrounding approached.

“Viscount Ruin.”

“Yes. Prince.”

At Simon’s call, Tio slightly lowered his head.

Simon moved his steps into the insides of a hallway as he spoke in a small voice as if to whisper.

“I will have to change the horse.”

Instantly, Tio asked back with a shocked expression.

“Eh? What do you……”

“The horse I’ve been riding has began to run about mad.”

“Hmm.”

Tio gulped back a groan.

He needlessly looked about the surroundings and asked cautiously.

“Have you chosen a horse to change onto?”

At those words, Simon nodded his head.

“I won’t need to ride an old horse while starting new, and……”

His steps began to become slightly faster.

“At this rate, a young horse that was just born instead should be good.”

*****

Dududududu!

The sound of the horse hooves loudly rang.

Piiing! Ping! Pibing!

With sharp sounds of impact, arrows poured down.

“Kuk!”

“Kuuk!”

Several horsemen that were riding madly were struck by the arrows and fell.

“Chanz! Ronbert!”

The white-haired old man who was running at the very front looked back and shouted.

“Please don’t look back!”

“Keep running on! Sir Count!”

The horsemen that rolled on the ground, Chanz and Ronbert stood up instantly and pulled out their swords.

Gritting their teeth, they raced towards a cavalry.

It was a look of mantises trying to stop a cart.

But on the two men’s faces, there wasn’t even a hint of hesitation or fear.

Kwagagagang!

Soon, they were swept away by the pursuit troop’s charge and departed from their lives.

“Chase them!”

“We must not lose them!”

“Chase them! Capture Io Lancephil alive!”

The white-haired old man looked at that sight and tightly bit his lower lips.

The white-haired old man, he was Io Lancephil.

The armor was scratched here and there or had fallen off, and the revealed skin was completely covered in wounds.

When the innocent citizens of the fief were executed because of him, he had led a small-scale troop and had charged towards the Pavor Castle.

It was the very charge that Chris had desperately tried to stop.

The Count Chase forces and the Owells Forces, which were monitoring the 1st Castle, actively reacted at Io’s charge.

They had sent an elite troop and had tried to capture Io alive.

However, Io was an old veteran of hundreds of battles.

He had avoided the large battles, focused his entire forces, and attacked the places that the enemy hadn’t expected.

Ghostlike and swift strategies and tactics.

And an unmatched valor and strength on top.

A successive series of victories that no one had expected continued on.

Io was Io.

But once the battles reached about twentieth, the Count Chase Forces and the Owells Forces took out an absurd tactic.

‘To think they would use the fief’s citizens as shields……’

Once the situation reached this point, Io couldn’t carelessly give the order to attack.

The force that had been successively victorious fell in an instant.

Io could only continue to fall back, and had lost countless soldiers while doing so.

‘If the people of the nearby villages didn’t help me, we would likely have been annihilated a long time ago.’

To protect Io, the villagers had put down their sickles and spades and had picked up bamboo spears and worn-out swords.

They, to save Io, threw away their precious lives on their own.

‘Any further advance was impossible.’

If it was a fair and front fight, he had the confidence to win easily.

But he couldn’t pour down an attack towards the fief’s citizens who had stepped forwards as the enemy’s shields.

Ultimately, he chose retreat.

But that too wasn’t an easy decision.

Already, the path of retreat was tightly blocked.

At that moment, what came up in his mind was, in fact, Chris’ advice.

‘If the situation becomes truly perilous, please run towards the west.’

From a quick listen, they were absurd words.

To tell him to run not towards the northeast or east where the Guardian Army was resisting or the south where the Tale Barony is, but towards the west where the Chase County is.

It was the same as telling him to walk into a tiger’s mouth.

However, Io did not hesitate even for a moment.

‘If it is Chris, he is a genius amongst geniuses who Roan greatly value and trust. There is no way that he would say nonsense.’

Like that, Io led the soldiers who were still alive and began to run towards the west.

‘Jonathan Chase, Kali Owells. I will definitely cut you bastards’ necks. To think you would dare push my children, my citizens forwards as shields……’

His teeth gritted naturally.

Io kicked his horse’s stomach and continued to sprint west and west.

It was a run with his life on the line.

But unexpectedly, the western region’s guards were lax.

It was because even Count Chase Forces and Owells Forces had not expected that Io to possibly run towards the west.

‘Has Chris aimed at this very point?’

But the problem was after that.

They couldn’t simply continue to run towards the west.

Even though the border may be lax right now, the surroundings were all Count Chase Forces’ base.

During that while, although small, a pursuit troop had caught up right behind their heads.

It literally was a moment of life and death.

But even so, Io did not gave up.

‘Whatever happens, I will survive until the end and have my revenge.’

He gritted his teeth.

‘Even if I have to sell my soul, definitely!’

A light flashed in his eyes.

Suddenly.

“Un?”

A very small and strange voice that tickled his ears was heard.

“A sound of music?”

It was a sound that simply couldn’t be heard in a such situation and a place like that.

As they headed farther and farther towards the west, that sound was gradually heard more clearly.

Chang! Chajang! Dudum! Phbababam!

It was the sound of music heard by a harmony of various instruments.

The even stranger thing was.

‘It’s a familiar sound.’

However, he didn’t remember where he had heard the sound.

At that moment, several soldiers came up to his side.

“We can hear a sound of music.”

“Furthermore, it’s a very familiar sound to the ears.”

They spoke the same words as Io.

Io and the remaining alive soldiers, while tilting their heads, pressed their chests onto the backs of their horses.

Behind them, the pursuit troop followed right behind.

“Uurat!”

“Go up onto the hill.”

Io and the soldiers kicked their horses.

The tired horses plucked up their strength and furiously climbed up the hill that rose in front of them.

Hwaa!

Suddenly, their views instantly opened up with a western wind.

The sound of music that was heard softly was heard sonorously.

Phbababam! Phabam! Phababam!

Sounds that hit not the ears but the chest.

“Ah……”

From Io’s mouth, a quiet gasp exploded out.

The sight that spread in front of his eyes.

That almost brought a crimson wave to the mind.

The music flowed out from within that wave.

A sound familiar to the ears.

“So it is the Milta military band’s performance that greeted me and Baron Tate when we visited the Mediasis Castle.”

He remembered everything clearly.

With the sound of music, the crimson wave approached right in front of his nose.

A crimson legion.

Several familiar faces were seen in his eyes.

The soldiers split apart to left and right, and the young man he missed even in his dreams showed himself.

“Roan……”

Io shook his dry lips.

Goose bumps rose all over his body.

The young man who appeared together with the crimson legion.

He was Roan.

Roan slowly rode his horse towards Io.

The Milta military band’s performance continued on until Roan reached in front of Io.

Chang!

A clear metallic sound noted the end of the music.

Roan saluted as if he had been waiting.

Chk!

The Tale Legion’s soldiers all lowered their heads.

A perfectly ordered and powerful motion.

A courteous and polite attitude.

Roan faintly smiled and stared at Io.

“We came to greet you. Sir Count Lancephil.”

Fief War (4) End.

Chapter 162




T/n: Just a normal double chapter. Not a sponsored. Next chapter will be up tomorrow.

It was an uneventful life.

No, it was an extremely ordinary life.

He was born in a so-so house and lived a so-so life with a so-so talent.

And during that time, a fief war broke out between the Chase County and the Lancephil County.

Soon, a large scale draft was invoked.

Ronball, who had once served in the army as a horseman, had received the squad commander role for a cavalry squad that were made up of nobodies.

It was a situation that one could call it a success if one wished.

He stayed at the back of the Count Chase Forces and had received the mission of converting the Lancephil Fief’s citizens.

Although it was so far away place that there was no chance of raising a big merit, it was that much safe place as well.

Even though he was sent into a war, boring days after days passed by.

And during that time, the one chance of a lifetime came to him.

“To, to think Io Lancephil would appear in front of my eyes!”

While inspecting the nearby region’s villages like any day, he had discovered Count Io Lancephil, who was running towards the west.

Although there were few soldiers who were guarding him, they all had disastrous looks, so it wasn’t a situation to be greatly afraid.

‘If I just catch Io, I can flip this life around!’

He instantly led the squad and went on a chase.

But with a cavalry made up of nobodies, it was closer to an empty dream to catch Io and his elite soldiers.

‘But even so, I thought that I would ultimately be able to catch him.’

Io’s direction of run was west.

West was the place Chase County was.

He thought that he would ultimately be driven into a corner.

But Ronball’s such thought disappeared as if washed away the moment he climbed up onto the hill that rose in front of his eyes.

“Ah……”

The rose-tinted future dyed into an ashen light.

‘Even though I did say the ordinary life was boring……’

A spiritless voice leaked out of his mouth.

“I didn’t want it to be this dramatic.”

A dry spit naturally gulped back.

“Hic!”

His ally soldiers, who had catched up a moment late, hiccuped with frighten white faces.

“Hic! Hic!”

“Hic!”

The hiccups spread here and there like an epidemic.

‘Le, let’s get a hold of myself.’

Ronball tightly grabbed onto his fainting mind.

‘Ce, certainly, they said no one could enter in on this fief war.’

He remembered the content of the order that came from the capital, Miller.

He inhaled deeply and looked at the bottom of the hill.

A crimson wave, no, a crimson legion.

On the troop flag that rose high, the name of the young man who shook and rang the Rinse Kingdom was written.

Roan Tale.

Gulp.

A dry spit gulped back again.

Ronball got down from his horse and went down to the bottom of the hill.

“I, I’m squad commander Ro, Ronball of Count Chase Force’s Kerro Troop.”

He tried to disguise his facial expression with a bold look, but his words kept getting caught on his tongue.

“I am Roan Tale.”

Roan, who was watching Io’s treatment, took a step forwards.

His voice was bold and dignified.

‘Thi, this man is the very hero of the expedition and the one who suppressed Elton Coat’s rebellion……’

Ronball unknowingly tinged a look of admiration in his eyes.

Roan, who became a noble from a commoner background, was an idol of envy as well as awe.

But he soon discovered Io, was was being treated within the Tale Legion, and collected his mind.

“Si, Sir Baron. We, we are currently carrying out the fief war. The capital has forbidden anyone who aren’t directly involved from entering the fief war. If, if you enter the fief war without permission like this, a big trouble for the future will follow.”

His words kept stuttering.

His face burned up brightly from embarrassment.

“We have no desire to enter the fief war.”

As soon as Roan’s words finished, the Tale legion’s soldiers extended and showed the weapons wrapped in rough clothes.

Ronball looked at the sight of the soldiers and then nodded his head.

Certainly, they didn’t seem to have the desire to battle.

‘Th, then……’

His courage slowly arose up.

“Th, then please hand over Sir…… Count Lancephil.”

At those words, Roan made a cheerfully smile.

It was an expression as if he would almost immediately hand over Io.

‘It looks like the situation is resolving well.’

Ronball’s worry soundlessly melted down.

Then.

“I cannot do that.”

He heard a cold voice.

Roan took a step forwards and closer and stared straight into Ronball’s two eyes.

“Sir Count Lancephil is a guest who visited our legion. Indiscreetly chasing out a guest is not the way of the nobility.”

“Eh, eh?”

With a flustered expression, Ronball asked back.

Roan once again took a step forwards and closer.

“Uu……”

Ronball involuntarily and waveringly stepped back.

Roan looked at that sight and formed a faint smile.

“I will say it again, I have no desire to enter the fief war. But I also don’t have any plan to indiscreetly chase out my guests. If you wish to accompany Sir Count Lancephil away, you will have to use force against me.”

Immediately as his words finished, a sharp pressure bursted out from his entire body.

“Huhph!”

Ronball was greatly shocked and fell down on his butt.

The faces of the nobodies who were lined up behind him were also bleached white.

“S, squad commander!”

“Wh, why don’t we just go?”

Their expressions were completely afraid as if they may just lose their life.

In the first place, they were no match for the Tale Legion.

“I, if I were to step back, would you please simply let me go?”

Ronball asked as he waveringly stood up.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Of course.”

As soon as his words finished, Ronball deeply lowered his head, then ran towards his own squad.

Hihihing!

He, who instantly climbed up onto the saddle, led the nobodies and quickly disappeared over the hill.

The thought of catching Io alive and raising a big merit had already long disappeared.

Now, he merely.

‘Want to live.’

He missed the boring and uninteresting life.

Tightly scrunching his body, he kicked his horse’s stomach.

Roan quietly stared at that sight, then headed towards Io again.

Io and the knights who followed him had more or less finished being treated.

“Are you okay, sir?”

“I’m okay. I kept my life thanks to you.”

Io bitterly smiled and grabbed Roan’s shoulder.

Although a tired look was seen, his eyes were still and clearly shining light.

“I’m glad that you are okay.”

He was honest.

However, Io’s heart wasn’t simply happy.

“From now on is the problem.”

There was nothing more he could do.

The number of knights and soldiers below him were now merely in tens.

Although the Guardian Army was resisting in the Northeast region, it was impossible to move all the way there.

But even so, he couldn’t ask of Roan.

‘Since the order has came from the capital, Miller……’

Furthermore, the truth that he had joined Roan’s camp would now soon become known.

However clear Roan revealed that he won’t enter the fief war, they didn’t know how the situation would flow.

The possibility of them using the content of the order as an excuse to request his extradition was high.

‘If Jonathan and Kali cooperate and pressure him, Roan too would find it hard to endure……’

It was an awkward situation.

It was something he couldn’t bear to do to Roan.

In the end, the most realistic method in the current situation was to return to Tale Barony together with Roan and hide himself until the fief war ended.

‘Although even that won’t be easy……’

His heart felt heavy.

A sigh naturally flowed out.

Roan looked at that sight and let out a short sigh.

‘For now, I have rescued Sir Count Lancephil, but……’

Certainly, from now on was a problem.

Originally, his plan was to go into the Montea Mountain’s fort and take a sit at the Count Chase Forces’ rear.

With only having a camp at their back, he thought that he could pressure the Count Chase Forces.

But that too wasn’t a fundamental solution.

When everyone was deep in thoughts from complicated feelings, Clay cheerily smiled and shook his head.

“Everyone is rather excessively deceitful.”

It was a statement that, if not careful, could become a discourtesy.

Roan and Io as well as the nearby commanders all looked at Clay.

Few plainly showed displeased looks.

Clay didn’t mind them and added on with a silvery voice.

“Doesn’t everyone already know the solution?”

The instant his words ended.

“What are you saying?”

“What do you mean?”

“To say there is a solution, what are you talking about?”

The nearby commanders asked with perplexed looks.

Roan and Io stared at Clay without a word.

Clay exhaled a short sigh.

“Do you truly not know? Of this simple solution?”

His voice was overflowing with confidence.

In the end, Io asked with a solid stiff expression.

“What is that simple solution? If I can have vengeance on Jonathan and Kali, I will sell even my soul.”

At those words, Clay shook his head.

“There’s no need for Sir Count to sell even your soul. But……”

HIs gaze glanced and looked back and forth between Io and Roan.

“The Lancephil County and the title of Count are needed.”

Boom.

Instantly, a heavy silence fell down.

Few people made expressions that didn’t understood, and few people made startled shocked expressions.

Clay’s expression was still cheerfully smiling.

“The capital, Miller, has given an order that anyone besides those directly involved must not enter the fief war. Then it means that to enter the fief war……”

He intentionally left open the end of his words.

Io took on the remaining words.

“It should be fine if one becomes directly involved.”

“That is correct, sir.”

Clay quickly nodded his head.

He turned his gaze and looked at Roan.

“Please pass on the Lancephil County and the title of Count to our lord. Then, all the problem will be solved.”

Clay looked long around the surrounding people again and shrugged his shoulders.

“How is it? It’s too simple of a solution, isn’t it?”

His voice was bright and clear.

But the actual mood of the surroundings were extremely heavy.

“Don’t say unnecessary words.”

Roan quietly spoke criticizing words.

With a short sigh, Clay lowered his head.

‘Do you plan to kick away such a good opportunity?’

He forcefully swallowed the words that had climbed up all the way to his throat.

Roan’s expression was that severe and his attitude too had no disturbance.

“O, our lord will take the Lancephil County……?”

“Ridiculous.”

“But it’s true that we can enter the fief war if only that happens.”

“Is it okay to suddenly start something so big?”

The soldiers whispered in small voices.

“Quiet!”

“Be quiet!”

The thousand-man rank commanders quickly quietened the commotion.

Roan lowered his head towards Io.

“Sir Count. Please excuse my retainer’s slip of tongue. For now, I believe it should be good to take refuge in the Tale Barony.”

He proposed the most realistic method.

But, with a solidly stiffen expressen, Io didn’t show any reaction.

The few knights who had lived until the end and were guarding him understood Io’s complicated heart.

‘We will follow our lord’s decision.’

They wordlessly stood and awaited Io’s decision.

After who knows how long.

The western wind became slightly stronger.

“Roan.”

Io finally opened his mouth.

The face that had been stiffen solidly had loosen softly.

“Yes. Sir Count.”

The nearby commanders and the soldiers’ gazes headed towards the two people.

Gulp.

Sounds of nervous gulps came out.

Io stared at Roan and made a faint smile.

“You have a clever retainer.”

He was talking of Clay.

Roan wordlessly and merely lowered his head.

“I won’t say any long words.”

Io continued to speak with a powerful vigor.

“Roan. I will give you my fief and title.”

Boom!

A great shock stormed through the grounds.

The Tale Barony’s retainers formed strange expressions mixed with happy and flustered looks.

That was also the same for the Tale Legion’s soldiers.

They forcefully swallowed the cheers that soared up to their throats.

On the other hand, the knights who had escorted Io tightly bit their lower lips and lowered their heads.

‘Yes. This is the best.’

‘We will respect the lord’s decision.’

Furthermore.

‘If it is Sir Baron Tale, he is a trustworthy man.’

‘He is someone most suited to our fief.’

Even beyond the situation and just looking at the person himself, Roan was the most qualified person.

The knights tightly clenched their fists and raised the lowered heads high.

Their expressions became much brighter.

“Sir Count. Please take back those words.”

Roan quickly lowered his head.

As if it was difficult to dare take it on, he sharply trembled his entire body.

Io looked still at such Roan, then carefully stroke his back.

“It is something I originally……”

His voice became soft.

“Planned to give to you.”

A shock stormed once again.

‘I knew that Sir Count valued our lord, but……’

‘Ah…… so he thought of him that much.’

Baron Tale House’s retainers and soldiers all made deeply moved expressions.

“Sir Count……”

Of course the one who was most moved was Roan.

Roan and Io’s meeting.

The events from that start to today’s events brushed past in front of his eyes.

“Kneel down.”

From his bosom, Io took out the metallic medallion engraved with the crest of Count Lancephil House.

Roan quietly stared at that sight, then bent down on one knee.

The moment he looked at Io’s blazing and honest eyes, he realized that he couldn’t repeatedly refuse.

‘It’s done!’

Clay, who was watching, inwardly shouted in delight.

The event was flowing as he wished.

‘Once the lord climbs up onto the title of a count……’

His path to endless success would also open up.

“Roan.”

Io held the crest of the house up with both hands.

“Because the situation is so, I can only carry this out informally.”

He breathed in deeply.

“As the head of the Count Lancephil House, protect the fief and the fief’s citizens.”

The end of his voice shook.

The thing Io was holding up wasn’t simply the crest of the house.

Right now, he was holding up the past tens of years and centuries of history together with it.

“The fief’s citizens are my children. They are screaming in pain. May you punish the invaders, the traitors, and save my children……”

Io slowly kneeled one knee.

“Ah……”

From somewhere, a quiet gasp flowed out.

At an empty field where the western wind blew.

There was nothing of a splendid stage nor food.

At the place surrounded by the soldiers of the crimson legion.

At the center of that place, Roan and Io each lowered their heads and kneeled their knees.

The Count Lancephil House’s crest passed from Io’s hands to Roan’s hands.

‘Hhm.’

Roan tightly gritted his teeth.

His heart soared up from pride.

He could feel the weight of the medallion.

‘I have become a count of the kingdom……’

It was an event that unfolded much too suddenly.

But he had the confidence to take on that weight.

At that moment.

Phbabam! Pham! Phababam!

The Milta military band performed a grand and powerful music.

It was because Clay had given the order with his eyes.

It was truly a timely action.

Chang!

With a clear sound of metal, the music ended.

Roan received the crest Count Lancephil House with two hands and spoke in a careful voice.

“Sir Count. As the head of the Count House, I will fulfill your call.”

He raised his head and stared at Io.

Io faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

“I will trust you.”

What other words would be needed.

At that moment, the knights who were standing behind Io all saluted.

“We greet Sir Count.”

It was a resounding voice and a powerful movement.

Roan quietly stared at them.

A peculiar air rode the western wind and whirled.

That was a blazing spirit that signalled the start of the counterattack.

Roan turned his head and looked at the soldiers of the Tale Legion.

“All forces……”

He spoke in a quiet voice.

His eyes brightly shined red.

“Prepare for battle!”

A powerful voice rang through the empty field, no, the battlefield.

“Yes sir!”

The soldiers answered in one voice, then untied and shook off the rough clothes that were wrapped on the weapons.

Flap!

The long clothes rode the wind and spread towards all directions.

The Tale Legion stood within the center.

An incredible spirit rode the western wind and stormed.

“Ah……”

Io let out a quiet sigh.

‘It is done. My small wish will definitely be achieved.’

The sight of seeing Jonathan and Kali kneeling below his feet was drawn.

Roan slowly moved his feet and climbed onto his warhorse.

Chang!

With a metallic sound, the Travias Spear showed itself.

“We head to the Pavor Castle!”

The powerful voice hit the ears.

The soldiers strongly grasped their own weapons.

The blood within their entire body circled rapidly and the hearts raced fiercely.

“Let us rescue our brothers and families from the invaders and the traitors!”

Roan raised up his spear high.

“All forces……”

The energy of a moment just before an explosion.

Finally, the order they waited and awaited for fell down.

“Charge!”

Count End.

Chapter 163




T/n: Sorry about the lateness. I got a bit too greedy and tried to do a double chapter release. Well, here are the double chapters.

He wasn’t even enraged.

Instead, the blood within his entire body cooled coldly.

‘Just what great thing would I accomplish with idiots like these……’

Kali Owells sharply glared at the man who was kneeling on one knee in front of the tent.

The surrounding air was frigid.

The Owells Forces’ commanders, including Tairon Bess, merely watched Kali’s mood while stifling their breaths.

“What did you say your name was?”

Kali asked to the man who was kneeling on one knee.

The man answered while only slightly raising his head.

“I’m Simmons, leader of the Simmons Troop of the Count Chase Forces.”

The man was Simmons, who was monitoring the Tale Barony Northern Road Troop’s 1st Castle.

He was the very troop commander who easily opened up the road after being crushed by Roan’s pressure.

“You say that Roan Tale has marched to protect his assets in the Montea Mountain?”

At Kali’s question, Simmons slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. I have already reported to Sir Count Chase as well, but Baron Tale has merely marched to protect his assets and did not show any desire to enter the fief war.”

“What has Sir Count Chase say?”

His voice deeply sank low.

But Simmons, who hadn’t realized this, answered in a calm expression and voice.

“He said to give the same report to Sir Viscount Owells.”

“Was that all?”

Kali asked again.

Simmons nodded his head.

“Yes. He said that I will be able to receive the next order if I do so.”

“The next order, is it……”

Kali blurred the end of his sentence.

He moved his steps towards Simmons.

Looking at Kali who was approaching him, Simmons added on.

“Yes. He said to carry out the order Sir Viscount Owells gives with utmost sincerity regardless of what it is.”

At those words, Kali made a faint yet somehow ghastly smile.

“Truly, he said quite thankful words. No……”

The end of his words momentarily blurred.

He looked straight into Simmons’ eyes.

“He said annoying words.”

“What do you……”

Simmons did not understood and asked back.

Kali did not readily answered and slowly opened his mouth after calming his breath.

“I will give an order.”

At the abrupt words, Simmons made a slightly blank look.

“Ah, yes. P, please grant the order.”

But he soon took a hold of himself and lowered his head.

Kali glared at the back of Simmons’ head and spoke in a cold voice.

“Die.”

“Eh?”

Simmons, with a shocked expression, raised his head.

On his face, the look of asking just what does that mean was clear.

Kali shook his head as he looked at that sight.

“No. I’ll simply……”

His voice was cold.

“Kill you myself.”

Chang!

The instant his words finished, the sword on his waist cut through the space.

“Uh?!”

Simmons, still with a surprised expression, merely blinked his eyes.

Tack!

Kali’s sword returned to its original place.

Sss.

A red line extended following Simmons’ neck.

“Wh, why……’

He looked at Kali with eyes full of disbelief.

Kali said no words.

With the tip of his forefinger, he lightly tapped Simmons’ forehead.

Paat!

Suddenly, hot blood spouted out from the red line drawn through the neck.

At the same time, Simmons’ head that was attached straight fell apart from the body and rolled on the ground.

“Idiotic bastard.”

With a curse, Kali kicked away the large head.

With a dull sound, Simmons’ head bounced and tumbled on the ground.

“There was absolutely no desire to enter the fief war? So you just let him go? You think that…… tch!”

Annoyance erupted.

Kali kicked Simmons’ body, whose head had fallen off, and knocked it down.

‘Anyhow, Sir Count Chase too is truly sly. To think he would borrow another’s hand and make it cut off a stupid subordinate’s head.’

He instantly saw through the reason Count Jonathan Chase had sent Simmons to him.

‘Anyway, he really is a similar man to me.’

Between him and Jonathan, there were many similar points.

‘Because of that, it’s more awkward instead.’

Kali shook his head while making a bitter smile.

Then he soon glared at the nearby commanders and roared.

“All of you keep your heads straight.”

A storm like pressure spewed out of his entire body.

“We have started a revolt right now with our lives on the line! All our necks will be sliced if the work goes wrong!”

The thunderous voice hit the ears.

“Roan Tale going to the Montea Mountain itself is a problem! Actu and Labo lead troops and go to the Montea Mountain. Capture Roan alive. No……”

Kali thought that whether Roan’s words were true or not, he was no different than having already joined the fief war.

“Kill him. Cut off his head!”

The order had fallen.

Actu and Labo took a step forwards and saluted.

“Yes. We will carry out the order.”

They soon ran towards their own troops.

Kali stared at that sight for a moment, then clenched his fist.

“I will send a messenger to Sir Count Chase. The content of the message will be……”

For a while, a long story continued.

One of the commanders wrote down the story into a letter.

A moment later, a messenger riding on a horse started towards the North.

Within his chest pocket, the letter containing Kali’s message was held.

Ggiiiig!

A sharp and peculiar cry sounded.

Above the messenger’s head, an eagle with great wings glided brilliantly.

The direction the eagle flew was also towards north.

That truly was an amazing coincident.

*****

“I told you, it’s true.”

“Eeh, don’t lie.”

At a camp raised on an open plain.

On the inside of the fences, several men gathered and were chatting.

They were the squad commanders of a temporary troop that inspected the nearby villages and converted the Lancephil Fief’s citizens at Count Chase Forces’ rear.

“Really, I could have caught Count Lancephil.”

The man who was heating up with a small voice was no other than Ronball.

He, who ran as if wishing his butt to fall off after meeting with Roan, was laying out a heroic tale.

“It really was just right before catching him, but I ended up meeting Baron Tale at that moment. Tch.”

Ronball smacked his lips regrettably.

One of the men who were quietly listening to his words whispered in a small voice.

“If that’s really true……”

“I told you it’s true.”

Ronball cut in on his words with a frustrated look.

The man shook his hand and nodded his head.

“No, if that’s really true, I think it’ll be good to keep your mouth shut.”

“Un?”

Ronball widely opened his eyes as if saying what does that mean.

The man who just spoke up, with a cautious expression, added on.

“Whatever the situation was, you simply ran away from the moment when this fief war could have ended. If this needlessly goes into higher up’s ears, you might get reprimanded. And……”

His voice slowly became smaller.

“If the day Baron Tale comes to attack comes, a spark might pointlessly fly even towards you.”

At those words, Ronball snickered out a laugh and shook his head.

“No. There’s no way that’ll happen. I told you, Baron Tale had absolutely no desire to join the fief war.”

His voice was full of certainty.

“Then that’s good, but since there is something called just in case.”

The man’s expression was one still full of worry.

Ronball brightly smiled and shook his head.

“It’s true. I saw it, and Baron Tale had absolutely no……”

When his words reached about that point.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

From the direction of the camp’s fences, a panicked sound of a bell rang.

It was the sound signalling an enemy’s attack.

It was an unpleasant sound they absolutely hadn’t heard nor needed to hear until now.

“I, is it Count Lancephil Forces?”

“Even though those guys called Guardian Army are all gathered in the northeast region?”

“Perhaps the Lancephil Fief’s citizens?”

The temporary squad commanders including Ronball kicked and stood up their seats and prepared for battle.

Their faces were brightly flushed.

Because carrying out the conversion of fief’s citizens at the rear were all they had done, they in fact hadn’t experienced a proper battle even once.

The tips of their hands rapidly trembled.

Around them, many commanders and soldiers quickly moved.

Ronball equipped his armor the fastest and pulled out a soldier who was running towards them from the direction of the fences.

“Is it an enemy?”

At the urgently asking sound, the soldier saluted and answered.

“Yes! That is correct, sir!

The instant his words ended, the temporary squad commanders swarmed.

“Wh, who is it?”

“Lancephil Guardian Army?”

“The Count’s forces?”

“The fief’s citizens?”

Questions poured down.

The soldier gulped dry spit and shook his head.

There was no correct answer amongst them.

“Then who is it?”

Ronball asked with a completely tense expression.

The soldier, with a voice that trembled sharply, answered.

“It’s Baron Roan Tale.”

Boom.

For a moment, a heavy silence fell.

The temporary squad commanders turned their heads and looked at Ronball.

Ronball, while feeling the sharp gazes, shook his head.

“No. Tha, that can’t be……”

He murmured as if he was a man who lost his mind.

But the sound heard from the back of his ears were much too clear.

Kwakang!

The sound of the camp’s fences being destroyed along with an explosive sound rang out.

Following that, a flag that rose straight up between the leading cavalry was seen.

Roan Tale.

*****

‘Is this the view of a general……’

Roan clenched his horse’s rein.

The battlefield spread out in front of his eyes.

The Taemusas, who wore crimson armors, were tearing apart the enemy’s camp.

Roan stood in the center of the camp and personally commanded every troop.

The energy and the heat of the battlefield wrapped his entire body.

[Roan. An enemy troop is coming from the left.]

Kinis, who was flying above Roan’s head and observing the battlefield’s state, fussed about.

Roan lightly extended his left hand and sent a hand signal.

“Thousand-man commander Tane. Lead the Panther Troop and towards the left!”

“Yes sir!”

Tane, who was pushing and driving the enemies, lead the troop with an answer and moved.

The left side that had been thin instantly became thick.

Boom!

With an explosive sound, the enemy troop that was aiming for a surprise attack violently collided with the Panther Troop.

[There’s an archer unit at the back!]

Kinis shouted once again with a sharp voice.

‘Un. I saw it too.’

Roan answered shortly and then quickly raised his right hand.

“Be ready for an arrow attack! Raise the Parma!” 1

Parma meant the small shield that the Tale Engineering Department had made by improving and improving again the small-scale shield they developed.

Instantly, the Tale Legion’s soldiers, including the Taemusas, pulled the parmae they wore on their backs and equipped them on their left arm.

Ssweaaaak!

As if they had been waiting, arrows flew up from the enemy’s rear.

Pubububuk!

Dull sounds hit the ears.

The arrows tightly embedded themselves on the strongly raised and supported parmae.

Roan spun the Travias Spear around and struck away all the arrows that flew towards him.

“Charge! Charge the enemies!”

He bent his upper body and kicked his horse.

Before the enemy archer unit’s arrow attack continued, he planned to completely destroy the enemy position.

“Protect the lord!”

“Follow the lord’s back!”

The thousand-man and higher ranked commanders shouted at the top of their lungs.

Ttdududuk!

The Tale Legion’s soldiers stroke away the arrows planted on the parmae with the weapons on their hands and kicked off the ground.

A charge like a flash of lightning.

They did not fear close quarter combat or scuffle.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

With metallic sounds, sparks flew.

Sssguk! Ssskuk!

Soon, horrifying sounds followed.

The enemies’ necks were cut and the hearts were pierced.

“Damn it! Stop them!

“Stop them! Capture the enemy commander!”

The Count Chase Force reorganized their lines and aimed for a counterattack.

They aimed for Roan, who stood at the front and was personally waging a scuffle.

But.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

The soldiers fell with throes of death.

The Count Chase Force’ ordinary soldiers weren’t a match for Roan.

Each time Roan swung the spear once, three or four soldiers lost their lives and fell.

“Damn it! Move aside!”

Rogers, who had the highest rank amongst the Count Chase Force’s commanders, stepped forwards.

He raised up his spear high and lunged at Roan.

“Roan Tale! For you to dare go against the capital’s order and enter the fief war! I Rogers will cut off your……”

When his words had reached about that point.

“Sorry but there is no time to chat right now.”

Roan swung the Travias Spear he held in a long line.

The solid handle of the spear softly bent and even its length abruptly extended out.

Ssskuk!

The blade of the spear instantly cut Rogers’ neck.

It was an absurd death.

“Hii!

“Uaaaah!”

At the commander’s death, the morale of the Count Chase Force’ soldiers was snapped apart.

Even the formation that were getting reorganized perfectly collapsed.

After that, the battle flowed in a very one-sided direction.

No, from the start, the battle was one-sided.

The troop that was left at the rear and merely did inspections were no match for the Tale Legion.

“We will let live those who surrender. Those who will fight under the Tale Legion’s flag, throw away your weapons and surrender!”

Roan’s voice rang the battlefield.

Few soldiers glanced at others, then soon threw away their weapons, ran towards the Tale Legion, and kneeled.

Amongst them, even Ronball’s figure was seen.

It was enough for even the squad commanders, although temporary, to surrender.

The Tale Legion’s power was just that incredible.

But surprisingly, the number of those who surrendered wasn’t many.

‘Even though it’s a fief war, would he really kill us all?’

‘He probably would only be able to let us go, right?’

‘It’s a prisoner treatment at most, tch.’

They were complacent thoughts.

It was a fief war between nobles of the same kingdom.

Furthermore in Roan’s case, the rumor of him being a good person was renowned.

He wouldn’t indiscreetly take the soldiers’ lives.

That was the thoughts of Count Chase Force’s soldiers.

‘Even if they don’t know, these bastards don’t know our lord too much.’

Looking at that sight, Austin inwardly shook his head.

It was definitely true that Roan was a good person.

Sometimes, there were times when he was excessively delicate and soft.

But that was talking of the usual Roan.

The Roan on the battlefield was a completely different person.

“Is this all?”

Roan quietly whispered while looking at the surrendered soldiers.

Simultaneously, he raised his left hand and gave a short hand signal.

“Execute all those who did not surrender.”

It was a cold judgment.

But even to Roan, this was an inevitable decision.

‘If we look at only the number of soldiers, we are inferior.’

The situation was same as fighting two counties.

‘There is no reserve to control enemy prisoners.’

It wasn’t a situation to be leisurely.

But even so, it wasn’t a condition that they couldn’t simply let them go.

‘War isn’t a joke.’

Abruptly, he remembered Clay’s request.

We cannot take prisoners. Unconditionally execute them, my lord.

Even without that particular request, Roan had no plans to leave a future trouble.

“Yes sir!”

The Tale Legion’s soldiers, without even a single bit of hesitation, answered.

“Hihii!”

“You, you will kill the same kingdom’s people?”

The Count Chase Force’s soldiers screamed with bleached white expressions.

“Same kingdom’s people?”

Roan, with a calm and quiet voice, answered.

“On the battlefield……”

He soon pulled his reins and turned the horse around.

“There are only allies and enemies.”

A cold-blooded and frigid voice fell onto the ground.

Simultaneously.

“Execute them!”

The three-thousand-man commander Austin’s order fell down.

Instantly, Taemusas as well as Tale Legion’s soldiers raised their weapons and lunged.

Sssguk! Ssskuk!

“Uak!”

“Sa, save me!”

“Ku uk!

With a frightening sound, sounds of scream echoed through the land.

At those sounds, the ones who surrendered trembled their body.

And at the same time, a sense of relief at having survived wrapped their body.

Roan, feeling the western wind that blew towards them, murmured in a small voice.

“This is war.”

He did not wish to put up a particularly kind looking pretense.

One would die if one did not kill.

A cold-hearted world.

That very place was the battlefield.

Roan forcefully ignored the sound of screams that were heard and closed his eyes.

‘Chris and Clay……’

The figures of the two people, who should be moving busily by now, appeared in his mind.

While marching towards the Pavor Castle, Roan simultaneously proceeded numerous works.

He did not wish to stop this fief war merely at the level of saving the Lancephil Fief and the fief’s citizens.

‘If everything we have prepared until now only connects into one……’

Roan was already looking at a place beyond that.

Somehow, the goal that was only like a dream now felt like something that was possible in reality.

‘Anyhow, Sir Count Lancephil, no, is he now godfather Lancephil…… godfather should have safely arrive, right?’

Io Lancephil took on a difficult mission on his own and had left for the capital, Miller.

‘Since he said to simply trust him, I will simply trust him and wait.’

Roan faintly smiled and exhaled a short sigh.

The western wind blew increasingly stronger.

Enter the War (1) End.

Chapter 164




T/n: Sponsored Chapter (finally.)

‘It’s noisy.’

The Rinse Kingdom’s current King, Deni Von Rinse, looked at the nobles that filled the grand hall full and frowned.

‘Really, I said I’ve no interested……’

Today as well, his situation was that of attending the meeting against his will at the request of the nobles.

On his face, a tired and bored expression was full.

“Baron Tale’s action is an act that disregards the Rinse Royalty!”

“It’s the same as treason!”

“To dare ignore his majesty the king’s order and enter the fief war! You really can’t help the nature of the lowly things. Tch tch tch.”

Criticizing and censuring sounds rose from here and there.

Most of them were the nobles who supported the Second Prince Tommy Rinse and the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

“All of you are saying too much!”

“We haven’t grasp the exact truth yet!”

“That is correct. For what reason Baron Tale has entered the fief war, please criticize or censure after checking that first.”

The nobles who supported Simon countered back.

If they simply kept their mouths shut here, the possibility of losing a reliable comrade called Roan Tale was high.

“Your majesty the king! Baron Tale has went against your majesty’s order and has personally entered the fief war! This is something absolutely unforgivable!”

“Please give the summoning order immediately!”

The nobles who were raising their voices suddenly swarmed towards Deni III.

When the nobles supporting Tommy and Kallum uttered their appeals, the nobles supporting Simon too bowed towards Deni III.

“Your majesty, we must precisely question the front and back circumstances for such a heavy and important matter.”

“Since many couriers will soon bring the news, please be deliberate at least until then.”

They were stories and opinions that perfectly oppose each other.

Sharp voices and urgent voices tangled up into one and were noisily heard.

‘Ah…… it’s noisy.’

Deni III shook his head with a completely annoyed expression.

At that instant, his neck felt an almost shocking sharp gaze.

He turned his head and looked at the place the four dukes were standing.

‘Hmm.’

Duke Francis Wilson was looking at him with a fierce light in his eyes.

Deni III uselessly jolted and mumbled his lips.

‘I know. I just need to act a plentily contemplating and contemplating pose.’

He soon scrunched his nose and supported his forehead on his right hand.

In anyone’s eyes, it was a look of delving deep in thought after listening to other nobles.

‘His majesty has delved into contemplation!’

‘We must persuade his majesty!’

Thanks to that, the nobles’ nettling and appeals became much worse.

At that moment.

Boom!

The grand hall’s door, which had been tightly closed, abruptly opened up.

The nobles who were noisily clamoring all closed their mouths and stared at the grand hall’s entrance.

That was also the same for Deni III, who was acting as if having fallen into contemplation, and the three princes and the four dukes, who were quietly watching the scene.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards the door.

“He, he has come.”

The one who opened the door and appeared was the captain of the palace guards, Viscount Dow Fint.

With a greatly panicked look, he was breathing out rough breaths.

It was clear that he had ran urgently.

“He? Just who is he?”

One noble who was closest to the door gruffly asked.

Dow laboriously calmed his breath and urgently opened his mouth.

“The man directly related to the current fief war, I……”

When his words reached about that point, a large shadow set behind Dow.

An old man of a bold built had appeared.

“Huph!”

“Ho, how is he here……?!”

“How is this possible?”

Suddenly, the nobles all widely opened their eyes and made shocked faces.

The old man who was receiving everyone’s gazes alone.

He cheerily smiled and stepped into the grand hall.

“It’s as if I came to a place I cannot.”

His voice was small but powerful.

The old man walked between the nobles and arrived in front of Deni III.

Chk!

He kneeled down on one knee and lowered his head.

A bold presence was felt.

“Vassal Io Lancephil, greets his majesty the king.”

The old man, he was in fact Io Lancephil.

“How, how are you here……?”

Deni III asked with a half dazed expression.

However little he had no interest in domestic politics and state of affairs, he knew well of what kind of circumstances Io was currently in.

“I have came to visit his majesty because I have words I need to tell.”

His voice was calm.

From start to finish, Io was relaxed.

It simply wasn’t a look of a man directly involved in the fief war nor that of a protagonist of the disadvantageous situation.

“Sir Count Lancephil, just how did this happen? What did you do with the fief war and come all the way to the capital, Miller? The fief war couldn’t possibly have ended already, could it?”

Simon’s right hand and the one who had close relationship even with Io, Viscount Tio Ruin asked with a stiffly solidified expression.

Many nobles twitched their ears up and awaited Io’s answer.

‘Right, we heard that more than half of the Lancephil County has already fallen into Count Chase Forces’ hands.’

‘Who know if he perhaps didn’t have the strength to endure the fief war and surrendered.’

‘Then are the words he have to tell his majesty the declaration of the end of the war?’

The faces of the nobles supporting Tommy and Kallum became infinitely bright.

On the other hand, the faces of the nobles supporting Simon was greatly dark.

Io looked long at such nobles’ expressions, then spoke in a calm voice.

“The fief war is continuing on.”

It was a short answer.

“Ah……”

Completely different exclamations flowed out from the two sides.

One side was a deep sigh, one side was a breath of relief.

Tio, with a slightly loosen face, carefully asked.

“Then what did you do with the fief war and came here, sir?”

The man who commanded the fief war and give orders to the commanders.

That was the responsibility of the fief’s lord.

But Io had thrown that away and had appeared in the capital, Miller.

Io cheerfully smiled and answered.

“Hasn’t the capital, Miller, sent out an official order with his majesty the king’s name?”

“Yes. It was an order for anyone excluding those directly related to not enter the fief war.”

Tio instantly answered.

Io faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Because of that order, I too cannot enter the fief war.”

“Eh? What do you……?”

Tio made an expression that said he couldn’t understand.

No, it wasn’t only that.

“Sir Count Lancephil, what do you mean by that?”

“What do you mean?”

“What are you saying?”

From here and there, questions mixed with perplexity poured out.

Io cheerfully smiled, then looked at Deni III.

Deni III too had a completely curious expression.

Io once again kneeled down on one knee and lowered his head.

“Vassal Io Lancephil, has passed Lancephil County together with the title to my successor.”

Boom.

In an instant, an incredible impact struck the inside of the grand hall.

Deni III as well as the three princes and all the nobles fully opened their eyes and made shocked expressions.

Being shocked too much, there was no one who spoke up a word.

After an unknown amount of time.

“Wha, what do you mean?”

“You’ve passed fief and the title?”

Tommy and Kallum asked while creasing their foreheads.

As the heavy silence shattered, questions poured down from here and there.

“What do you mean a successor?”

“You had a successor?”

“Even if you are a count, you passed down the title without the palace’s consent? This is something that goes beyond one’s authority!”

At that moment, Deni III, who was staying still, raised his right hand.

The nobles who were loudly shouting all closed their mouths.

Deni III asked in a quiet voice towards Io.

“Who is the successor you bequeathed the fief and the title to?”

It was the most central question.

Gulp.

All the nobles swallowed dry spit.

Io faintly smiled and answered.

“It is Roan Tale, your highness.”

“Ah……”

Instantly, quiet exclamations flowed out from here and there.

The reason Roan entered the fief war had finally been clearly revealed.

‘It’s a disaster.’

‘That Roan Tale will become a count?’

The light from the faces of the nobles who supported Tommy and Kallum went dark.

Whatever happened, they had to put a brake to this event.

On the other hand, the light from the faces of the nobles who supported Simon, which had been dark throughout, became unrecognizably bright.

‘It’s the case of attaching wings to a tiger.’

‘Hahaha! The work got solved much better instead!’

The mood between the nobles flipped in an instant.

At that moment, Tommy went forwards with a displeased expression.

“Sir Count Lancephil, successor selection and the bequeathment of the fief as well as the title is not something you can decide on alone. Unless it is a viscount house or a baron house, upper nobles of and above count house must receive the royal family’s consent.”

Numerous nobles nodded their heads.

Io made a cheerful smile.

“I know of that, your highness Prince Tommy.”

He continued his words as he looked long through Simon, Kalum, and Deni III.

“For selecting the successor of and above count house, one needs his majesty the king and the three princes’ consent.”

When his words continued to about that point, Simon cutted in.

“To be exact, one only needs more than two people’s consent amongst the four people.”

His look was very cautious.

It wasn’t a very good situation.

‘Even if I were to support Sir Count Lancephil……’

Tommy and Kallum would set down a wedge.

In the end, they had to be able to persuade the one card left, Deni III.

If the approval and disapproval were to be split 2 to 2, the nobles’ vote followed.

‘It’s subtle, but the number of nobles supporting me is greater.’

If it just went to the nobles’ vote, the possibility of concluding according to Simon and Io’s will was high.

‘Sir Count Lancephil, do you have the confidence?’

Simon looked at Io, who was leisurely throughout, and exhaled a short sigh.

Knowing or perhaps not knowing Simon’s such feeling, Io lowered his head towards Deni III along with a leisurely smile.

“Baron Roan Tale is an individual who has no lacking as my successor. If it is him, he will lead the Lancephil County well. Please consent the transfer of the fief and the title.”

Finally, the main topic was thrown.

Now, only Deni III, Simon, Tommy, and Kallum’s decisions were left.

Tommy went a step ahead and spoke in a resolute voice.

“I disapprove. The title of a count is not something that could be transferred so carelessly. We must take time and thoroughly check.”

At those words, the nobles who supported Tommy clapped.

“That is correct!”

“We must go through a thorough checking procedure.”

The inside of the hall momentarily became loud.

Tommy had disapproved and went up, but Io’s expression was still relaxed.

The one who went up next was Simon.

There was a need to change the mood.

“I approve. There is no one as suitable as Roan Tale anywhere else.”

As soon as his words finished, the nobles supporting Simon exploded out cheers.

“Waaaah! Right! Exactly right!”

“If it’s the hero of the expedition and the one who suppressed Elton Coat’s rebellion, Baron Roan Tale, he is more than enough to lead the county.”

Thunderous voices shook the grand hall.

Now, the ones left were Deni III and Kallum.

‘We have to secure one person’s support here.’

Kallum’s support was illogical.

In the end, they must capture Deni III’s heart.

About the moment Simon’s thoughts became complicated.

Io, who had been staying quiet, stared softly at Deni III.

“Your majesty the king.”

“Speak.”

Deni III leaned his body on the throne and shook his hand.

In truth, he wasn’t particularly satisfied with the current situation.

‘County’s successor? It doesn’t matter who it becomes.’

He merely wished to quickly end this uncomfortable and boring place.

If Francis wasn’t there, he would already had jumped and stood up from the seat.

“Vassal Io Lancephil is an old general who has roamed the battlefields since the time of the previous majesty the king. I have carried out big and small wars with the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom as well as even the Estia Empire. And after the kingdom had entered the era of peace later on, I have retired to the current Lancephil County and have given my one life to border defense. This was all an action for the prosperity of our kingdom.”

“I know well of your hard work.”

Deni III slowly nodded his head.

Io was a veteran general of hundred battlefields who had been active ever since the time he was the crown prince.

‘The previous king truly valued him.’

The king of the previous generation and the man who was Deni III’s father, Marubel Rinse was a very belligerent man.

Although he slightly lacked in politics, his strength was so outstanding that he was even called with an nickname of war king in the continent’s Northeast.

War King Marubel.

He was a true monarch of war who did not fear even the war with the Estia, which was a great empire.

Io’s words continued.

“Perhaps because he had looked kindly at such me, the previous majesty the king had left to this vassal a small present.”

“A small present?”

Deni III creased his forehead.

The other nobles were also the same.

Io did not mind and took out a blue silk about a size of a palm from his bosom.

“What could that be?”

“What is it?”

The whispering voices gradually became bigger.

Io carefully untied and opened the silk.

Within the silk, a small box made of wood was inside.

Click.

When he opened the lid, a ring embedded with a five-colored gem showed itself.

“Ah……”

Quiet gasps flowed out from here and there.

There was almost no one amongst the nobles within the grand hall who had personally seen that ring.

But everyone knew of the ring’s identity.

The object that one could not absolutely not know of if one was the Rinse Kingdom’s royalty or a noble.

“The War King’s ring!”

Deni III shouted with a completely shocked expression.

The War King’s Ring was the ring the previous king Marubel Rinse had made right before he died, and was known to be a total of five.

Marubel had shared those five rings with the retainers he trusted and valued, but had actually kept thoroughly and completely silent of the identities of the retainers who received the rings.

But, in the case of the owner of the ring were to appear, he had separately left a will before he died to absolutely accept the ring owner’s request unless the request was of making the royal family and the kingdom’s fate perilous.

Additionally, he left together even a will to treat the ring’s owner as the senior of the royal family.

“Yes, the War King’s Ring is correct.”

Io faintly smiled and lowered his head.

In an instant, a silence fell inside the grand hall.

‘Th, the War King’s Ring……’

‘So one of those five retainers was Count Lancephil!’

‘Ah…… this is something completely unexpected.’

The nobles were half-dazed out of their minds.

That was also the same for Edwin Voisa, Bradley Webster, Liss Kowan, and Francis Wilson.

‘Hohoho, the War King’s Ring…… finally, that damned object has revealed itself.’

‘Anyhow, has one of the ring’s owner revealed himself……’

‘With things done like this, would this matter flow according to Io’s will? No, even if his majesty approves, it is a 2 against 2 situation. If it goes to the nobles’ votes, we can place a wedge once again.’

‘The War King’s Ring……’

The each’s different and complicated thoughts tangled and entwined.

That was also the same for Deni III.

‘To see the War King’s Ring again…… because of King father who passed on, my head hurts just simply too much.’

Even without that, he already knew one of the ring owner.

A very tiring and painful ring owner.

For some reason, he felt like he was feeling a sharp gaze.

With a false cough, Deni III slowly nodded his head.

“Count Io Lancephil, I haven’t expected for you to have the War King’s Ring.”

Io merely smiled and did not say any word.

Deni III exhaled out a short sigh.

“You probably plan to request me to approve the fief and the title’s transfer with that, right? But it isn’t as if the transfer will be decided just because I approved.”

If Kallum disapproves and step up, the approval and the disapproval would become 2 against 2.

Even after using the War King’s Ring, he couldn’t certainly finish the matter.

“I know, your majesty.”

Io answered with a composed voice.

In the first place, he planned to contend for the victory in the nobles’ vote.

‘If we just get to the nobles’ vote, there is a plenty chance to win.’

Deni III creased his brows.

“You will use the War King’s Ring even while knowing that? Wouldn’t it be better to request to stop the fief war instead? If so, I could make Count Chase fall back with my authority.”

That was a truth.

Unlike the fief and title transfer, stopping the fief war or making Count Jonathan Chase fall back was something Deni III could decide even alone.

But Io shook his head.

“I cannot use the War King’s Ring on such a petty matter.”

Because of his own lacking, his retainers betrayed him and attached themselves to Count Chase Forces.

It was a truly embarrassing thing even with just that.

But he couldn’t request to pull away the enemies because it was difficult to fight them.

It was Io, the man amongst men and a veteran of hundred battles’ last pride.

“Hohoho, a petty matter is it……”

Deni III exploded out a hearty laugh.

His eyes flashed and shone a light.

“Alright, the ring’s value really is just that great. Then, is transferring the fief and the title to Roan Tale something suitable to the ring’s value?”

As soon as the question ended, Io answered in a brave and powerful voice.

“The value of Roan Tale is beyond that of the War King’s Ring.”

Boom.

Once again, a great impact stormed within the grand hall.

Roan’s value is higher than that of the War King’s Ring the previous king Marubel had left?

If not careful, it could be heard like a statement insulting the royal family.

“Hohoho.”

Deni III popped out a hearty laugh once again.

‘As expected, Io is Io, is it? He is enough to have received King Father’s ring.’

He looked straight into Io’s eyes and nodded his head.

“Good. The will of the his majesty the previous king’s will is held within the War King’s Ring. I take on the previous king’s will and approve the transfer of Count Lancephil’s fief and the title.”

Finally, Deni III made the difficult decision.

With this, the ones who approved the transfer were two, and the one who disapproved was one.

Simon and Io inwardly shouted and cheered.

‘Alright. Even if Kallum says to disapprove, we can go all the way to the nobles’ vote.’

‘Thankfully, the matter is resolving in the way we desired.’

Bright smiles hung even on the faces of the nobles who supported Simon.

Of course, they weren’t being unguarded.

The vote was literally a vote.

Until the result came out, they could never relax.

The nobles supporting Tommy and Kallum gritted their teeth.

‘Right, it’s still too soon to give up.’

‘How much we persuade the neutral faction nobles is important.’

‘The victory and loss hasn’t been decided yet.’

At that moment.

“Kallu, now only you are left.”

Deni III gestured towards Kallum.

Kallum, who had been silently watching the situation, went forwards.

Already, Simon, Tommy, and the nobles who followed them were raising plans to how to set the vote that would follow.

There was no one who gave any attention to Kallum.

Kallum looked long around at them and spoke up with a low voice.

“I, of Sir Count Lancephil’s transfer of the fief and the title……”

The end of his voice slightly trembled.

His expression too was dark.

However, there was no one who noticed this.

No one had any interest in Kallum’s words.

It was because they thought that he would disapprove anyway.

Finally, Kallum gave his decision.

“I, of Sir Count Lancephil’s transfer of the fief and the title…… approve it.”

Boom.

An incredible impact greater than any impact until now stormed through the great hall.

Simon, Tommy, and the many nobles who were preparing the nobles’ vote completely opened their eyes and made shocked expressions.

Deni III and Io as well as the kingdom’s four dukes’ expressions were that of having completely not expected.

“Ka, Kallum!”

“Prince! What are you saying!”

“Wha, what do you mean approve!”

Tommy and the nobles rushed up towards Kallum like a swarm of bees.

Deni III, who took a hold of his mind a moment late, asked once again.

“Wha, what did you say? You will approve? Is that true?”

At the repeated question, the people focused on Kallum’s answer.

Kallum, while feeling the gazes pouring down on him, slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. I approve the transfer of the fief and the title.”

It was an answer like the before.

“Ah……”

“Ju, just how did this……”

Tommy and the nobles who supported him were of course, and even the nobles supporting Kallum threw up deep moans.

Simon and the nobles who supported him did not carelessly delight at it and observed Kallum’s movements.

‘What are you scheming, Kallum.’

With sharp eyes, Simon glared at Kallum’s eyes.

Kallum quietly stared at that gaze and made a bitter smile.

‘Roan Tale, you truly are a horrifying man.’

He thought up the event that happened last winter.

‘It was right after he came back as Pershion Kingdom’s secret envoy.’

The day the diplomatic relation between the Rinse Kingdom and the Pershion Kingdom, which had been cut off, was connected once again.

That night, Roan came to his mansion.

Carrying stories that were difficult to bear.

Enter the War (2) End.

Chapter 165




T/n: Tuesday Chapter. Sorry about the missed Sunday’s chapter. I’ve been a bit busy cramming for the driver’s license test. I’ll make sure to make it up this week, and hopefully the sponsored chapter too.

It was something completely unexpected.

“Roan Tale. For you to come find me……”

Kallum Rinse looked straight into Roan’s eyes, who was sitting on the other side.

Roan faintly smiled and raised his teacup.

“The tea’s fragrance is good.”

“Stop with the nonsense. For what reason did you come find me?”

Kallum found Roan awkward.

No, he was unpleasant, annoying, and enraging.

‘If it wasn’t only for this bastard……’

By now, the one who was going ahead in the throne succession competition would surely had been him.

Obviously, there was no way his mood was good.

At Kallum’s intimidation, Roan put down the cup and answered.

“I came to visit because I have words I need to tell your highness.”

“To me?”

Kallum creased his forehead.

“Yes.”

Roan nodded his head and took out a small envelope from his chest pocket.

It was a rather weighty looking envelope.

“What is that?”

At the completely sharp question, Roan took out tens of letters from within the envelope.

Instantly, Kallum’s face laughably twisted.

“Those are……”

The tens of letters.

They were the secret and ugly letters that Kallum had shared with Elton Coat and Reitas Pershion.

The stories of him trying to kill Simon using Elton and the stories of him using Reitas to kill Roan were meticulously written.

The tip of his fingers sharply trembled.

‘Yes. I knew a day like this would come some day……’

In truth, the puzzled feeling inside him was great until now.

From looking at Roan’s actions, it was obvious that he had obtained the letters he shared with Elton and Reitas.

But despite that, no exposure, blackmail, placation, leak, or anything happened.

He tried to passed it off as Roan’s personality, but the nervous feeling couldn’t be helped.

‘If these letters are revealed……’

The moment his thought led to that point.

As if he had read Kallum’s thought, Roan threw the same question.

“What do you think would happen if those letters are revealed, your highness?”

Kallum didn’t answer.

No, he couldn’t.

Roan cheerfully smiled and continued his words.

“It won’t end with merely being ousted from the throne succession competition. If the fact that Prince Kallum was behind Elton Coat’s rebellion, it is obvious that you will receive a heavy punishment. At the very least, you will receive exilement.”

It was the truth.

The kingdom was silent of the veiled and political strifes under the name of throne succession competition, but the story would change if a royalty were to shed blood.

Because of that, even Simon Rinse, who currently had built the largest faction, couldn’t carelessly harm Tommy and Kallum.

If the truth that Kallum tried to assassinate Simon was revealed in such situation, he would receive exilement at the very least, or be jailed or be banishment out of the kingdom at the extreme.

“Are you threatening me?”

Kallum glared at Roan with glowing and blazing eyes.

Roan shook his head.

“Rather than a threat, but I wish to negotiate.”

“Negotiate?”

At the unexpected words, Kallum creased his forehead.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Yes. Please listen to one request of mine. If you answer the request, then I will get rid of these letters.”

“A request…… what kind of request is it?”

Kallum was cautious.

Roan, with a composed look, answered.

“Who knows. I’m not sure of that yet, sir. If something I need to request comes up, I will tell you then.”

Kallum’s plot to assassinate Simon wasn’t a small case.

He couldn’t half-heartedly or impetuously use it.

“But in return, I won’t ask for a ridiculous request or a one that needs to touch blood.”

“Hmm……”

Kallum leaked a quiet groan.

If he could, I wished to immediately kick off his seat and slap the side of his face once.

But currently, he was thoroughly standing in the position of the disadvantaged, no, of the loser.

There was neither the strength nor justification to refuse nor defy.

But even so, the one strand of pride he had left twitched.

“Even though I could attack you right now and take those letters?”

At those words, Roan formed a faint smile.

“Do you truly think that is possible, your highness?”

His attitude was truly confident and bold.

In a way, it was a truly arrogant statement.

However, Kallum couldn’t readily refute.

‘If I mobilize the knights and attack, I would easily be able to kill him, but……’

Inevitably, an incredible noise would arise and all the gazes of the capital, Miller, would become focused.

In Kallum’s position, it wasn’t quite an agreeable situation.

With a short sigh, he glared at Roan.

“In you bastard’s position, would it not be much better to reveal those letters? Since I would then be ousted from the throne succession competition, and Tommy too would not be Simon’s match if I were to be ousted. The moment the letters are revealed, throne succession competition would end and Simon would be appointed the Grand Duke of Grain, but why do you make the matter complicated?”

His voice asked as if to bite.

It was an attitude seemingly telling him to reveal the letters instead if he planned to played with him.

Roan faintly smiled as he shook his head.

“Who knows. Perhaps it’s possible that……”

His eyes flashed and shone a light.

“I wish for it to become complicated.”

“Hm? Wish for it to become complicated? What do you mean?”

Kallum creased his forehead.

“Perhaps, do you not wish for Simon to climb up to the Grand Duke of Grain?”

At those words, Roan shook his head.

“I have never said those words, sir. Anyhow, the important thing right now……”

He lightly shook the letters he was holding.

“Is the negotiation between Prince Kallum and me.”

The instant his words finished, Kallum snorted.

“Hmph. Can you even call something like this a negotiation?”

“Who knows. It depends on how one thinks.”

Roan lightly answered, then stared straight into Kallum’s eyes.

Kallum quietly stared at that gaze, then nodded his head.

“Can’t be helped. Since I don’t have the right to choose. For now, I will only be able to follow your wish. But……”

The outline of his eyes became sharp.

“How do I trust you? Could you really be able to get rid of those letters? Since in your position, those letters would be the same as a master key.”

By just having that, he could control him as much as he wished.

‘Of course, I also have no plan to keep being played by that act……’

Kallum tightly clenched his fist.

‘A rat in a corner will bite a cat.’

If Roan kept blackmailing him with those letters as a weapon, he could only go out on a counterattack without caring for before nor after.

‘Since being pushed aside in the throne competition would be the same this way or that.’

At the rage that soared up, his entire body sharply trembled.

“I know well that Prince Kallum isn’t someone who will always be swung around as wished. Just once, you simply need to listen to my request just once, sir.”

Roan knew how to handle Kallum.

He stared straight into Kallum’s eyes.

“Because it didn’t seem that Prince would trust me, I have devised one solution.”

“What is it?”

Kallum thinly opened his eyes.

With a composed voice, Roan answered.

“The locker of erasure.”

“The locker of erasure? You must mean the Delerium magic.”

Delerium magic.

Activating when certain conditions are fulfilled, it usually was a magic used when storing documents or objects for a certain amount of time.

Roan nodded his head and took out a wooden box about two-hands big out of a small bag.

“It is the locker of erasure enchanted with the Delerium magic, sir. I will place Prince’s letters here.”

His voice was still composed.

“I will set the time setting to one year. Whether I request or not, the letters within the locker will be erased on their own once the one year passes.”

Roan continued to add on.

“If I give a request within the one year, and if Prince would listen to it, I will give you this locker’s key.”

The key wasn’t important.

Since the letters would be erased anyhow once the one year passed.

“For the wooden locker, Prince, please keep it.”

“Hmm.”

Kallum leaked a low groan.

It was an excessively good condition than he had thought.

“You will leave this to me? Even though I would then immediately destroy this?”

Roan nodded his head as if saying it did not matter.

“It is fine even if you do so. But after the locker’s magic is activated, a spell is enchanted so that it would teleport on its own if touched or receives an impact without permission. It is set to move to the place I have selected.”

“How meticulous.”

Kallum twisted his lips.

‘Either way, it isn’t such a bad offer.’

He couldn’t trust Roan, but he could trust the locker of erasure.

But there was one thing he couldn’t understand.

‘Even if I would not be swung as he wish, those letters are definitely the same as cards of certain victory. Why would he make the matter complicated even by using the locker of erasure?’

The light in Kallum’s eyes calmed down.

‘Does the guy truly not wish for Simon to become the next king?’

If so.

‘Who is the next king he wishes for?’

Kallum continued on his soliloquy of questions and answers.

‘Perhaps me? Is that why he is trying to erase his debt to me?‘

If so, even though it was wrong, it was a much too incorrect thought.

‘Since the feeling of abhorrence towards him is greater than the feeling of gratefulness. ‘

With the matter this time, such feelings became much stronger.

The very day the locker’s letters disappeared, Kallum planned to mobilize all his strength to rush and corner him.

At that moment.

“Then, I will place the letter inside the locker of erasure.”

Roan placed the letters of ugly contents into the locker and activated the magic.

From the entirety of the locker, a bright light shone out.

“I will leave the locker here, sir.”

Roan opened Kallum’s large desk drawer and placed the locker inside it.

As if it had been waiting, the light disappeared.

“From now on, you cannot carelessly touch it, sir. Since it would be teleported that instant.”

“I know.”

Kallum answered with his forehead creased.

Suddenly, there was a single thought that brushed past his mind.

‘Even though the locker of erasure itself is a greatly precious object, he even placed a teleport spell on it?’

To make that degree of an object, the skill of at least the palace magician’s level was needed to be possible.

Kallum’s face stiffly solidified.

‘Where did the bastard obtain such an object?’

The Rinse Kingdom’s current palace magician had barred himself within a magic tower and was focusing on research.

Kallum as well as anyone, including Simon and Tommy, couldn’t meet him.

‘Then it means that it wasn’t our side’s palace magician, but…… ah!’

Suddenly, a fire lighted with a flash within his head.

There was one place that Roan could obtain the locker of erasure, a one with even a teleport spell attached onto that.

‘Pershion Kingdom!’

Kallum glaringly opened his eyes.

‘This bastard……’

The inside of his head became complicated.

‘This event right now wasn’t done impulsively. At the very least, he had schemed this event from since the Pershion Kingdom. That means……’

It meant that even the request he was going to ask of him was more or less roughly outlined.

‘It wouldn’t be an easy request.’

The inside of his mouth was newly covered bitter.

“Then, I will now leave, your highness.”

Roan carefully closed the desk drawer and lowered his head.

His look was still relaxed and composed.

In front of the reception room’s door, he softly stared at Kallum.

“On the day I present my request, a small bird will tap on Prince’s window.”

Kallum did not say any words.

Like that, Roan once again said his goodbye and disappeared himself.

This was the whole story of the secretive meeting that had happened last winter.

‘And exactly yesterday, a small bird tapped on my window.’

The thing the bird had passed was a single short letter.

‘It was a content instructing to approve the transfer of the Count House’s fief and title.’

As according to the threat, no, negotiation, Kallum answered Roan’s request.

“Prince! Just why……”

“This is a case of attaching wings to Baron Tale!”

“Prince! Prince Kallum!”

The nobles’ outcries hit his ears.

However, Kallum did not show any reaction.

With his statement of approval, Count Io Lancephil’s desire was much too easily fulfilled.

The inside of the grand hall became greatly noisy.

‘Simon. You bastard too should better be careful. Because Roan is much more deceitful bastard than you think.’

Kallum glared at Simon once, then moved his steps.

“Kallum!”

Tommy Rinse called Kallum a moment late.

However, kallum instead hurried his steps and exited out the grand hall.

He soon rode a carriage and headed to his mansion.

‘Is everything now over?’

His expression was complicated.

Rage and annoyance, alleviation and relief were mixed.

“Anyhow, how do I receive the key?”

Either way, the locker’s letters would be erased once the one year passed.

But even so, since he had answered Roan’s request, he needed to receive the locker’s key as promised.

‘Would that bastard personally come?’

In front of his eyes, Roan’s face floated up.

Uddk.

His teeth grinded instinctively.

‘I will definitely pay you back this humiliation of today.’

His desire for revenge blazed up.

Meanwhile, the carriage arrived at the mansion.

“Anyone came to find me?”

At the head butler who came to greet him, he threw a sharp question.

The head butler, with a flustered look, shook his head.

“There was none, sir.”

The head butler answered with a flustered look.

“There was none?”

Kallum pushed aside the retainers who caught up, then quickly headed to the reception room.

‘Do you perhaps plan to break your promise?’

The inside of the reception room was completely empty.

A musty smell pierced his nose.

At that moment.

“Un?”

Kallum’s eyes opened wide.

On the cleanly organized desk.

On top of it, an unfamiliar key was there.

It was a crude key shining with a bronze light.

“Perhaps……”

Kallum, with the key in his hand, carefully opened the drawer the locker was in.

With a slightly nervous expression, he fitted the key into the locker’s hole.

Click.

With a pleasant metallic sound, the locker opened.

Suddenly, a light flashed from the locker’s entirety.

At the same time, the softly felt flow of mana disappeared.

It was the erasure of the magic array.

Kallum tightly bit his lower lips, and opened the locker’s lid.

The letters that had tied him were seen.

“Kuuk!”

Forcefully swallowing back the curses that reached his throat, Kallum ripped apart the letters.

It was the instant the shackles that had bound him disappeared.

“Huu. Huu. Huu.”

Rough breaths poured out like breathes in winter.

Kallum placed the key in his hand on top of the desk.

“Is there anyone outside!”

Frost like pressure extended out.

Soon, the reception room’s door opened and one escort knight showed himself.

“Was there no one who entered this place?”

At the question that asked, the knight lowered hish head.

“Yes. There was no one, your highness.”

“There was no one?”

“Yes. There was no one. After Prince’s order last winter, not even the maids and servants who cleans had entered. Many knights, including me, have been guarding without a single crack for water to leak.”

His voice was full of certainty.

Kallum looked at the knight and exhaled a short sight.

“Without a single crack for water to leak, is it……”

It was speechlessly absurd.

Kallum couldn’t hold himself back and slammed the desk.

Boom!

A deafening boom rang out.

‘Roan!’

Rage boiled up.

‘From now on is truly the start.’

A cold light hung on his eyes.

‘I will definitely twist apart your four limbs!’

It was a declaration of war that was said alone.

Enter the War (165) End.

Chapter 166




T/n: Late Saturday chapter. Next chapter will be up in few hours.

“Damn it! Just what is this mess!”

The legion commander Donald of Kapeo Legion, the Count Chase Forces’ temporary legion, roughly swung the commander’s baton he held.

His face was flushed red.

He was in a greatly annoyed and enraged state.

“Are you telling me they are some sort of ghosts?”

A thunder like roar exploded out.

The adjutants and troop commanders lined up on each sides cowered and shrunk back.

“Four troops were annihilated in the last three days. And they were all done in by raids and ambush tactics! That means they know thoroughly where we are, where we are going, what we are doing, and everything!”

Shiing.

He suddenly drew out his sword.

The sharp blade pointed at the adjutants and troop commanders one after another.

“Is it you? You? Are you those bastards’ spy? You bastard is Roan Tale’s nark, right?”

Madness.

His reasonings had became blurred due to a foul rage.

Donald was rotting his brain due to Roan and the Tale Legion that were effortlessly roaming all over the Lancephil Fief’s western region in the last few days.

“Hiii! It, it isn’t me, sir!”

“It’s not me either!”

“I, it’s absolutely not me, sir!”

The adjutants and the troop commanders shook their hands with bleached white faces.

Donald yelled as he sprayed spit this way and that way.

“Damn it! Then are you telling me that Roan Tale really is a ghost or something!”

The sound of angry shout shook the tent’s inside.

At that moment, one of the troop commanders whom falteringly stepped back untactfully spoke up.

“Originally, Baron Tale’s nickname was the ghost of the battlefield. Since the Pedian Plain Monster Expedition, he found the monsters’ locations and nests really well that he was almost like a fortune tel……”

When his words reached about that point.

Spat!

Donald glared his eyes and swung his sword.

Ssskuk!

With a horrifying sound, the neck of the troop commander who rattled off pointless sounds fell down.

Along with a fountain of blood, the body that had been hard hollowly collapsed.

“Why is this son of bitch talking back!”

Donald, with a thick spit, spat out a curse.

He glared at the completely tense expressions of the adjutants and the troop commanders and crunched his nose.

“Roan Tale, that son of a bitch has grasped our every single little movements, but we don’t know where that bastard is now, where he is going, where his goal is, or anything. We don’t know anything I tell you!”

The blood-stained tip of the sword moved as if to dance.

“You sons of bitches! Don’t just mindlessly stand there and go catch that bastard! No, at least find out where he is!”

The cold roar hit the ears.

The adjutants and the troop commanders saluted with completely nervous expressions.

“Ye, yes! Understood, sir!”

“We, we will definitely find out, sir!”

It was the moment they were just about to exit out of the tent.

“Sir Legion Commander!”

With a daring voice, a middle aged man showed himself.

It was one of the Kapeo Legion’s troop commander Babel.

Donald, who was glaring at the adjutants and the troop commanders, creased his forehead.

“What is it?”

His voice was angry as if the tip of the sword would immediately dance.

But Babel, unlike the other adjutants and the troop commanders, didn’t became afraid nor cowered.

He brightly smiled and spoke in a polite voice.

“We finally found it.”

At the abruptly spat out words, Donald scrunched his forehead.

“What do you mean you found it?”

The other adjutants and troop commanders too leaned their ears at Babel’s words.

Their expressions were all confused.

Babel grinned and answered.

“We found Tale Legion’s camp.”

Suddenly, a bright smile hung on Donald’s face that had been cold.

“Ooh!”

A peculiar sound exploded out.

He threw away the sword he was holding and grabbed Babel’s shoulder.

“Is that true?”

“Yes. During a patrol of the nearby region, we discovered the Tale Legion that was moving. When we quietly followed their backs……”

“And there was the camp?”

“Yes. We didn’t go close in case of being discovered, but we ascertained at least from afar. It definitely is Tale Legion’s camp.”

He spoke in a bold voice.

Donald brightly smiled as he nodded his head.

“Kukuku. Babel. You raised a big achievement.”

“I have merely done my best to the mission I received, sir.”

Babel lowered his head with a bloody smile.

Donald patted Babel’s shoulder and breathed in deeply.

“Good! Immediately prepare to march! We will go and destroy the Tale Legion!”

Strength overflowed in his voice.

“Let’s also give them the sharp taste of a raid attack. Kukuku.”

“Yes! Understood!”

The adjutants and the troop commanders answered in one voice, then ran out of the tent.

A sense of relief at having let go of a worry floated up on their faces.

A moment later.

Dudududududu!

With the sound of horse hooves, the Kapeo Legion marched towards the South.

They ran on top of a wide plain and soon entered a field of hills.

“Tale Legion’s camp is located within the forests spread out blew there, sir.”

Babel pointed at a forest that widely spread below the hills.

It was a denser forest than they had thought.

“Inside the forest?”

Donald asked with a puzzled expression.

Understandably, it was because, from a glance, no space enough to set up a camp was seen inside the forest.

Babel cheerily smiled and answered.

“From here, it looks like a river is flowing right behind the forest, but in fact, there is a rather wide space between the forest and the river. It’s a hard place to discover before directly going inside and seeing.”

“Hmm.”

Donald, with a slightly surprised expression, nodded his head.

“I haven’t even thought that such a furtive place was in a place like this.”

“Right. We couldn’t find the bastards because it’s like that.”

Unsightly excuses continued on.

Suddenly.

“It’s the Tale Legion.”

Babel once again pointed below the hill.

Donald and the troop commanders all lowered their bodies.

Dudududududu.

A sound of horse hooves noisily rang.

A portion troop of the Tale Legion rapidly raced towards the forest.

“It looks like a troop returning to the camp, sir.”

At Babel’s words, Donald nodded his head.

“Certainly, it seems that the camp is inside there.”

A handful of doubt that was left flew away as if washed off.

Donald sinisterly smiled and looked at the troop commanders.

“Pierce through the forest in one breath and raid the bastards’ camp.”

“Yes! Understood!”

A resounding sound of answer followed.

“Kukuku. Now is the time for us to push those bastards.”

A monstrous laugh bursted out.

Soon, the preparation to rush was set.

Donald glared at the forest and threw his sword.

“Today we cut Roan Tale’s neck!”

The loud voice hit the ears.

He soon powerfully kicked the horse’s stomach.

“Charge!”

As soon as the command was given, the Kapeo Legion became a single lump and began to charge.

Dudududududu!

The sound of shaking the ground rang out.

A dust cloud thickly flew up.

The vanguard entered the forest first. Donald and the main forces followed behind the. The forest was much wider than they saw from the outside.

To the left and the right, the ends couldn’t be seen.

The one good point at least was that it was easy to ride the horses because there was quite a space inside the forest.

‘So they could set up a camp at a space inside the forest region because it’s like this.’

It was a place that the march of the entire force was possible in emergency.

Donald made a sinister smile.

If the Babel kid hadn’t stepped on the Tale Legion’s tail, they would never have been able to discover the camp inside the forest.

Hwaa!

Suddenly, the trees that had dizzily filled his sight disappeared.

Simultaneously, an area wider than he had thought showed up.

They had finally pierced through the forest.

A gigantic camp that even neatly raised fences showed itself.

‘Righto!”

Donald inwardly shouted in cheer and raised his sword up high.

“The bastards haven’t discovered us yet! Push them like a storm!”

Spirits boiled up.

‘Roan Tale! Do you know how much we suffered because of you bastards!’

‘Tale Legion. This here will be you bastards’ graves!’

‘I’ll kill you all!’

The Kapeo Legion’s adjutants and the troop commanders remembered the sorrow they took from Donald until then, and clenched their teeth.

“Charge!”

“Charge! Kill them all!”

Yells mixed with pent-up angers pierced the sky.

Dudududududu.

The sound of horse hooves was heard much rougher.

Perhaps because of the spirit that rose to his heart’s content, Donald soon stood at the head and was leading a troop.

The camp’s fences were seen in front of his eyes.

“Charge!”

With the command, the war horses rammed the fences.

Boom! Kwakwang!

With a sound of explosion, the camp’s fences that had identified the border pleasantly broke apart.

No, it broke apart much too easily than they had thought.

“Kuhahaha! Tale Legion bastards! You will need to learn how to raise camp fences again!”

Donald exploded out a crazed laugh and kicked his horse’s stomach.

They planned to storm Tale Legion’s camp in a single breath.

But.

“Hhm?”

Right after charging into the camp, he realized that something was wrong.

‘There’s nothing?’

Donald’s face solidified stiffly.

Inside the fences that easily broke apart.

The neatly raised tents they saw from the outside were all.

Behind that, lumps of grass were piled up instead of the tents.

‘Something is wrong!’

Goosebumps rose behind his neck.

‘It’s ridiculous that there is nothing. We saw a Tale Legion’s troop that entered here just before, right? Where did those bastards go?’

An ominous air swept up.

His skin ached sharply.

“Stop! Stop! All forces stop!”

Donald yelled at the top of his throat.

But the Kapeo Legion that had pulled up their spirits to their heart’s content wasn’t able to easily stop.

The troops behind continued to push the troops ahead.

“Stop!”

“I said stop!”

“Why would you suddenly stop?”

“Eh! Eh! Eh! Don’t push!”

The front and the back became dizzily tangled.

Meanwhile, the vanguard including Donald was pushed past the lumps of grass to a deeper place.

“You idiotic sons of bitches! Didn’t you hear the order to sto……”

When his words reached about that point.

“Le, Legion Commander sir!”

Babel widely opened his eyes and shouted.

With a shaking and trembling finger, he pointed at the river that was set behind.

Donald, with eyes asking just why was he doing that, slowly turned his head.

Soon, the scenery of the river came in his eyes.

Ggiiiik.

Simultaneously, sound of wood twisting hit the ears.

“Ah……”

Donald fully opened his mouth and popped out a quiet exclamation.

From the east side course of the river that had been hidden behind the forest, ten warships showed themselves.

They were warships whose hulls and the sails that rose high too were all red.

Kapeo Legion’s soldiers all became dazed.

At the center sail of the warship that was most ahead amongst the fleet.

Above that, a great flag flapped.

Tale Legion.

Poskein Navy.

The warships were Tale Legion’s ships.

They, who had received Roan’s order and had been continuing the Poskein Lake Subjugation, had suddenly appeared in the Lancephil fief.

Donald’s face comically twisted.

“Damn it! It’s a trap! We fell into a trap! Retreat! Retreat!”

The words were yelled as loudly as he could.

But already, they were as completely caught in the trap as possible.

Ssweaaaaak!

A frightening and sharp sound of impacts hit the ears.

The legion’s soldiers, including Donald, all turned their gazes towards the sky.

The arrows darkly flew towards them.

The Poskein Navy’s ships sprayed out a rain of arrows.

“Ru, ru, run!”

Donald yelled out the shout and turned his horse.

He uncaringly trampled the friendly soldiers hit by the feet as he ran.

At that instant.

Pububububuk!

A rain of arrows pour down on the fake camp full of lumps of grass.

And they were red fire arrows that blazingly burned at that.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

The Kapeo Legion’s soldiers became porcupines.

However, that wasn’t the end.

Fwooosh!

The fire arrows threw out sparks of flame, and the sparks swallowed the lumps of grass.

The flame, with a maddening force, increased its power.

“S, step back!”

“Run!”

The adjutants, troop commander, and the soldiers all tangled up into one and walked backwards.

However, the Kapeo Legion’s formation had already fallen down.

The retreat wasn’t easy.

In the end, the soldiers including the vanguard who were pushed until deep into the camp were all swallowed and eaten by the scarlet flame.

“Damn it! Damn it! You bitch like bastards!”

Donald kicked his horse’s stomach and spat out curses.

There wasn’t a time to stop even a little.

Pubububububuk!

The Poskein Navy were continuing to fire out fire arrows.

Each time, the flame spread out with a seemingly crazed force.

“Uaaaak!”

“Sa, save me!”

The Kapeo Legion’s soldiers yelled crazed shouts while caught on fire all over their bodies.

However, Donald did not care at all.

To him, the important things were his own life and safety.

In no time, the forest region was right in front of his nose.

‘I lived! I lived!’

When he looked around, at least almost half the soldiers were following his back.

‘I’ll organized the legion and counterattack agai……’

When his thought reached about that point.

Piing! Ping! Ping!

With unpleasant sounds, the thickets greatly shook.

Simultaneously, hundreds of arrows cut across the space and flew towards them.

Pubububuk!

The Kapeo Legion’s soldiers, who had been retreating in a defenseless state, helplessly fell down at the sudden arrow attack.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

The war horses and the soldiers struck the ground as if falling down flat.

At that instant.

“Charge!”

“Charge forwards!”

“Waaaaah!”

With a resounding roar, a single troop jumped out from within the forest.

Tale Legion.

Roan Tale.

Amaranth Troop.

The flag that rose straight showed off its splendor.

But the one that flaunted an even greater splendor than that was.

“Donald Kapeo!”

The man standing at the head and fiercely racing towards them shouted in a resounding voice.

The sight of a crimson armor and slantly raising a black spear.

It was Roan.

“You, you are?”

Donald crumpled his forehead.

His face brightly flushed.

Roan raised his spear up high and shouted.

“I am that very Roan Tale!”

It was an incredible spirit.

Roan’s surroundings as well as the entire battlefield’s mood heated up in an instant.

“Waaaah!”

“We are that very Tale Legion!”

With the thousand-man rank commanders at the head, the Tale Legion’s soldiers rushed the Kapeo Legion with a force like a riptide.

Boom! Kwakang!

With a sound of an explosion, the Kapeo Legion’s soldiers bounced off everywhere.

The strength of the Tale Legion, which had the Taemusas at the head, overwhelmed the strength of the Kapeo Legion, which was a temporary legion.

Furthermore, Count Chase Forces hadn’t experienced any particular battles for a few years.

Compared to that, the Tale Legion, which had the 7th Corp Rose Troop as its previous body, were veterans who had countlessly taken on thick and heavy battles from the Pedian Plain Monster Expedition, the war with the Istel Kingdom, Poskein Exodus, Suppression of Elton Coat’s Rebellion, and even the Poskein Lake Subjugation.

Furthermore.

“Vanguard don’t go ahead! From the 1st Hundred-man Squad to the 4th Hundred-man Squad, to the right!”

“Addis Troop detour to the left and attack the enemy’s side!”

“Archer Troop ready!”

“Raise the Parma! We are breaking the enemy formation!”

Unlike the Kapeo Legion which still used the organization made up of legion and troops, the communication and execution of the commands of the Tale Legion, which used a new organization following three-thousand-man troop, thousand-man troop, hundred-man squad, and ten-man squad, were greatly quick and precise.

Thanks to that, they were able to react and move like a single body even while the chaotic fights spread.

“Uak!”

“Kuuuk!”

The Kapeo Legion’s soldiers powerlessly fell.

The Tale Legion’s soldiers at the front, and the scarlet flame at the back engulfed them.

With the front and the back tightly blocked, they lost their lives one after another.

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!”

Donald spat out curses and glared at Roan.

“You bitch like bastard!”

Donald recklessly raced towards Roan.

His look was one with its reasoning lost.

Roan faintly smiled and kicked his horse’s stomach.

Spat!

The Travias Spear extended long in an instant.

When he twisted his wrist, the spearhead cut the space.

“Hph!”

Donald completely became tense at Roan’s attack, then soon made a sinister smile.

‘Is it an empty swing?’

A look of jeering was plain on his eyes.

“Now it’s my turn. Kukuku.”

At Donald’s words, Roan formed a faint smile.

“Regrettably, it seems I won’t be able to see your skill.”

His voice was composed.

Donald creased his forehead.

“What does that……”

However, his words couldn’t continue on any longer.

Following a line of his neck, a red line was drawn.

At the same time, his sight in front of his eyes twisted.

“Kkuruk.”

With a sound of blood boiling, Donald’s neck fell down onto the ground.

Roan’s attack that he thought was an empty swing, in actuality, was extremely quick that he couldn’t even see it with his eyes.

When the mana that remained when he cut the line of the neck disappeared, the head that was barely attached fell a moment late.

Roan stabbed Donald’s head with the tip of his spear.

“Roan Tale has cut off the enemy commander Kapeo’s head!”

A sonorous voice rang the battlefield.

“Waaaaah!”

“Roan Tale! Roan Tale!”

The Tale Legion’s soldiers poured out cheers.

Their spirits boiled up further.

The Kapeo Legion’s soldiers, who were barely holding on, lost their will to fight.

Like that, the battle raced towards the end.

*****

“It’s a complete victory, sir.”

Austin looked at the battlefield with a proud expression.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Make a fake camp, lure in the enemy, and annihilate them. It was truly an excellent strategy, sir.”

Austin raised and showed his thumb.

Roan merely smiled wordlessly.

Understandably because.

‘This too is one of Ian Phillip’s strategies.’

Roan had coincidentally found a suitable location and had brought and used Ian’s strategy once again.

Furthermore, this wasn’t the end of Ian’s strategy.

“Austin, prepare for the next battle.”

“Yes sir. I have already given the orders, even to the thousand-man commanders.”

Austin once again made an impressed expression.

It was because the strategy that would follow was also, from his position, was greatly weird.

‘He isn’t simply outstanding in strength. His strategies and tactics too are eminent.’

His eyes shone light of admiration and awe.

Roan needlessly found that light uncomfortable and made an awkward smile.

Austin stared at that sight for a moment, then soon lowered his head.

“Then I will also go away for now and make preparation for battle, sir.”

“Alright. Do so as you said.”

Roan inwardly exhaled a short sigh and nodded his head.

Austin saluted, then returned to his troop.

Roan quietly stood and stared at the battlefield.

‘Semi we left at the Poskein Lake arrived at a truly proper moment.’

Thanks to him, they were able to perfectly block the Kapeo Troop’s front and back.

‘Since the legion’s number of soldiers has increased with Semi joining……’

Now, the time to shake the board had come again.

Many plans were raised within his head.

At that moment.

“My lord!”

A familiar voice was heard.

When he turned his head, Chris, who was coming out of the forest, was seen.

His expression was really bright to a degree of even making the mood of people who saw good.

It was certain that he brought a good news.

Sure enough.

“It’s a good news, my lord.”

Even his voice was cheerful.

Roan quietly waited his next words.

Chris brightly smiled and added on.

“The transfer of the County’s fief and title was approved.”

“It certainly is a good news.”

Roan cheerily smiled and nodded his head.

‘So godfather Lancephil has persuaded his majesty the king.’

For Simon, he would obviously support him, and since he had separately took care of Kallum, he thought that he would approve the transfer of the fief and the title.

“I will separately and precisely tell you the story of the transfer process, my lord. But more than that……”

Chris hesitated the end of his words, then searched Roan’s mood.

Roan faintly smiled as if to say it was okay, and nodded his head.

“Go ahead if there is something you want to ask.”

At those words, Chris calmed his breath for a moment, then asked in a small voice.

“Then I will ask just one thing, sir. Is there a reason to particularly using Prince Kallum’s letters like this? Wouldn’t it be better to reveal the letters instead and disgrace Prince Kallum like President Clay’s opinion? If not that, wouldn’t it have been better to separately store the letters and use them as means to pressure Prince Kallum whenever needed?”

Several questions simultaneously poured down.

To that much, Chris found it difficult to understand Roan’s action this time.

Roan quietly stared at such Chris.

‘It should be hard to understand.’

Not only Chris.

Austin, Semi, Harrison, Brian, Clay, and such retainers as well as the Kallum, who was the other directly related, wouldn’t be able to understand Roan’s action.

Not using Kallum’s letters, which were no different than cards of sure-win, to lead Simon to Great Duke of Grain and the next generation’s king.

Furthermore, willingly handing the letters to Kallum instead.

Everything must be questionable.

Roan breathed in deeply.

‘Right. At least, I should tell Chris.’

Now, the time to do so had come.

“Chris.”

His voice was quiet.

But it was a voice more serious and thicker than any other time.

“Yes. My lord.”

Chris felt that the mood wasn’t normal.

He straightened his pose and leaned his ears.

“In the last trip of the Pershion Kingdom, I felt many things. No, to be exact, these are things I have felt even before that.”

A resolute light floated up on Roan’s face.

“Activities of the monsters, war with neighboring kingdoms, nobles’ rebellion…… Rinse Kingdom was in a precarious state all the time. Furthermore, most of the citizens in the Istel Kingdom were starving to death from the continued fall in crop harvest, and an older brother tried to kill his younger brother because of power in the Pershion Kingdom.”

It was a series of hectic events.

He stared straight into Chris’ eyes.

“Right now, this world……”

Slightly, strength went into his voice.

“Is not a good place to live.”

Roan’s words continued to follow on.

“Chris. I have looked carefully around the Rinse Kingdom, the Istel Kingdom, and the Pershion Kingdom, and resolved.”

“Wha, what did you resolve……?”

Chris’ voice too unconsciously trembled sharply.

Roan breathed in deeply.

“To make a world that is good to live in.”

It was a firm resolution.

Boom.

Chris felt as if something heavy had filled his chest.

Roan exhaled a long sigh.

‘In truth, I first thought that I could become a monarch because I knew the future.’

But as he encountered numerous things and events, that thought became slightly different.

‘Not because I could become a monarch because I knew the future, but I must definitely become a monarch and change the future.’

If Roan was a monarch of a nation, he could had stop needless wars, save up food in preparation for severe fall in crop, and stop the situation where an older brother and the younger brother must point their swords at each other.

Most of all.

‘The Great Warring Era that will happen from now on. To end that era sooner by even a little bit, not anyone else but I must become a monarch.’

From the wars and battles that endlessly followed on, countless people would lose their lives.

The method to save them was just one.

‘Get rid of wars.’

To get rid of wars.

‘Unite the continent.’

It was an almost impossible task.

But it wasn’t a work without a precedent.

‘If it’s me, I could do it.’

It can’t be other people.

He could know because he had watched in the last life.

The current empire’s emperor and the kingdoms’ kings weren’t individuals who could unite the continent.

It was a task possible for only Roan, who knew the future.

Simon, Tommy, Kallum.

He had cleanly erased even the thought to support one of the three and raise him to the throne.

His heart and his sense of purpose, which had been somewhat soft, had solidified.

‘For me to become a monarch……’

He could only use the Rinse Kingdom as the base to grow.

But if Simon was to show an overwhelming look like now in the throne succession competition, the crack that Roan had to pierce through would disappear.

It was a situation where Tommy and Kallum must give more effort.

Because of that, Roan had willingly put down the letters that could had thrown Kallum into hell.

He had shaken the board called throne succession competition that had been going well.

‘In truth, I originally had no thought of desiring to inherit the Lancephil County and the title.’

Although the emotional part had greatly affected it, there was also the realistic part.

‘Since if I were to do it, the Lancephil County existing would have been more advantageous.’

Currently, the Tale Barony was in a form of being right inside the Lancephil County’s Southern region.

If Roan was to raise a flag of a kingdom on his own, the Lancephil County, which was amiable to him, could had acted the role of a castle wall.

But during that while, he had grasped Kali Owells’ dark scheme and had reached a point of scheming things like the Poskein Subjugation to destroy that ugly scheme and protect the Lancephil County.

‘But then, it have suddenly became a state of inheriting even the Lancephil County and the title.’

It was a slightly estranged situation from the original plan.

But Roan took this on as an another different opportunity.

‘I have sent a letter to Prince Kallum to approve the transfer of the fief and the title, and……’

He had separately sent another little bird towards the west.

Since the fief war had already arose, he planned to greatly expand that board.

When his thought had reached about that point.

“Make a world that is good to live in…… it truly is a good story. But……’

With an expression that had calmly sank, Chris added on.

“Would that be possible? It’s rather uncomfortable to tell you this sir, but that much work isn’t something a mere noble can do.”

It was true.

It was almost close to impossible for a mere noble, and Roan who had just now became a count at that, to do the work that many emperors and kings couldn’t do.

Roan formed a faint smile.

Now, the time to reveal his purpose had come.

It was a gigantic aspiration that he took out outside of his mouth for the first time.

“Chris.”

“Yes. My lord.”

Chris swallowed a dry spit with a needlessly tense expression.

It was because Roan’s air had changed.

Roan stared at such Chris, and spoke in a small but powerful voice.

“I plan to become a monarch.”

Enter the War (4) End.

Chapter 167




T/n: The missed last Sunday’s chapter. Assuming I can finish before Kuhaku goes to sleep, the sponsored chapter will be up in the next few hours.

A northern wind blew.

At the bleak battlefield where the cleanup of the aftermath was being done.

At that place, Roan and Chris were standing and staring at each other.

I plan to become a monarch.

The weight Roan’s words had was incredible.

No, it was truly shocking.

This was a betrayal and treason much more serious than Elton Coat’s rebellion.

But Roan who had took out the words as well as Chris who had heard the words were greatly composed and calm.

A silence had fallen between the two people, but it was absolutely not an awkward and suffocating silence.

A moment later.

The tips of Chris’ mouth slightly went up.

“It might be hard to believe, but I somehow felt that it was like that.”

His voice was soft.

His expression was greatly calm.

Instead, the side that was surprised was Roan.

“It felt that it was like that?”

At the words that asked back, Chris nodded his head.

“Yes. It felt that it was like that. No, to be exact, I think I wanted it to be like that.”

The end of his voice slightly trembled.

“You wished for me to become a monarch?”

Roan asked in a small voice.

Chris faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Yes. My lord has some unknown and strange feeling. There’s something that’s hard to describe with words. This person is different, there is something different than other people. That feeling.”

“You wished for me to become a monarch because of a reason like that?”

Roan asked once again.

Chris shook his head.

“No. It isn’t only because of such reason. At first, I also wished to support my lord and raise one of the three princes to the throne of the next king. Whether that was Prince Simon, Prince Tommy, or Prince Kallum, it didn’t matter who it was if it was an individual with the character of a king. I simply planned to follow my lord’s wishes. But……”

A bitter smile hung on his mouth.

“When I actually found out the circumstances in the palace, Prince Tommy wasn’t quite a good person. He was greedy and sly, and was a man who was busy filling his own greed.”

Roan slowly nodded his head.

In actuality as well, Tommy in the last life was captivated by an ugly greed as the throne succession competition intensified and had done all sorts of depravity.

He had received the condemnation of the citizens as well as the noble houses by himself.

Chris’ words continued.

“Prince Kallum is also the same. Instead of the kingdom and the citizens, he himself is the first. On top of that, he is a person whose heart is so hard to know, and most of all, he personally tried to kill my lord. The worst of all is that the undulations of his emotions are too extreme. Of course, even though he is a much better person than Prince Tommy when looking at various abilities.”

This too was true.

Kallum in the last life, after winning in the throne succession competition, climbed onto the king’s throne.

He was a so-so king who wasn’t excellent but neither bad, but he at least had the eyes and the magnanimity to know how to use various people.

The problem was that his emotional undulation was greatly severe.

It was different than Simon’s sanguine personality.

To put it simply, his heart was on the side of being almost as small as a single grain.

There were incidents where he cancelled the work he approved in the morning around lunchtime because of a reason that his mood wasn’t good, and there were incidents where he exiled the chief commander of the guards because of a reason that it felt like he ignored him.

Of course, his mood became better after a day had passed and he did reinstated the chief commander again.

Pierce and Ian, who were the two axles of the Rinse Kingdom, had juggled and coax such Kallum and had led the kingdom’s administration well.

It was because there was almost no case of him rebelling against them as long as they first and continued to humor and made his mood good.

But because of Kallum’s such personality, sycophants swarmed.

In truth, such problem was happening even now.

Roan didn’t knew yet, but Kallum who discovered the key to the locker of erasure not being able to control his emotions and exploding, and people like Count Jonathan Chase, who pretended to be Tommy’s close adjutant publicly, and Elton Coat, who raised a rebellion, swarming his surroundings were in fact because of Kallum’s such personality.

“At least Prince Simon, if we exclude his sanguine personality, is the most outstanding in terms of abilities. He actively backs my lord too. And his retainers too, because there were many excellent people, the possibility of him becoming an excellent king if only aided well looked high. Furthermore, my lord was also known as Prince Simon’s support faction. I wished for my lord to become Prince Simon’s close adjutant and enjoy glory. But……”

At the time when the last fall and winter were passing.

Chris’ thought was completely changed.

“Experiencing the Poskein Monster Subjugation, that thought was completely changed.”

Poskein Monster Subjugation.

Also known as Poskein Exodus.

Roan instantly understood what Chris was talking about.

‘Since I too have became drifted apart with Prince Simon because of that very event.’

The event that caused a change in their relationship.

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

“At the time when the exodus had reached its end, I told Prince Simon that we shouldn’t let down his guard because the monsters’ appearances would increase by five times than normal.”

He was talking about the final exodus.

Chris took on the remaining words.

“At the same time, we requested that we send messengers to Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum too so that they would prepare. Prince Simon had gladly said that he would do so, but……”

“He deceived me by pretending to send the messengers and then in fact excluded the relevant information.”

Roan creased his brows.

The painful feelings from then floated up anew.

Due to this horrendous choice by Simon, who wished to step ahead in the throne succession competition, the Poskein Lake’s west and the southwest regions were reduced to rubbles.

Although Tommy and Kallum barely retained their lives and had returned with few of the knights, the citizens of the lake’s vicinity were killed in masse as the subjugation force helplessly collapsed.

It was all an event that had happened because of Simon’s choice.

Roan as well as Chris too.

‘The change in my feelings began at that time.’

‘It was from that time. That I wished for not the three princes, but my lord to become a monarch.’

If the others who did not knew of the such circumstances of their hearts, Roan’s actions were definitely a rebellion and a treason.

But despite so, Roan had to make his decision.

‘I cannot pretend to not know despite knowing that the world will become a mess.’

He tightly clenched his fist.

Ambition soared.

Roan looked straight into Chris’ eyes.

“Chris. I have revealed my intent to you first. Whatever decision you make, I will respect that. If you were to perhaps leave my side, then I will quietly send……’

When his words reached about that point.

Chris brightly smiled and shook his head.

“Leave? Did I not say that I didn’t wished to do that, my lord? I……”

He stared straight into Roan’s eyes.

The light in his eyes were hot.

“Will always stay at my lord’s side.”

Silence.

Silence fell once again.

Similarly, it wasn’t an awkward or suffocating silence.

It was a time of deep meaning that they confirmed each other’s feelings.

Roan slightly lowered his head.

“I will depend on you from now on.”

“I will also depend on you, my lord.”

Chris, with a smile on, lowered his head.

Suddenly, Austin’s voice was heard from afar.

“My lord! The preparations have been completed!”

The preparations for the battles that would follow had been completed.

Roan slowly nodded his head, then stared at the battlefield.

Chris looked at Austin and carefully asked.

“We are winning one after another and are in the middle of marching towards the east, but……”

His voice was somewhat worried.

Roan understood his heart.

“Are you worried of our western back?”

Chris slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. Currently, we are receiving Agens, Tenebra Troop, and druids’ help to grasping the enemy’s location, direction of movement, and such, then are doing raids and ambush tactics. As we did that, it became a situation where we left big and small enemy troops at our western back, and……”

“Since the Chase County is there in the west, there is also the problem that they could reinforce their number of soldiers at any time.”

“That is correct. There is a danger that our backs would receive a sudden assault at any moment.”

Chris made a worried expression.

On the other hand, Roan was greatly relaxed.

“It seems that you have momentarily forgot because it’s so hectic, but……”

He looked towards the west and made an odd smile.

“I have the best sword in the kingdom.”

“Ah……”

Chris popped out a quiet gasp.

As Roan’s words had said, he had momentarily forgot.

That before starting the Poskein Lake Subjugation, there was a troop that separately headed towards the west.

Roan looked at Chris and slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. In the west……”

The smile that hung on his mouth became much thicker.

“The kingdom’s best sword, Brian Miles has began to move.”

*****

“This is something ridiculous!”

A voice filled with rage hit the ears.

At the giant tent that five commanders were gathered.

Amongst them, the youngest man bursted out in rage with a brightly flushed face.

The other people did not shouted in a loud voice, but were also completely enraged in various ways.

“He is right. I didn’t know that Prince Kallum would act like this.”

“This is a betrayal. A betrayal.”

Voices mixed with annoyances tangled together.

Their gazes naturally headed towards the head of the table.

The middle aged man dressed in a splendid armor.

He was Count Jonathan Chase, who had raised the current fief war together with Kali Owells.

Jonathan looked at the letter placed on top of the table and clenched his teeth.

The letter was something that had flew to them from the capital, Miller.

Inside it, the contents that said that Io Lancephil’s fief and title would be transferred to Roan was written.

And, the content that Kallum had approved that transfer was also written in.

“It seems I have looked at Roan Tale too easily.”

Jonathan chortled and shook his head.

The commanders, who had been noisily chatting just what did that mean, widely opened their eyes.

Jonathan, with a short sigh, added on.

“Do you think Prince Kallum have approved the fief and the title’s transfer without any reason? Roan Tale, that kid must have done some work. Kukuku. A bastard who knows how to swing a kingdom’s prince as he wishes…… how fun.”

With a monstrous laughter, he closed his eyes.

“A, are you okay, sir?”

The commanders searched Jonathan’s mood.

Originally, his personality was that of being greatly aggravated when things didn’t go the way he wished.

But at least this time, his mood somehow looked not as bad as they thought he would be.

“If the board is twisted and shaken, I merely need to set it again. Furthermore……”

Jonathan opened the eyes he had closed and formed a horrifying smile.

“Roan Tale too was a bastard I had to take care of some day.”

Instead, he planned to throw the bastard down into hell through this chance.

“Send someone to the mercenary guild in the Mediasis Castle. The time for those kids to slowly move have come.”

Exactly for a moment like this, he had planted a spy faction inside the Tale Barony for quite a long time.

The time to storm from both the outside and the inside had come.

Although it was a different development than his thoughts, a development more satisfying than he had thought was drawn.

“Send a man to the county. We will need an augmentative force.”

At those words, many commanders formed a bloody smile.

“Do you plan to hit the back of Roan Tale’s head, sir?”

Jonathan quietly nodded his head instead of an answer.

He gently closed his eyes again.

‘Roan Tale.’

Within his head, the sight of that fool-like bastard floated up.

‘A lowly background bastard plans to climb to the kingdom’s counthood? Hmph!’

It was ridiculous.

‘I can’t simply stay still and watch such an act.’

A horrifying smile hung on his mouth.

‘Lancephil County and even the Tale Barony…… kukuku. It seems the fief will increase more than twice.’

Strength went into his shoulders.

If the things were resolved as he planned, he would obtain a power comparable to the kingdom’s four dukes.

‘The era of Chase House will open in full swing.’

Suddenly, a powerful pressure poured out from his entire body.

It was excitement that couldn’t be controlled.

Jonathan was already drawing the brilliant future after the victory.

That was a truly impetuous and foolish action.

*****

Tellan region located in the Lancephil fief’s midwest.

As a region where a hill and a plain were connected, it was an even topography where there was no place suitable to particularly ambush or hide oneself.

As the Tale Legion’s raid and ambush attacks continued with the western region as the center, the Count Chase Forces had began to set camps in plain topographies where all directions were wide open.

The Tellan region here was also one of such places.

The camp of the Hadding Legion, which acted the role of the command center that commanded numerous troops at Count Chase Forces’ back, had set up its place right here.

“I heard that the west is a mess right now?”

“Right, and it’s not an ordinary mess either. They say that four rear troops have been destroyed at Tale Legion’s hands.”

“It seems that our side hasn’t even caught Tale Legion’s tail.”

At the camp’s entrance, the sentries who received the guard mission chatted.

They were fully absorbed in the story of Roan and the Tale Legion.

“But wasn’t there an order to not enter the fief war unless you’re directly involved?”

“That’s what they said. Even though a big trouble will happen if he went against the capital’s order, even if Baron Tale is a rising hero.”

They still did not knew that Roan had inherited Io’s fief and title.

“Anyhow, he is a great man in lot of way.”

“Right. Really, for an ordinary commoner like us to become the kingdom’s nob……”

When one sentry’s words reached about that point.

“Eh?!”

“Look over there!”

Another sentry pointed towards the west and shouted.

It was a dust cloud that thickly rose up.

Dududududu!

Soon, the sound of horse hooves were heard.

“Enemy?! Or an ally?!

One of the sentires asked with a completely nervous expression.

Amongst them, the one who was a captain class shouted out aloud.

“For now, ring the bells first!”

As soon as his words fell, the watchtower’s bell noisily rang.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

The peace of the camp was broken.

The soldiers raced out from numerous tents.

The commanders too hurriedly ran towards the camp’s fences.

“What is it!”

Troop commander Serum, who undertook the camp’s defense, glared his eyes.

The sentries, instead of an answer, pointed towards the west.

Dududududu!

The sound of horse hooves became much noisier.

It was a single troop made up of cavalry.

They, in no time, reached a place close to the camp.

“Ah!”

Suddenly, Serum bursted out a low exclamation.

“It’s the Kapeo Legion! It’s the Kapeo Legion’s flag!”

As the troop neared, the flag that rose at the head was clearly seen.

The armors of the cavalry were also definitely those of the Count Chase Forces.

“An urgent message! An urgent message!”

One of the horseman shouted aloud at the top of his lungs.

“Kapeo Legion annihilated! We received Tale Legion’s raid attack and were annihilated!”

It was absolutely not a report they wished to hear.

Serum stood at the watchtower and looked at the Kapeo Legion’s remnant soldiers.

Their looks were all completely lost like one.

‘Damn it! Has even Kapeo Legion been done in?’

Serum tightly clenched his teeth once, then raised his right hand.

“Open the camp’s gate! We will treat the injured.”

“Troop commander. They may be enemy’s spy.”

One soldier opined in a small voice.

Serum son snorted.

“Even if it’s so, it’s a small-scale troop that’s not even a thousand men. Our number of soldiers is a legion that’s over several thousands. There’s nothing that’ll be a problem.”

His voice was full of confidence.

“Hhm. Even so……”

The soldier who opined hesitated.

Serum then soon scowled his eyes.

“Shut it! Cowers can step back! Hurry and open the gate!”

“Yes! Understood, sir!”

Other soldiers answered in a loud voice and then quickly moved.

Soon, the camp’s entrance that had been tightly closed opened.

To treat their injuries, the Kapeo Legion’s remnant soldiers headed towards the empty lot at the outskirt of the camp.

“Who is the commander?”

Serum quickly went down from the watchtower.

From the remnant soldiers, the man who shouted first stepped forwards with two horseman.

Beyond the helmet that was deeply pushed down and worn, eyes overflowing with a tired look were seen.

“I’m Tas of Kapeo Legion’s Maien Troop.”

“Adjutant Henry, sir.”

“Adjutant Peil, sir.”

Serum creased his brows.

“Maien Troop adjutant? You guys are the commanders? What about Legion Commander sir Donald Kapeo? What happened to other troop commanders or the legion adjutants?”

Tas quickly answered.

“Legion Commander Sir Kapeo has lost his life at Baron Tale’s spear. The other troop commanders and the legion adjutants too have died during the battle. Just us have luckily survived and were able to run.”

“Hhm.”

At the horrible report, Serum leaked a groan.

“Could you report of the battle situation and the progress?”

“Of course, sir.”

Tas quickly nodded his head.

“Good. Then the three people follow me.”

Serum moved his steps towards the inside of the camp.

Of course, he had them separately gather and place aside the weapons they carried before that.

Tas, Henry, and Peil looked at each other once, then quickly followed his back.

“It seems even Kapeo Legion was done in.”

“This really is a big trouble.”

“Wouldn’t Tale Legion appear soon?”

“Nah. They can only do raids and ambush strategies because their number of soldiers are small. They never attack a camp set up in a place like this.”

“Well, that is true.”

The soldiers who poured out of the tents looked at the remnant soldiers and whispered.

Meanwhile, Serum and the remnant soldiers reached the legion commander’s tent at the center of the camp.

“What is it?”

Legion Commander Viscount Beiro Hadding, who was already out of the tent, creased his forehead.

Serum quickly went up and lowered his head.

“It’s the Kapeo Legion’s remnant soldiers. They say that the legion was annihilated at Tale Legion’s raid attack.”

“What!”

Beiro glared his eyes and shouted.

If it was the Kapeo Legion, it were a quite large sized legion even though it was temporarily made.

The scale itself was different than the four troops that were destroyed in advance by the Tale Legion.

“Explain thoroughly.”

Beiro went up to one of the remnant soldiers and asked in a severe voice.

Amongst the remnant soldiers, Tas opened his mouth as a representative.

“Yes. I will explain thoroughly, sir.”

He calmed his breath once, then meticulously told the battle situation that had happened between the Tale legion and the Kapeo Legion.

“Us Kapeo Legion had set up a camp at a covert place inside the western hills. It was a place that no one could ever find even if it was the such ghostlike Tale Legion. But while one of the troop inspecting the nearby region was returning to the camp, its tail had been caught by the Tale Legion. Without knowing such fact, we……”

An odd story continued on.

That was certainly not the story of the Tale Legion and the Kapeo Legion’s battle.

But there was no way that the Hadding Legion’s commanders, including Beiro, would know such truth.

After an unknown amount of time, about the time Tas’ story began to show its end.

“Hm?”

Beiro unknowingly creased his brows.

The guy who was standing next to Tas, Henry, had entered his sight.

To be exact, at the guy’s waist, the object that was hanging there had made him creased his forehead.

“That’s……”

His voice leaked out in daze.

Many commanders, including Serum, followed Beiro’s gaze and turned their heads.

All of their gazes headed towards Henry.

The black stick hanging on his waist pierced through their sight.

“Eh? That’s……”

“Perhaps?”

“No way.”

It was a very familiar object.

It was an object so famous to a point of making them want to ask just why they hadn’t discovered it until now.

Beiro creased his forehead.

“Perhap Travias Spear?”

It was Roan’s beloved weapon.

How was that hanging on a remnant soldier’s waist?

At that moment, Henry slowly removed the helmet he had been wearing.

“You guys realized that slower than we thought.”

His voice was serene and calm.

When he took off the helmet, a manly face appeared.

Several commanders, including Serum, didn’t recognized it, but Beiro, who was the kingdom’s noble, instantly realized his identity.

“You, you are!!!”

His voice was greatly taken back.

Henry, who took off the helmet, faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

“Yes. I am the very……”

His right hand grabbed the black stick at his waist.

“Roan Tale.”

Enter the War (5) End.

Chapter 168




T/n: Tuesday Chapter.

Update: Sorry, but ch. 169 (Saturday’s chapter) will be a bit late. Got some work I need to do.

“You, you crazy bastard!”

Viscount Beiro Hadding shouted at the top of his throat.

It was a completely unexpected event.

“For you to enter the enemy camp on your own!”

Disguising as a remnant soldier and infiltrating the enemy camp.

He admitted that it was a bizarre scheme that was difficult to predict.

But just what use was that?

The number of soldiers Roan dragged and brought with him were merely a thousand.

Compared to that, several thousands of soldiers were stationed inside Hadding Legion’s camp.

“Kukuku. So you went mad trying to kill yourself!”

Beiro smiled terrifyingly and brought his hand to his waist.

The commanders, knights, and numerous warriors around them too pulled out their own weapons.

A cold pressure raged like a storm.

However, Roan’s expression was greatly calm and relaxed.

“I have merely……”

The Travias Spear pointed at Beiro.

“Came to cut you bastard’s neck.”

Leave the body and the tail and cut off the head. 1

That was the method Roan had chose.

Chang!

The Travias Spear elongated longly and the sharp spearhead showed itself.

Beiro snorted.

“It seems you can’t see your surrounding situation.”

More than tens of distinguished warriors had surrounded Roan, Tas, and Peil.

Beiro roared with a haughty expression and voice.

“You will cut my neck? Hmph! Look after your head instead!”

The instant the words fell, the Hadding Legion’s warriors closed in the encirclement.

Roan cheerily smiled and looked back at Tas and Peil.

They, who acted the role of remnant soldiers together, were Amaranth Troop’s soldiers and the two were both the 1st generation Taemusas.

The two people stared at Roan and slightly nodded their heads.

It meant that the preparation was done.

Roan glared at Beiro again.

“Look after my head instead? How funny. To cut my neck……”

The smile that hung on his mouth became much thicker.

“You will need at least twice as many more warriors than now.”

The words ended at that.

With his left leg as an axle, Roan turned his body and swung his spear.

Paat!

The body of the spear moved as if to dance.

Kakang!

Metallic sound noisily rang out.

The Travias Spear powerfully hit the swords of two warriors who were near.

“Kuk!”

“Damn it! Just how strong……”

The two warriors clutched their hands and stepped back.

The swords they had held were dropped onto the ground.

As if they had been waiting, Tas and Peil kicked the ground.

The two people snatched the swords and moved as if to dance.

Chang! Chachang! Chang!

Swords clashed and sparks flew.

The Hadding Legion’s warriors, who had been vaguely maintaining the encirclement, went out in a counterattack with a shocked and surprised expressions.

“Damn it! Attack!”

“Kill them!”

A battle of tens of people against three people.

It definitely was an disadvantageous situation.

“Roan Tale. You’ve conceited too much. Did you think you could face this many knights and warriors……”

The moment Beiro’s words reached about that point.

Ssweaaaaak!

A sharp sound of impact hit the ears.

“Eh?”

“Un?”

The Hadding Legion’s warriors, including Beiro, turned their gazes following the sound.

From the outskirt of the camp, tens of arrows were flying towards them.

They were the arrows the remnant group that came into the camp with Roan shot up.

That side too had moved as they planned beforehand.

“Dodge!”

“Raise the shields!”

“Fire arrows!”

“They’re fire arrows!”

The warriors loudly shouted and crowded near Beiro’s side.

However, the arrows actually flew towards not where they were, but towards an unexpected place.

Pubuk! Pubububuk!

A rain of arrows poured down onto the tents that surrounded the center of the camp.

“Kuhahaha! Your skill with the arrows are unsightly!”

Beiro, who hid behind a shield, snorted.

However, Roan cheerily smiled and shook his head instead.

“Not at all. It was a shockingly excellent skill. Because they fell exactly where I wanted.”

The very instant his words ended, flames burst up from where the arrows fell.

However, the flames merely burned the surrounding tents and swayed, and actually did not pose any big danger.

Beiro, with a smile full of triumph, gloated again.

“Kukuk. Were you planning on using fire field tactic or something? They fell where you wanted? Even though it will be difficult to see a big effect with merely this much?”

At those words, Roan faintly smiled and raised his left hand.

As if they had been waiting, Tas and Peil, who were at the sides, stepped back with short salutes.

Roan, while slantly holding the Travias Spear, used the Flamdor Mana Technique.

The heat of his mana hole began to boil like lava.

“Beiro Hadding.”

His voice was low but powerful.

A smile hung on his mouth.

“From the start, I didn’t have the thought of using something like a fire field tactic.”

Tat!

Roan’s body shot out towards the front.

It was a swift movement that truly brought a light to mind.

Beiro looked at Roan, who was running towards him, and snorted.

“Hmph! Block him! I will grant a promotion and a reward to the one who cut the bastard’s neck!”

The instant the words ended, the Hadding Legion’s warriors pounced towards Roan.

“Your neck is mine!”

“I will cut you!”

“Die!”

Moths.

They were idiotic and foolish moths who lost their sight at greed and ambition.

Roan’s spear cut the space.

The spear handle repeated to extend and contract as it wished.

The width was also the same.

Ssskuk! Sssguk!

Each time, the warriors’ chests or throats were pierced.

Boom!

Occasionally, they were even blown away everywhere with a sound of explosion.

“Damn it! Everyone attack!”

“Push with the number!”

However, the Hadding Legion’s warriors too did not fall back easily.

Their eyes were still lost at greed and ambition.

Tens of them pounced towards Roan.

Beiro, who had stepped back far away, looked at that sight and burst out a crazed laughter.

“Kuhahaha! Serves you right!”

The mocking look was clear.

In a glance, it looked like a life threatening situation.

However, Roan didn’t lose his composure.

He, with a composed expression, was looking at the flames that had completely swallowed the surrounding tents.

‘It’s warm.’

Thanks to Brent’s Ring, he couldn’t feel any heat beyond that.

But the mana inside his body shook as if it would explode immediately.

Roan, with the Flamdor Mana Technique, slightly released the heat he was forcefully calming.

He stared at the tens of warriors who were pouncing at him and formed a cold smile.

Paat!

Suddenly, an explosive pressure spew out from his entire body.

No, that was not a pressure, but an incredible heat.

A gust of heat, strong enough for the flames that swallowed the surrounding tents and were swaying to instantly be pushed outwards, stormed.

But that too was for a moment.

The flames that were pushed away instead increased their size and stretched towards Roan.

“Uak!”

“Run!”

“Fi, fire!”

At the incredible heat felt through the back of their heads, the Hadding Legion’s warriors ran away towards every direction.

It literally was a heat that seemed like their flesh would be cooked.

Inside the incredible storm of fire, only one man was left.

Roan.

Slantly holding the black Travias Spear, he glared at Beiro and the Hadding Legion’s warriors.

The violently surging flames, as if to protect Roan, burned spherically around him.

“Beiro Hadding. I will show you why……”

Tat!

Roan moved.

Together with him, the flames moved.

From within the incredible storm of fire, Roan’s calm voice was heard.

“I am called the Crimson Ghost.”

*****

“Report to him that we will do as the letter’s contents.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

The messenger of a bold body deeply lowered his head, then went out of the tent.

As if they had been waiting for the man to get out, rage burst out from here and there.

“I knew it would become like this. He handed over the county to Roan Tale!”

“Goodness. To think he would pass down the fief as well as even the title.”

“The more shocking thing is Prince Kallum. Just with what kind of thinking did he approved the fief and the title’s transfer?”

The ones echoing each other and raising their voices were the nobles and the retainers who followed Kali Owells.

The messenger who went out of the tent just before was a man Count Jonathan Chase had sent.

He meticulously passed the news that was at the capital, Miller, then separately delivered the letter that Jonathan’s order was written in.

“Damn it. With situation becoming like this, we definitely must make the Lancephil Fief ours.”

“No, as Sir Count Chase’s letter’s content, let us even seize the Tale Barony.”

“Yes! That should be good, sir!”

Perhaps because of the excitement, their voices slowly became louder.

At that moment.

“Quiet.”

A quiet voice filled the inside of the tent.

“Cough.”

Instantly, the people closed their mouths and turned their heads towards the head of the table.

The man frowning while holding the letter Jonathan sent in one hand.

He was Kali Owells.

‘So it ultimately became like this.’

He made a bitter smile.

Even though he had received and heard the news that Io Lancephil had transferred the fief and the title to Roan, he didn’t feel angry.

Rather, he felt a small joy at his premonition being correct.

Kali looked at the nobles and the retainers and made a faint smile.

“As per Count Chase’s request, send a part of the Fief Regiment to the west.”

He purposely chose the word request instead of order.

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Amongst his retainers, the commanders answered in a loud voice.

It was a transfer for intercepting the Tale Legion.

At that moment, magic corp head Tairon Bess spoke with a slightly displeased expression.

“Sir Count Chase’s order, no, the request seems too one sided, sir. We aren’t Sir Count Chase’s retainers yet.”

Few nobles and retainers nodded their heads.

Kali faintly smiled as he answered.

“Let us simply leave it for now.”

In any case, they had to clash again with Jonathan once this fief war finished.

‘He probably thinks he is sitting above my head.’

It was a hilarious and hasty judgment.

Behind Kali’s back, Duke Bradley Webster was there.

‘Wait just a bit. Because I will now soon climb up on top of you bastard’s head.’

The ambition he had was much greater than Jonathan thought.

“Then, do your best in the missions you have each received.”

It was the sound that signalled the end of the meeting.

Suddenly.

“Um, sir……’

One amongst the commanders spoke up with a careful expression.

“What would you do with Sir Walter?”

Walter Owells.

He was Kali’s firstborn as well as the fiancé of Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander Aaron Tate’s daughter, Mary Tate.

An alumnus of the Pavor Academy Knight School, he was a man who was also acquainted with Roan.

Kali slightly creased his forehead.

“That kid, is he still being stubborn?”

“That is correct, sir.”

The commander who spoke up awkwardly smiled and nodded his head.

On Kali’s face, which was relaxed from the start, an annoyance smeared out.

“Stupid kid. Just for whom is this all for……”

He clicked his tongue and shook his head for a while.

“Bring him here even if by tying him up.”

If he brought him and revealed his great purpose, Walter’s thought too would change.

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

The commander who spoke up first stepped back with his head lowered.

Kali looked at that sight and shook his hand.

Soon, all the nobles and the retainers exited out of the tent.

Kali, who was left alone, closed his eyes and exhaled a long sigh.

“Foolish child. He’s only behaving spoilt without even knowing this father’s great meaning.”

He thought of Walter’s defiance as a degree of an immature action.

Kali was an outstanding knight and a talented warrior, but actually concerning his child, he was a truly ignorant father.

Even if he did not know, he didn’t knew his son, Walter, too much.

*****

“I, it’s a monster.”

The Hadding Legion’s soldiers who saw the giant flame and crowded.

While circling the center of the camp long around, they couldn’t move any further.

All of them, with a half dazed expressions, swallowed dry spit.

At the place the soldiers’ gazes touched.

At that place, crimson flame was swaying in a spherical shape.

“I, it’s a crimson ghost.”

“It’s the Crimson Ghost.”

Whispering sounds rang out from here and there.

Crimson flame.

Inside that, a man stood.

The man who slantly held the black Travias Spear and poured out a bold pressure.

He was Roan.

In his surroundings, tens of corpses that were burnt coal-black were strawn.

They were the Hadding Legion’s warriors who were captured by greed and ambition and had attacked Roan.

Amongst them, there was only one person who was left unscathed and alive.

Beiro Hadding.

“Uuuuh. Ri, ridiculous.”

He quiveringly trembled his entire body and shook his head.

His expression was that of saying that he simply couldn’t believe what had happened in front of his eyes just before.

‘Is this the Crimson Ghost I only heard through words?’

There was a time when he had heard the rumor that Roan had done great accomplishment at the war with the Istel Kingdom.

Especially the great accomplishment at the final chase had begot even a nickname called the Crimson Ghost.

‘I didn’t believe it because the rumor was too absurd, but……’

The rumor said that he controlled the flames as if his arms and legs while his hair and entire body turned red.

‘Although the hair and the body didn’t turned red, him controlling the flames like his arms and legs were true.’

Beiro swallowed a dry spit.

If he could, he wanted to run into the gaps between the soldiers, but his legs didn’t listen.

Completely pressed down by Roan’s pressure, the two legs solidified stiffly.

His eyes quickly turned.

‘Fo, for now, I have to live.’

Beiro soon made an awkward smile.

As if to show that he had no desire to fight, he extended his two hands.

“B, Baron Tale. I, it looks like I’ve done something wro……”

When his words reached about that point.

Roan’s right hand slowly moved.

The Travias Spear that was pointing at the ground lazily cut the space.

Paat!

The flame that spherically swayed violently moved following the spear.

“Huhuk!”

Looking at the flame that flew towards him, Beiro quickly tried to move his body out of the way.

However, the legs that had stiffly solidified did not move as he desired.

Spat!

The tip of the spear and the flame simultaneously brushed Beiro’s neck.

“Ggrrk.”

With a sound of blood boiling, Beiro goggled his eyes.

Without even being able to exhale out his last breath, he fell flat forwards.

Boom!

With a blunt sound, the head that was barely attached rolled on the ground.

Roan looked at that sight and murmured in a quiet voice.

“I told you. I came to cut you bastard’s neck.”

Soon, the surroundings became noisy.

“Uhuk!”

“Si, Sir Legion Commander!”

“Sir Viscount Hadding!”

Few soldiers lost their fears and pulled out their swords.

Roan quietly breathed in deeply, then pulled the Flamdor Mana Technique to the limit.

Suddenly.

Paaaaaat!

With him at the center, an incredible gust of heat stormed.

At the same time, the flame that were burning spherically burst out as if exploding.

“Uuak!”

“Run!”

The Hadding Legion’s soldiers, who were closing in an encirclement of their own, screamed and lied down on the ground.

The gust of heat and the flame soon disappeared.

Ssss.

A warm western wind blew into the desolate camp.

The one who was standing on two legs was only Roan.

The Hadding Legion’s soldiers were all flatly lied down on the ground.

Although it was to dodge the flame, from a glance, it looked as if they were prostrating on the ground towards Roan.

Roan boldly stood and stared at the soldiers.

There were no such thing as a frightening killing intent or a threatening pressure.

However, the soldiers couldn’t dare think of standing up.

An overwhelming power.

A dignity pouring out from the soft gaze and the calm expression.

To Roan, they had their bodies and hearts all succumbed into submission.

‘It’s done as I thought.”

Roan inwardly formed a smile.

The strategy of disguising as Kapeo Legion’s remnant soldiers and infiltrating into Hadding Legion’s camp.

‘It was a strategy Ian had made and Pierce executed.’

Austin, Harrison, Chris, as well as even Beiro, who was the enemy commander.

Likely, they all thought that this strategy was a bizarre scheme.

However, this strategy was a standard strategy most closest to the standards amongst the standard strategies.

Not a petty trick or a tactic, but the power itself was the strategy.

‘Conquer the enemy using overwhelming strength.”

It was the most foundational and primeval combat tactic.

In truth, Roan had continued his victory through schemes like raids and ambushes based upon information until now.

Although there were occasionally cases where he cut the enemy commander’s neck through a duel, there weren’t many cases where he showed off the strength he had to his heart’s content.

Because of that, there was a question asking if Roan’s strength, the Crimson Ghost’s rumors were exaggerated.

Roan had used such strategy in order to dispel that very such question and raise his presence.

‘To me, I don’t only have strategies, tactics, and powerful soldiers.’

Before that, the truth that Roan himself was an owner of an incredible power would be known once again.

Tale Legion.

Amaranth Troop.

In front of those names that shook and rang the Rinse Kingdom, Roan Tale would be brought up in people’s mouths first.

Not as a nickname like the noble of a commoner background or the rising hero, but as a general more powerful and fearful than anyone, as the Crimson Ghost.

Roan quietly closed his eyes.

The scent of the battlefield spread to the tip of his nose.

When he was fully enjoying the lingering ambience.

[Uah. Please don’t pretend to be all cool. I feel like I’m dying from the cringe!]

A sharp voice was heard.

It was Kinis.

[What am I supposed to do if you explode the heat like that when I’m right next to you?]

It was a pointless grumbling.

Roan opened the eyes he had closed and awkwardly smiled.

Kinis was seen in front of his eyes.

“Un?”

Roan made a slightly surprised expression.

“You……”

[Why?]

Kinis raised her hands onto her waist and creased her brows.

Roan slightly tilted his head and spoke with a puzzled look on his face.

“Your appearance changed?”

for those who don’t get this part, it’s a metaphor of the legion to a snake. The soldiers are the body and the tail, and the commander (Beiro) is the head. ↩

Chapter 169




T/n: Tuesday Chapter. The last Saturday’s chapter will also be up soon, and hopefully together with the sponsored. Sorry about the messed up schedule. I’ve been a bit busy making preparations to go back to school.

[Hiiaa!]

Kinis looked over her body, then soon screamed out a sharp shriek.

[Red! Red! I turned red!]

It was literal.

Her skin, which originally was slightly tinted with a red light unlike other water spirits, turned noticeably red.

Furthermore, her blue hair too glittered with a soft purple light.

Kinis, who was fussing about, suddenly glared at Roan.

[This is all your fault! I turned into a monster because you recklessly spout out heat!]

It was a pointless grumbling.

Roan awkwardly smiled as he shooked his head.

‘What do you mean a monster? You turned much prettier than before. It’s also somewhat mysterious.’

Perhaps because of the unexpected praise, Kinis soon closed her mouth.

She looked over her body this way and that and continued to tilt her head.

[Hmm. Really?]

Her expression was slightly nervous.

Roan brightly smiled and nodded his head.

‘Yeah. You’re pretty.’

At those words, Kinis chewed her small lips, then soon let out a short sigh.

[Sigh. Can’t be helped. Anyway……]

She extended her hand straight towards an empty ground.

She planned to check whether a change had also appeared in her abilities as much as her appearance had changed.

Roan too watched that sight with deep interest.

The water energy on the mana hole’s surface smoothly went out.

Suddenly, a blue spout of water soared up from the empty ground Kinis was pointing at.

Thankfully, the shape and the color were the same as before.

At least, its outward appearance was.

[Huu.]

Kinis relaxed and exhaled a long sigh.

‘It’s good.’

Roan also looked relaxed.

But in truth, Kinis felt that somewhere inside her body had strangely changed.

[[Since it’s a really little change, there probably isn’t any need to particularly say it.]]

Because Kinis herself wasn’t sure, she thought to keep it a secret for now.

She didn’t want to needlessly worry Roan.

Most of all.

[[If I say it now, it’s obvious that he would definitely blame himself.]] 1

Already, she was worrying of Roan more than herself.

Meanwhile, the Hadding Legion’s soldiers, even while Roan and Kinis were talking inside their minds, had lied on the ground and did not carelessly moved.

During that time, the Amaranth Troop’s soldiers, who had disguised as remnant soldiers, quickly took over the Hadding Legion.

Simultaneously, the Tale Legion’s main forces, which had been hiding in ambush nearby, also quickly charged and captured the Hadding Legion’s camp.

With this, Roan had dominated the Tellan Region, one of the major positions of the Lancephil Fief’s western region, and the Hadding Legion, which had acted the role of the command center, with an overwhelming strength as the background. 2

It was a great accomplishment.

However, the truly great accomplishment was another.

That was the fame of Roan, the Crimson Ghost had began to spread with the Lancephil Fief’s midwest as the starting point.

Now, the spirit of the Count Chase Forces and the Owells Forces’ soldiers, even by merely hearing the news of Roan’s appearance, snapped a level.

This was the point that Roan desired.

Already, he was gradually bringing about the fief war’s victory.

*****

“Just what turn of events is this?”

Baron Sabb Carpenter, a retainer of the Count Chase House as well as the one who took on the position of Carpenter Troop’s troop commander, had received Count Chase’s sudden letter and was in the middle of heading towards the east.

“Lacenphil fief and the title have went over to Roan Tale? Tch!”

Sabb shook his head as he greatly scowled his face.

“It seems that even Io Lancephil went senile. To think he would pass down the fief and the title to a brat without a single drop of blood mixed.”

He slightly turned his head and looked at the troop’s soldiers.

Their number reached no less than five thousand.

‘Pressure the Tale Legion from the back, is it.’

Jonathan’s order was simple.

Conscript a part of the defensive troop that was left in the Chase County and the fief’s citizens, organize them under the Carpenter Troop’s command, and then to attack the Tale Legion’s back.

“Kukuku. Tale Legion bastards. We will drive you mindless from the front and the back!”

Since Owells Forces had also said that they would separately send out a troop, shattering the Tale Legion wasn’t even a work.

At least, he thought like that.

‘I can’t be slower than the Owells Forces.’

Sabb kicked his horse’s stomach and raised the marching speed.

At that moment.

“Un?”

At the opposite field, a single group appeared.

Their number was about two thousand at most.

“Halt!”

Sabb gradually slowed his horse’s speed and glared at the front.

Flags were raised straight.

Tale Legion.

Vende Troop.

Two more flags were also raised besides them, but that wasn’t very important.

“Tale Legion?”

Sabb creased his forehead.

‘How come at a place like this?’

Currently, Sabb’s location was a part of the Chase Fief and the Lancephil Fief’s border.

According to Jonathan’s letter and the information he had separately gathered, Tale Legion’s current location was Lancephil Fief’s midwest region.

Furthermore.

‘Vende Troop?’

Even the troop name was greatly unfamiliar.

‘Anyway, it isn’t the Amaranth Troop.’

The Tale Legion’s most famous troop as well as the most powerful troop.

The tips of Sabb’s mouth lightly went up.

‘It seems it’s a troop that took on rear defense mission. It’s a number just right for a warm up.’

At that moment.

Vvuuuuu!

A sound of horn noisily echoed.

Simultaneously, the part of the Tale Legion’s troop began to charge towards them.

“Ugh! An abrupt attack! P, prepare for battle!”

Sabb, with a surprised and shocked expression, quickly raised his right hand.

“Prepare for battle! The enemy is in front!”

Soon, numerous adjutants scattered in every direction.

“Prepare for battle!”

“An enemy has appeared in the front! Prepare for battle!”

Their movements were somewhat flustered.

However, Sabb soon squinted his eyes.

The speed of Tale Legion’s charge was too slow.

“A heavy armor troop?”

His face twisted bizarrely.

That was an expression of a confusion mixed with jeer.

“Hahaha! That side’s troop commander is a brat who doesn’t even know the T of tactics! To think he would use the heavy armor troop as the vanguard to charge!”

Sabb loudly laughed and placed the cavalry squad at the vanguard.

“We’ll shatter you in an instant!”

He raised his spear up high and personally led the troop.

“Attack! Attack!”

Sabb spurred his horse and charged towards the Tale Legion.

“Waaaah!”

“Attack!”

The cavalry followed behind.

Their faces were all confident like one.

Not only were they greatly ahead in head count, they had the confidence to easily trample the heavy armor troop, whose movements were sluggish.

‘Even if they were a heavy armor troop, they won’t be able to block the cavalry’s piercing charge!’

A collision of warhorses and humans.

The fight’s victor and loser were no different than having being already decided.

That was what Sabb and the Carpenter Troop soldiers’ thought.

But in actuality, the thought of the Tale Legion, and especially the troop commander who led the Tale Legion’s Vende Troop, was completely different.

The young man who was leading the troop while wearing a heavy armor.

He was in fact Brian Miles, the Vende Troop’s troop commander and the one who Roan called the kingdom’s greatest sword.

‘My lord truly is great.’

Even while leading the heavy armor troop Vende and charging, Brian couldn’t stop his awe.

The point when he had separately led the Vende Troop and two thousand-man troops and moved towards the west was when the Poskein Lake Subjugation had just began.

‘It was an order to secure a position and then be ready since it wasn’t possible to know what kind of thing Kali Owells would do.’

In fact, the fief war had suddenly broke out not long after the Poskein Lake Subjugation had started.

If possible, Brian too wished to quickly join the war and help Count Io Lancephil, but he could only hold his position due to the capital’s order.

Like that, there was no meaning to him coming all the way here and securing the position.

At that moment, Roan’s letter arrived.

‘To think our lord has become a count! And inherit even the Lancephil Fief too!”

It was the happiest of the happy occasions.

Simultaneously, he had gained the pretext to join the fief war.

Roan assigned an important mission to Brian.

‘My mission is……’

Brian stared at the Carpenter Troop’s cavalry squad that had already neared and smiled.

‘Stopping the merging of the enemy reinforcements.’

Stopping or destroying the enemy reinforcements heading east from the Lancephil Fief’s western rear region or the Chase County was exactly Brian’s mission.

Although it was a very difficult and dangerous mission to execute with a troop strength that merely reach two thousand, Brian was confident.

Understandably.

‘Vende Troop is a troop I personally raised.’

He had separately drafted the ones who were talented even amongst the Taemusas and had created the heavy armor troop.

The very thing that was born at the end of personally training them was the Vende Troop.

Furthermore.

‘We even equipped a secret weapon.’

The tips of his mouth lightly went up.

Clank. Clank.

Dududududu!

The sound of heavy armors clanging and the sound of horse hooves.

The two sounds slowly became noisier and the distance between the Vende Troop and the Carpenter Troop rapidly shrank.

Suddenly, Brian, who had stood at the head and was charging, raised his sword up high.

“Equip the plate helmets!”

As soon as his words ended, the Vende Troop’s soldiers brushed down the frontal part of their helmets with their left hands.

Cluck!

Suddenly, a dark plate appeared at the part where their two eyes were revealed.

A tool the alchemy department and the engineering department had collaborated and created, it was an object that was coated with the magic stone powder on a metal plate, made with iron as the base and mixed with numerous minerals, after piercing tens of small holes.

Although it was an appearance that seemed like nothing could be seen from a glance, the sight become only a little cramp and there was no large problem.

Feeling the view that become a little tight, Brian loudly shouted once again.

“Armor light activate!”

This time, repetitions followed.

“Armor light activate!”

Resounding voices echoed.

And at the same time.

Paaaaaat!

With Brian at the head, an incredibly bright light exploded out from the armors of the Vende Troop’s soldiers.

“Kuuk! Wha, what!”

“Uak! What is this!”

“My eyes! My eyes!”

The Carpenter Troop’s cavalry, which had been enthusiastically charging, tightly closed their eyes at the group of incredible light that exploded right in front of their eyes.

However, the problem weren’t them.

Hihihihing!

At the sudden attack of light, the horses were greatly shocked and thrashed.

Because of the speed at which they were charging quickly, they soon lost their balance.

Kukung! Boom! Kukukung!

The horses repeated to hit each other and tilt, then soon fell flat towards the ground.

On the other hand, Brian and the Vende Troop’s soldiers, thanks to the plate helmets, were able to see and move like before even inside the bright lights.

‘Armor light. It’s much more brilliant than I thought.’

The armor light were objects that the Reno Magic Tower and the engineering department had created by collaborating.

An object created with the magic lamp as the basis, it could be said to be a relative of the Boat Light that had shown up before in the Poskein Lake.

‘The enemy cavalry had completely collapsed.’

Compared to that, the Vende Troop hadn’t received any damage.

It was a chance.

“Attack!”

Brian’s order fell.

“Waaaah!”

The Vende Troop’s soldiers raised their swords and rushed.

Spat!

As fitting a troop made completely of Taemusas, mana flowed following their swords.

Ssskuk! Sssguk!

With horrifying sounds, the Carpenter Troop’s soldiers, who had been rolling on the ground, lost their lives.

“Uaaak!”

“Sa, save me!”

“I can’t see!”

The confidents looks weren’t seen.

Their appearances were of servile looks begging for their lives.

Amongst them, even the troop commander Carpenter was there.

“Sa, save me! Please! Please save me!”

However, that was a vain cry.

Brian lightly swung his sword and cut off his head.

“Don’t leave even a single bastard alive!”

If they keep their hearts soft and a part of them went east, the Tale Legion’s main force could receive a big damage.

“Yes sir!”

With a sound of resounding answers, the Vende Troop’s soldiers busily moved.

From afar, it looked like a group of light busily moving around.

This was the first appearance of Brian Miles, who would later be called the knight of light, and the Vende Troop that would later be called the troop of light.

*****

“Damn it! Where are the reinforcements? Are the reinforcements still not here!”

Pillam Troop’s troop commander, Hector, burst out in rage.

His close-aid and the head adjutant Baison answered in a hurried voice.

“The nearby region’s troops have already been annihilated, sir!”

“Even I know that! The reinforcement I’m talking about are the bastards who were supposed to newly reinforce us from the county!”

Hector’s face flushed red.

Baison, with a perplexed expression, dropped his head.

“I, I don’t know, sir. Based on the time, they should already have more than arrived, but……”

“Damn it! Without even a reinforcement, how do we……”

Hector stared at the crimson wave that spread beyond the wooden fences and creased his forehead.

No, that was close to a pure tearful frown.

“Face that Tale Legion by ourselves!!!”

The moment his words reached about that point, a hurried shout was heard from the direction of the camp’s fences.

“The, the soldiers are fleeing!”

“Soldiers are running away, sir!”

At those words, Hector ran towards them with a shocked expression.

“What do you mean! Soldiers are running away?”

“Lo, look over there, sir.”

The soldier who had shouted pointed at the outside of the fences.

Tens of soldiers were raising their two hands up straight and were running towards the Tale Legion.

“Th, these cowards!”

The mood rapidly died down.

One of the soldiers murmured with a small voice.

“Since Tale Legion accepts all those who surrender, sir. But for the ones who resist……”

Another soldier finished the sentence.

“They cut all the necks without leaving a single one.”

His voice was completely dispirited.

At those words, Hector pulled out his sword with an expression frosted with rage.

“Cowardly bastards! We are the Count Chase Forces! Are you saying that you’ll lower your heads towards a classless bastard like that just because you’re afraid of dying! You mongrels who don’t even know honor!”

The rage blew like a storm.

The soldiers all dropped their heads.

At that moment.

“I’m sorry, but life is more important than a mere thing like honor, sir.”

A voice abruptly popped out from behind Hector.

“Un? What are you……?”

Hector creased his forehead and looked behind him.

And at the same time as him.

Ssskuk.

With a horrifying sound, a single blade of a sword pierced his chest.

“Kkureuk. You, you……”

Hector glared his eyes and scowled.

“I’m sorry. But my soldiers and I don’t want to die a dog’s death.”

The one who stabbed Hector’s chest was Baison.

He quickly cut Hector’s neck, then shouted in a loud voice.

“I, Baison, has cut Hector’s neck! Pillam Troop surrenders immediately to the Tale Legion.”

Despite the abrupt situation, there was no soldier who rebuked or resisted.

Their spirits had already been crushed by the Crimson Ghost Roan and the Crimson Legion Tale Legion’s fame.

Instead, an odd feeling of relief set on the soldiers’ faces.

‘We lived!”

They were clearly such looks.

Soon, a white flag was hung high and the camp’s gate widely opened.

Like that, Roan and the Tale Legion achieved a victory without a single proper battle.

Clop. Clop.

Roan, who had worn a helmet deeply, entered into the camp on a warhorse.

Baison and the soldiers all lied on the ground and couldn’t even dare raise their heads.

Without any particular words, Roan headed towards the commander’s tent at the center of the camp.

Instead, Austin, who was following behind, spoke in a loud voice.

“You have made a wise decision! We will reorganize the troops starting now!”

Once the order fell down, the low rank commanders, including the ten-man commanders, rapidly moved their feet.

The thousand-man commanders momentarily watched that sight, then headed to the center tent Roan was in.

When they opened the tent’s door and went in, Roan, who was sitting at the head seat, was seen.

Austin cheerfully smiled and raised his thumb.

“Good for you. Since you only have to sit still and watch.”

They were simply difficult to understand actions and words.

At that moment, Roan, who was sitting quietly, took off the helmet he had worn deep.

“Puuhah!”

The breath he was holding bursted out aloud.

“Don’t say such thing, sir. I really feel like dying.”

The voice half mixed with whine.

The face that appeared once the helmet was taken off.

Shockingly, the man who was wearing Roan’s helmet and armor was Harrison.

Austin smiled as he looked at that sight.

“It can’t be helped since your body shape is the closest to the lord. Anyway……”

His gaze headed towards the northeast.

“Would the lord arrived well?”

At those words, Harrison put the helmet on again and answered.

“He should have arrived well, sir.”

His voice was full of certainty.

Soon, Austin too nodded his head.

“Right. He should have arrived well.”

The two people’s gazes met.

Simultaneously, the same words flowed out.

“Since he went together with Pichio.”

*****

A blue sky.

The road that stretched long on one side of the plain was truly peaceful.

“A peacefulness like this has really been a while, sir.”

“You’re right. This place feels like a completely different world.”

Two young men were talking quietly and walking on the road.

One young man looked truly manly, and the other young man’s face was amiable with greatly large eyes.

“Anyway, our luck was really good, sir. To think we were able to dodge the Owells Forces and the Count Chase Forces while coming all the way here……”

The young man whose eyes were large exhaled a sigh of relief.

The manly looking young man shook his head.

“It wasn’t simply our luck that was good. Pichio, it’s your ability that is excellent.”

The young man whose eyes were large was Pichio.

Pichio bashfully smiled and scratched the back of his head.

“I merely moved following my feelings, but…… I’m glad that it was of help to my lord, sir.”

Lord.

The manly looking young man was in fact Roan.

After leaving his role to Harrison, he was secretly moving separately.

Pichio looked at the end of the road.

“Now, there isn’t much distance left until we reach the Guardian Army’s territory. If we go a little bit more, then…… un?”

He, who was continuing his words, soon creased his brows.

Roan stared at him and asked in a low voice.

“What is it?”

At those words, Pichio formed a bitter smile.

“Somehow, the feeling isn’t good, sir.”

From a perspective, they weren’t any special words.

But the problem was that the man who spoke up those words was Pichio, whose sixth sense was irrationally outstanding.

Roan too made a bitter smile.

“Pichio. I feel unreasonably worried since you said those words.”

“Nah. Would something possibly happen, sir? My feelings can’t all be……”

The moment Pichio’s words reached about that point.

Vvuuuuu!

A sound of horn hit the ears.

At the same time, the ground subtly shook, and then a single group appeared from the end of the road.

“Uak! My mouth is too light, sir!”

Pichio tearfully frowned and dropped his head.

Roan did not mind and stared at the end of the road.

A flag soared at the head.

Roan looked at the flag through the Kalian’s Tears.

The letters written on the flag was seen.

Lancephil Guardian Army.

Unlike their worries, the troop that appeared at the end of the road was not the Owells Forces or the Count Chase Forces, but the Lancephil Guardian Army.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

‘So there are times when Pichio’s sixth sense is……’

When his thought had reached about that point.

Vvuuuuu!

The sound of horn was heard once again.

Crimson Ghost (2) End.

when Kinis talks, single bracket is her talking through thought with Roan, and double bracket is her private monologue. ↩

for those who don’t get the imagery here, tl;dr is that Roan dominated the Tellan Region and the Hadding Legion with an overwhelming strength, with emphasis on strength than strategy/tactics. ↩

Chapter 170




T/n: The late last Saturday’s chapter.

Why was there no instant when the sad predictions were wrong?

No, in truth, Pichio’s case was slightly different.

Because regardless of whether it was good or bad, the feelings he felt were correct with a very high probability.

Dududududu!

A sound of horse hooves noisily rang.

Behind Lancephil Guardian Army, a single group showed itself.

Chase Legion. 1

Rain Troop.

It was the Rain Troop, whose fame was high even amongst the Chase Legion’s troops.

The troop commander Viscount Rust Rain, together with Viscount Royce Fielder who undertook the role of this fief war’s supreme commander, was one of Count’s Chase’s right-hand retainers.

He, unlike Royce who had both strength and resourcefulness, used a giant hammer as his favored weapon as a fierce general who charged without regards to front nor back.

“It looks like they’re being chased, right?”

At Roan’s question, Pichio nodded his head.

“Yes. In anyone’s eyes.”

The two people formed bitter smiles.

Roan deeply pulled down his hood and used the Flamdor Mana Technique.

“It seems that we should prepare for battle.

It was an urgent situation.

They couldn’t step back pretending not to see.

No, in the first place, there was neither a leisure nor space to do so.

‘We have to hide our identity.’

For now, they had to at least hide the fact that Roan had appeared here at the Lancephil Fief’s northeast region.

Because of that, he couldn’t use the Travias Spear he had hidden inside his chest pocket.

It was a disadvantageous situation.

However, composure overflowed in Roan’s expression.

‘After the battle with Sethus, the quality of the mana has rose greatly.’

Two types of mana.

Heat and water energy.

After learning the fact that he could use the heat and the water energy as much as he wished, Roan intentionally used the heat during battles or duels until the bottom showed.

This was something possible because there was the water energy he could separately and also use.

And when the heat filled the mana hole after the battles ended, much purer and greater amount of heat was filled.

Thanks to that, the mana hole at his lower abdomen slowly became much larger, and not only that, as he used large amounts of mana at once, his mana road had also became much wider and stronger.

He had became able to use more quickly and easily a much greater amount of mana than before.

‘As the amount of mana increased, it became possible to use the techniques of Reid Art of Fighting that I had only been learning within my head.’

It meant that even if he couldn’t use the Travias Spear, he had separate skills he could use to face the enemy forces.

And it was the fighting technique of Reid, who wasn’t excluded whenever people debated of who the strongest human was, to boot.

Since there wasn’t any instant when Roan showed off Reid’s Art of Fighting on the battlefields, it shouldn’t be easy for the Rain Troop to discover Roan’s identity.

He tightly clenched his fists and stared at the Lancephil Guardian Army and the Rain Troop that had reached their nearby surroundings.

Pichio too, with a slightly nervous expression, pulled out his sword.

“There’s people at the front!”

“Move aside! Move!”

The Lancephil Guardian Army, which had been mindlessly running away, discovered Roan and Pichio a moment late.

They pulled their reins and narrowly brushed past the two people.

Roan and Pichio quietly stood their ground and awaited the Rain Troop that would rush towards them.

Gulp.

Pichio gulped dry spit with a completely tense expression.

Roan faintly smiled and asked.

“Are you scared?”

At those words, Pichio shook his head.

“That isn’t so, sir. Since my lord is next to me. Should I say that it’s making me slightly tense? Also……”

He glared straight at the front and added on.

“The apprehensive feeling has disappeared, sir. Somehow, I feel a good feeling.”

A smile hung on Pichio’s mouth.

Roan too cheerily smiled as he nodded his head.

“Is that so? Those are welcoming words.”

There was no instant where Pichio’s feelings were wrong.

For some reason, a feeling like having won was felt even before the battle had started.

Finally, the Lancephil Guardian Army all passed by, and the Rain Troop that followed right behind showed up.

It was a sight of charging with an outrage speed while exuding an inauspicious pressure.

“Should we play a round?”

Roan, while tightly clenching his fist, kicked the ground.

Tat!

The image of his body extended long towards the Rain Troop.

It was a swift and quick sight.

His two fists became tinted red.

Through the Flamdor Mana Technique, powerful heat bursted out.

“What the! What’s that crazy bastard!”

“Trample him instantly and continue the chase!”

The Rain Troop’s soldiers looked at Roan, who was running towards them alone, and snorted.

Vigor of trampling with the solid hooves.

At that moment.

Tat!

Roan lightly kicked off the ground as he watched the cavalry rushing towards him.

At the same time, he twisted his shoulder back, then powerfully trusted his right fist using that recoil.

From the crimson-tinted fist, mana burst out.

Boom!

With a sound of explosion, the horseman who was running ahead first was blown off.

Kwakakang!

The horsemen at the lead tangled against each other and fell.

“Wha, what!”

“KuuuK!”

The cavalry that had been charging with a powerful thrust faltered and slowed their speed.

‘It’s done.’

It was the situation Roan wished for.

However outstanding a strength he had, he couldn’t face a troop number numbering over a thousand men alone.

Roan’s plan was to stop the Rain Troop’s feet for at least a moment for now.

He once again prepared a powerful strike.

At that moment.

“You brat!”

With a thunderous roar, a giant warhorse jumped out from the center of the troop.

A warrior of a large build was sitting on the warhorse, and he held a giant iron hammer in his right hand.

He was the very troop commander of the Rain Troop and one of Count Jonathan Chase’s right-hand men, Viscount Rust Rain.

Ssuung!

A great hammer much larger than an adult man’s head cut apart the air.

Roan lightly moved his feet and twisted his body.

Boom!

The hammer directly hit an empty ground.

Tududuk.

With an explosive sound, rocks and earth soared.

“Oh ho. You dodged that? What’s you brat’s identity?”

Rust, with an amused light in his eyes, glared at Roan.

But because of him having deeply worn the hood, there was no means for him to recognize his face.

Roan, instead of an answer, kicked the ground again.

The two fists weirdly moved and created tens of afterimages.

“A fist master, is it? Hmph!”

Rust quickly swung his hammer as he snorted.

Each time, the dizzily drawn images disappeared in ones and twos.

‘He really is a fierce warrior.’

Roan inwardly exclaimed and thrusted his fist as he twisted his body.

The entire fist flashed with a red light.

“You dare!”

Looking at the fist aiming at his abdomen, Rust pulled his hammer.

Suddenly.

Ssuung!

Roan’s fist changed its trajectory towards a simply impossible direction.

An incredible sound of impact hit the ears.

“Eh!?”

Rust stared at Roan’s fist with a shocked expression.

No, he could only stare at it.

It was already too late for his body to react.

Roan’s fist that aimed at his abdomen, drawing a ridiculous arc, headed towards the horse’s neck.

Crack!

A horrifying sounding impact echoed out.

Roan’s fist pierced into the warhorse’s neck.

Without even making a cry, the horse lost its life.

The four legs that had been standing strong swayed limply and the giant body crumpled to the side.

“Kuk!”

Rust quickly turned his body and soared up into the air.

Boom!

With a dull sound, the horse fell.

Following right behind, Rust stepped down next to that.

“You dare!”

He raged at the death of the beloved horse he roamed the battlefields together for tens of years.

Rust clenched the hammer with both hands, then rushed towards Roan.

As he, who originally attacked brutishly even without that, lost his mind from rage, his might became much stronger than before.

‘It almost feels like I’m looking at a berserker.’

Roan dodged the hammer this way and that and clenched his teeth.

If he were to be even brushed slightly, his bones would break.

“We will continue the chase!”

“Continue the chase!”

The Rain Troop’s soldiers, who watched momentarily, pulled their reins and prepared to chase.

“I, I’ll try to stop them, sir!”

Pichio bravely stepped up.

But stopping more than hundreds of soldiers by himself, and a cavalry at that, was something impossible.

Roan tightly clenched his teeth.

‘I can’t just let them go. Should I use the blink?’

But he soon shook his head.

It wasn’t the right time yet.

Roan nimbly dodged Rust’s hammer, then jumped into his chest.

Rust’s size seen from near was much bigger than he had thought.

“You brat!”

Rust closed his arms as if to catch Roan.

Roan, imagining up a body technique of Reid’s Art of Fighting in his mind, slightly bent his knee.

It was a very stable pose.

And just like that, he grabbed Rust’s waist with one hand and quickly and erratically moved his two feet.

Spat!

Suddenly, Roan’s body softly moved like a snake, rode Rust’s abdomen and side, and passed over to his back.

A smooth movement.

“Eh? Eh!”

Rust’s expression was greatly taken aback at having instantly shown his back.

Roan, just like that, hugged his waist with two hands and pulled up mana with all his strength.

Suddenly, the giant body rose up into the air.

“Hahaph!”

With a grunt, Roan threw Rust towards the cavalry.

“Eh! Eheheheh!”

“Ca, catch!”

“Catch!”

The soldiers who were about to go on the chase, looking at Rust flying towards them, widely opened their two arms.

Boom!

With a dull sound, tens of horsemen rolled on the ground together with Rust.

Roan watched that sight for a moment, then quickly kicked off the ground.

It was to help Pichio, who was fighting alone.

Pubuck! Pububuck!

The fists and the feet left numerous afterimages and cut apart the space.

Each time, warhorses, horsemen, swordsmen, and archers fell powerlessly .

“Pichio. Slowly move back.”

“Yes sir.”

Pichio answered shortly and quickly moved back.

His looks had already became a mess.

Although his instinct was unrealistically outstanding, it was a fact that his strength was still lacking.

At least thanks to having learned the Tale Mana Technique, it was at a level where facing ordinary soldiers wasn’t difficult.

Pubuk! Pubuk!

Roan quickly moved this way and that and drove away the Rain Troop’s soldiers.

At that moment.

“You brat!”

Rust rushed towards him again while raising his hammer.

Roan snatched a soldier that was nearby, then quickly threw him.

If he was an ordinary general, dodging or receiving him was normality.

But Rust batted away the soldier that flew towards him.

“Kuhuk!”

A scream filled with pain hit the ears.

Rust did not mind that and rushed towards Roan.

Roan, with a slightly stiffen face, roared.

“You bastard don’t have the qualification of a general!”

At those words, Rust snorted.

“A general is only judged based on his strength!”

The excellent general he imagined was a general whose strength was powerful.

Roan glared at the hammer that arced down like it would shatter his head.

‘I can use it only once.’

Blink.

The spell that could make him instantly travel a very short distance.

It was one of the spell carved in the Brent’s Ring.

‘I’ll use it now.’

Roan felt the mana inside his body and breathed in deeply.

Instantly, the heat inside his body was pulled up into the Brent’s Ring.

Following the ring, the magic array flashed.

‘Blink!’

Suddenly, Roan’s body disappeared as if washed away.

“Eh?!”

Rust widely opened his eyes and made a surprised expression.

Boom!

The hammer powerfully struck the spot Roan was originally standing on.

Simultaneous.

Paat!

Roan, who had disappeared, appeared at Rust’s back.

Rust, seemingly still not having discovered Roan, was looking around this way and that.

Roan, just like that, turned and kicked his bottom.

Puuk!

At the powerful strike, Rust’s body lightly floated up, then was slammed directly into the ground.

“Kuk!”

At the unexpected strike, Rust greatly panicked.

Lying on the ground, he stared at Roan.

No, he tried to stare at Roan.

However, the thing he saw was only a red-tinted fist.

Puuk!

Roan’s fist heavily struck Rust’s face.

“Kkug!”

The nose collapsed and the all the teeth broke.

Puuk! Puuk!

Roan did not falter and continued to throw his fist.

Blood splattered in every direction.

Rust, who tried to at least counter, soon lost his strength and drooped powerlessly.

“A general is only judged by his strength? Even so, it’s the same that you don’t have the qualification of a general.”

It was a cold roar.

Puuk!

The final strike powerfully hit Rust’s neck.

“Kguruk.”

With a sound of blood boiling, his neck snapped to the left.

He died.

Roan lightly swung the fist dripping with blood, then stared at Rain Troop’s soldiers.

Because of the deeply worn hood, the mood was much more dreary.

‘It would be good if their spirits are snapped……’

He could end the battle.

But.

“T, troop commander sir!”

“Sir Viscount!”

“Kuuk!”

The Rain Troop’s soldiers shouted with faces flushed red.

Their spirits, at the death of their commander and a noble Rust, instead boiled up.

‘It’s a brave troop resembling its commander.’

Commonly, a troop that lost its commander would have its spirit snapped and scatter.

However, there occasionally were troops whose vengefulness and desire to fight burned up even more.

Rain Troop was the latter kind.

‘It became quite a headache.’

From using the blink spell just now, he had spent quite a lot of mana.

Although water energy was still left, he couldn’t perform the Reid Art of Fighting with the water energy.

It was a situation where he couldn’t use the Travias Spear.

In the end, he could only use another weapon, but there was nothing amongst other things that fit in his hand.

“Let’s avenge Sir Viscount!”

“Let’s kill that bastard and commend troop commander’s death!”

The Rain Troop’s soldiers raised their weapons up high and shouted.

Roan slowly moved back and looked at Pichio.

“Pichio. While I block them, run away toward the back.”

At those words, Pichio shook his head.

“No. I will also stay here, sir.”

Roan creased his forehead.

“If it is because of me, there is nothing to worry. Since if it is me alone, I could easily escape.”

It was the truth.

While fighting a melee, he could easily run if needed.

However, he couldn’t do that if Pichio was here.

At those words, Pichio cheerily smiled and shook his head.

“I’m not worrying about my lord, sir. Right now, my feeling is very good.”

He stared at the Rain Troop, no, the road beyond the Rain Troop.

“It’s a feeling as if someone would appear.”

As soon as his words finished.

Vvuuuuuu!

From the front and the back, the sound of horn was heard.

The Crimson Ghost End.

Chapter 171




T/n: The final sponsored chapter in the sponsored bar…

Update: Forgot to mention this, but Sunday Chapter will be moved to Tuesday as a double release. I need to study and retake the driving test on Monday. Sorry.

The troops that appeared in the front and back.

Amongst them, the troop that appeared in the back was the very troop that had been chased and was running from the Rain Troop.

On the other side behind the Rain Troop, the troop that appeared at the end of the road was a completely new troop.

Lancephil Guardian Army.

Pavor Academy Troop.

Familiar name was written on the high-soaring flag.

Roan made a faint smile.

‘So it’s the troop made up of Pavor Academy’s graduates and students.’

Already, he was well-informed of the information concerning the Lancephil Guardian Army through Agens and Tenebra Troop.

The Lancephil Guardian Army.

This legion began from the small-scale resistance made up of the fief’s citizens of the northeastern region centered around the few nobles and influential countryside houses. 1

Here, as the anti-Owells faction and the Pavor Academy’s graduates and students who escaped from the Pavor Castle joined, it slowly took on the more systemic shape of a legion.

Especially, the joining of the Academy Knight School graduates and students had raised up their strength, which had been falling somewhat, by several degrees.

This was because most of them were knights or reserve knights who were learning the mana technique.

In other words, it meant that the Pavor Academy Troop that appeared at the Rain Troop’s back, although their number of soldiers were small, were all skilled warriors who were learning the mana technique.

“We attack together!”

“Charge!”

From the front and the back, resounding cheers exploded out.

“Damn it! Do not step back!”

“Attack! Attack!”

The Rain Troop too did not retreat and counterattacked.

Although it was a situation disadvantageous to them in anyone’s eyes, they were the kind who absolutely did not knew of retreat.

There was also the fault of troop commander Viscount Rain’s death paralyzing their reasons.

Boom!

With a sound of an explosion, the battle began.

Soon, a chaotic fight spread.

Roan and Pichio did not unnecessarily jumped in and retreated to the back.

‘We will only make them needlessly confused.’

There was no need to make a crack in the well-organized group battle.

The battle flowed as predicted.

Although they had even formed a tie at first from Rain Troop’s fierce attack, soon the tight situation of the battle began to collapse from the combined attacks from the front and the back.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

The Rain Troop’s soldiers, together with throes of death, fell in ones and twos.

Finally, only after the moment their numbers did not quite reach five hundred, the sound of a horn signaling their retreat echoed.

Vvuu! Vvuu! Vvuu!

“Retreat!”

“Retreat towards the west!”

With a loud sound, the few small number of soldiers who survived began to run.

Even during that while, they did not forget to collect Rust’s corpse.

‘It’s a good troop.’

Beyond enemies and allies, them being a powerful troop was the truth.

Lancephil Guardian Army did not obstinately chased their back.

It was because they too had received a great damage in a battle few days before.

Furthermore, the western region was Chase Legion and the Owells Forces’ territory.

If not careful, there was a concern of being ambushed or receiving an unexpected attack.

“Clean up the battlefield!”

A thunderous voice hit the ears.

Soon following that, five young man came towards Roan and Pichio.

Amongst them, two people who were standing the most ahead slightly lowered their heads.

“I’m Pavor Academy Troop’s troop commander Aios Laden.”

“I’m the 3rd Guardian Troop’s troop commander Quals.”

Aios Laden was, as a graduate of the Pavor Academy Knight School, a person of a countryside noble house within the Lancephil Fief.

On the other hand, Quals was a hunter from Lancephil Northeast’s Landingham Region, which was the Region of Guardian Army’s base.

Roan and Pichio did not carelessly spoke up.

No, there wasn’t even a space to speak up.

“From seeing only two people trying to stop the Rain Troop, I thought that you were insane men.”

Quals shook his head with a surprised expression.

“But not only did you stop the cavalry’s charge, you even beat that highly infamous Viscount Rust Rain to death! That was really amazing!”

The elated story continued on longer for a while.

He greatly inflated Roan’s actions and chattered as if to brag.

“I was so embarrassed from seeing the two sirs facing the Rain Troop. And because of that, I organized the soldiers again and have went out to counterattack.”

The reason the 3rd Guardian Troop that had been running had returned again was because of that such reason.

At that moment.

“Troop commander Quals. The story is enough with that much. More than that……”

Aios, with a thinly opened eyes, stared at Roan.

“I’m curious of the sirs’ identity. It doesn’t seem that you are enemies, seeing how you blocked the Rain Troop, but……”

Even so, they couldn’t hastily think of them as allies either.

Aios, who had momentarily hesitated the end of his words, asked in a low and quiet voice.

“What are your identities?”

At those words, Pichio cheerily smiled and answered first.

“I’m Pichio.”

“Pichio……”

Aios tilted his head.

There wasn’t any particular memory that came up.

Understandably, Pichio, even in the Tale Barony, took charge of the Mediasis Castle’s public order and had focused on inside activities than outside activities.

It wasn’t a widely known name yet.

Aios and Quals’ gazes headed towards Roan.

Roan, with two hands, grabbed the hood he had deeply worn.

“I am……”

It was a quiet but powerful voice.

Slide.

The deeply worn hood fell down to his back.

A manly looking face was clearly revealed.

Roan faintly smiled and added on.

“Baron Roan Tale, no……”

The end of his words slightly blurred.

But already, Aios and Quals were greatly shocked.

The two people stared at Roan while goggling their eyes.

It was because they hadn’t thought at all that they would meet Roan at Landingham Region.

A heavy silence fell down.

At that moment, Roan’s final words broke the silence and continued on.

“I am Count Roan Lancephil.”

*****

Landingham Region located at the Lancephil Fief’s Northeast.

It was a major border region where the borders of three kingdoms, Rinse Kingdom, Byron Kingdom, and the Istel Kingdom, touched.

Because of that, the number of the residents and the soldiers were, despite being a rather remote place, on the large side compared to other regions.

Thanks to the very such reason, when the Lancephil Fief became perilous from Count Jonathan Chase’s invasion, the resistance of that time, the current Guardian Army, could gather and rise up.

Although the Landingham Region’s base city, the Bert Castle, wasn’t a castle with a large size like the capital, Pavor Castle, its walls were high and its reserved food were plenty as befitting a major border city.

The Bert Castle that had been burning the desire to resist and counterattack even after the fief war had broke out.

Right now, that place burnt up even hotter due to a single news.

“Have you heard? They say Sir Baron Tale is coming!”

“What Baron Tale. Did they not say that he had inherited Sir Count Lancephil’s fief and title?”

“Ah! Right. The messenger that arrived a step ahead did definitely been spreading such rumor around.”

The news that made the Bert Castle jump.

It was Roan’s appearance.

And it was the news that the very Roan had inherited Io Lancephil’s fief and title.

“It should be true, right?”

“Of course. Definitely. Do you think Sir Count Roan Lancephil has possibly said a nonsense?”

“Right. Since he isn’t such a man. Anyhow, if it becomes like that……”

Suddenly, the people’s voices became low.

They pointlessly looked around at nearby eyes and added on.

“What happens to the Guardian Army?”

“You said it. Although everyone did say that they rose up to save Sir Count Io Lancephil and the fief, but……”

“In truth, they have been aiming for the next seat of count after cleaning up this event.”

“Right. Right.”

Of course, these were the thoughts of the castle’s ordinary citizens.

The voices became quieter.

“Then what happens to Sir Baron Landingham?”

“You’re right. Even though Sir Baron Bernard Landingham was the sir who led the resistance and the Guardian Army to here……”

Although everyone had been keeping quiet, there were many opinions that Bernard Landingham would continue Io Lancephil’s back in the case the fief war was sort out just like that.

At that moment.

“It’s Sir Baron Landingham!”

One of the castle’s resident shouted in a loud voice.

On the street that continued from the official mansion at the center of the castle to the west gate, the Lancephil Guardian Army’s major commanders, including Bernard, showed themselves.

‘Hhm. Everyone is being agitated.’

The middle-aged man standing most ahead amongst the group, Bernard, leaked a quiet groan.

He brushed the beard that was grown long and laboriously made a relaxed smile.

However, his inner heart was truly complicated.

‘To think Roan Tale would inherit the title of count together with the fief……’

As he was isolated at the Lancephil Fief’s Northeast, he wasn’t well-informed of the kingdom’s news.

‘What would happen to us, the Lancephil Guardian Army……’

It was a worry whether the ones who had risen up for Io Lancephil and the Lancephil County would obediently follow Roan.

“I……”

The inside of Bernard’s head became more and more complicated.

Originally, he wasn’t a man with a large ambition.

Although he was debated as the individual closest to the next seat of count, there was not a single moment when he himself had entertained such greed.

‘If Roan Tale has the qualification as a count, I plan to follow him as much as possible.’

In any case, it was Io’s judgment and Io’s decision.

Respecting that too was a duty that he had to do as the Count Lancephil House’s retainer.

When his thought had reached about that point.

“It’s Sir Baron Roan Tale!”

“No, I told you it’s Sir Count!”

“Whatever! He has come over there!”

The Bert Castle’s citizens made a fuss.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards the west gate.

Clop. Clop.

Together with a sound of horse hooves, Roan and Pichio entered inside of the castle gate.

Roan hadn’t particularly worn down the hood.

The manly looking face was clearly revealed.

“Waaaaah!”

“Hmm.”

It was an odd reaction mixed with cheers and groans.

Even the ordinary citizens each showed a different reaction to Roan inheriting the title of count.

At least the good thing was that even so, the side that supported and cheered him was much greater.

It was because of the actions and looks Roan had usually shown.

If he had acted haughty and arrogant after he had become a noble, there wouldn’t have been cheers like now.

No, in the first place, Io wouldn’t have even passed down the fief and the title to him.

The small actions that had been done for the people without being tied down by status had gathered and created the situation right now.

There was nothing that he had earned carelessly.

It wasn’t something he had earned because his luck was good.

It was all something possible because Roan’s efforts were there.

Roan went down from his horse and slowly moved his feet.

Behind him, Pichio with slightly tense-expression followed.

‘Somehow, the feeling is……’

It wasn’t quite a good feeling.

It may be because of the cheer and groans that pour down and the gazes of the complicated people.

The part that Pichio’s instinct was greatly different than a sorcerer or a fortune-teller’s power to predict.

The possibility that the instinct would be greatly shaken according to Pichio’s situation was high.

Because the ability called the instinct was itself a type of sense, it received a large effect from the conditions of Pichio’s mind and body.

In an extreme case, the instinct itself might not activate following the state of Pichio’s emotion.

If Pichio were to meet Kali Owells, who was Roan’s biggest enemy, he would naturally be swept up in a pessimistic emotion.

In such situations, not his instinct but the emotion the individual himself felt would control his body and heart.

The anger and annoyance towards Kali Owells.

This wasn’t the instinct but his own emotion.

However, from Pichio’s position, there was no means to differentiate whether that was his instinct or his own emotion.

Right now was the same.

The incredible heat more than tens of thousands citizens were pouring out.

And the whirl of extremely conflicting two emotion.

While the gazes of goodwill and hostility poured down simultaneously, the Guardian Army’s commanders, including Bernard, was exuding out an incredible spirit.

Pichio was daunted unknowing to himself and wrapped in an uneasy emotion.

And that was directly led.

‘The feeling isn’t good.’

To such a feeling.

Although it was an emotion that was felt quite ordinarily, the possibility of Pichio himself mistaking this as an instinct was plenty.

“My lord. The feeling isn’t good, sir.”

They were words passed in a small voice.

Roan quietly nodded his head.

Thankfully, he didn’t blindly trust Pichio’s instinct.

Roan calmed his breath and stopped his feet.

With a distance of a single step left, Roan and Bernard stood facing each other.

The two people couldn’t easily speak up a word.

The first sentence.

The first greeting.

With this, Roan and Bernard, the two people’s relationship would be decided and set.

Not only that, whether he recognized Roan’s transfer of the Count Lancephil title or not would also be decided.

The weight a single word had was incredibly heavy.

Roan and Bernard.

Like that, the two people wordlessly stared at each other for a long while.

‘They’re undecorated and clear eyes.’

Bernard looked into Roan’s eyes and inwardly exclaimed.

They weren’t eyes that anyone could have.

‘They aren’t eyes that oppresses and presses me down.’

The more he looked into them, he felt himself slowly falling in.

In the end, Bernard lowered his head first.

“I am a retainer of the Count Lancephil House and the one responsible for the Landingham Region’s command, Bernard Landingham, sir.”

He showed respect.

His manner and voice were polite.

“Kuk.”

“Tch.”

Few amongst the commanders behind him clenched their teeth.

Uncomfortable looks were clear on their faces.

Roan did not mind them and slightly lowered his head.

“I am Roan Lancephil.”

Through this brief greeting, Roan and Bernard’s relationship was set.

The problem was that only the two people’s relationship was set.

Sure enough.

Few amongst the commanders whose uncomfortable looks were clear burst out in rage.

“I, I cannot acknowledge this, sir!”

“Even though we placed our lives and defended the fief! For the fief lord to be suddenly changed, sir!”

“I cannot acknowledge this situation, sir!”

Most of them were young man who looked to be in the late twenties.

Roan quietly stared at them.

‘Right. They wouldn’t be able to simply step back.’

He understood the feelings of the young sons of the noble houses.

And exactly because of such problem, he had risked the danger and came to the Landingham Region here.

Of course, even though there was a more important reason.

Roan stared straight at the young nobles bursting with rage.

“I……”

It was a small but powerful voice.

“Do not require your acknowledgements.”

It was a resolute tone.

“Eh?!”

“Are you saying you’ll ignore mere things like us right now, sir?”

“Huh! I’m speechless!”

The young nobles’ voices became much louder.

Roan made a faint smile as he quietly watched that sight.

“But……”

His voice slowly became louder.

The nobles who were bursting with rage closed their mouths and stared at Roan.

The smile hanging on Roan’s mouth became slightly more thicker.

“I do need you.”

I do not need your acknowledgements, but I do need you.

Those words were heard clearly in the ears of the young nobles as well as the ears of the castle’s citizens who were gathered.

Roan looked around at everyone and spoke in a loud voice.

“No, I need everyone who is here.”

From his entire body, a soft but powerful pressure exuded out.

It was the dignity of a great general.

The people unknowingly gulped back dry spit.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards Roan.

Roan fell silent for a moment, then slowly added on.

“I will receive your acknowledgements after the fief war ends.”

His attitude and voice was overflowing with confidence.

It looked as if he hadn’t even made the thought that he wouldn’t receive the acknowledgements.

Two people amongst the nobles who burst out in rage asked.

“If we do not acknowledge Sir. Ba. Ron. Until the end, what would you do, sir?”

“Are you not worried that we won’t acknowledge the transfer of the title until the end?”

At those words, Roan cheerfully smiled and shook his head.

“I……”

The soft and powerful voice spread out to the entire Bert Castle.

“Do not worry of things that won’t happen.”

Chapter 172




T/n: Late last Saturday’s chapter. Tuesday’s chapter is currently in proofreading process, and should be up as soon as it’s done.

Note: ch.102 and ch.106’s “new medicine” , and ch. 102’s “palace”, have been corrected to “God’s Medicine” and “Holy Palace” respectively. Yes, IatM does have religion involved, albeit fictional ones.

Edit: the description of Simon’s “mana” of his “mana technique” has been correctly updated to “evil mana”.

Silence.

A heavy silence fell down.

Although there were countless people inside the conference room, not one person carelessly opened up their mouth.

Their gazes all headed towards a single place.

The young man who took seat at the head of the long table.

It was Roan.

‘The mood is strange.’

He inwardly made a bitter smile.

On the table’s right, the ones cordial to him, including Baron Bernard Landingham, had taken seat.

In reverse, on the table’s left, the ones who were antagonistic or had dissatisfaction at the current situation had taken seat.

The two sides were glaring at each other and were doing an odd psychological warfare.

The one who broke the silence was Bernard.

“For now, we must combine our strengths and repel the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces.”

At those words, a young commander who sat nearby echoed.

“That is right. There is less than twenty days until the end of the fief war. We must hurry.”

Once it became the day of the fief war’s deadline that the capital, Miller, had decided, both forces had to immediately stop the battle and draw back.

Because it acknowledged the occupied regions at the time of the conclusion as the fiefs, from the position of the Count Lancephil House which already had lost half of the fief, it was a situation where they had to go out and counterattack as soon as possible.

At that moment, from Bernard’s opposite side, the side that held antagonistic view towards Roan, a young noble spoke up with a stiff expression.

“I agree that we must repel the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces. However……”

He was Baron Andre Molde, who had walked together with Bernard since the resistance days.

Andre was the natural representative of the many young nobles as well as the commander who practically led the academy troop.

Currently, the faction that had dissatisfaction towards Roan were the Pavor Academy’s graduates, student, and noble houses’ sons.

Although their numbers weren’t very great, at least in strength, they were considered within the first finger in the Lancephil Guardian Army.

‘Although Sir Count Lancephil had transferred them and his majesty the king had approved……’

Whether to serve or not serve that Roan was a problem each individual had to judge.

Depending on the situation, the possibility of them leaving away to find a new lord was also high.

Denying the king’s approval wasn’t something that was possible, but deciding the lord to serve was an individual’s liberty.

Andre looked around at the many people of the conference room and added on.

“The Lancpehil Guardian Army has its own command system. They are all warriors who have outstanding abilities.”

To a certain degree, they were correct words.

As much as the Landingham Region was a major border region, the commanders who commanded the troops were on the side where one’s abilities were quite outstanding.

Andre stared straight at Roan.

The young general’s pressure was felt.

“Although we have heard and learned of Sir Count Roan Lancephil’s fame numerous times, we have never actually seen those skills.”

Numerous people nodded their heads.

The mood flowed on oddly.

This was a type of a pressure fight.

Officially, they couldn’t casually go against or hinder Roan, who had inherited the fief and the title.

However, fights between generals were something that could easily occur even on ordinary days.

‘It seems they wish to take the initiative.’

Roan inwardly made a smile.

Andre’s intention was clearly seen.

Sure enough.

“I wish to see Sir Count’s skills.”

Andre stood up from his seat as he slightly lowered his head.

Following his back, four young commanders echoed as they stood up from their seat.

“I also implore you, sir.”

“I too request of you, sir.”

Bernard, who had been watching, creased his forehead.

“Enough! Having a fight between allies with a big battle ahead of you! All of you must have lost your minds!”

He reproached in a loud chiding sound.

But even so, the young commanders including Andre had no thoughts of stepping back.

‘We have to dominate the initiative.’

They planned to bring the leadership of the command to them.

Although they would have to listen to Roan’s orders, speaking their voices would become much easier if they took the leadership of the command.

‘It might be difficult if we face him alone, but……’

‘If we five take turns facing him……’

‘There’s enough chance to win.’

‘Furthermore, if it’s Sir Baron Andre Molde, he may create a tie.’

Andre was a high-famed warrior in the Landingham Region.

It was to a point that rumors saying that the monsters would run just from hearing his name.

“I request of you, sir.”

Andre once again lowered his head.

“There is no need to accept, sir.”

Bernard, with a flushed red face, looked at Roan.

Roan slightly raised his right hand as if to say it was okay, then stood up from his seat.

“Alright. Checking each other’s skills ahead of the big battle isn’t bad either.”

He faintly smiled and nodded his head.

‘We did it!’

‘Alright!’

The young commanders including Andre all inwardly cheered in delight.

They looked at each other and made bright smiles.

It was a sight as if they had already won.

Roan quietly stared at that sight, then spoke in a soft voice.

“Ah, but in return, there is one request.”

At those words, the young nobles including Andre looked at Roan with puzzled expressions.

‘He wouldn’t possibly say he’ll face just one person, would he?’

‘Is he saying he will face one person per day?’

Complicated thoughts filled their heads.

Roan made a cheerful smile.

“We do not have much time left. There also isn’t the time to fight everyone individually.”

Andre and the young commanders creased their brows.

Roan did not mind them and added on.

“All of you……’

He grabbed the Travias Spear at his waist.

The smile on his mouth became much thicker.

“I will take on together.”

*****

“How do you do these days, sir?”

Simon Rinse filled cold water into an empty cup.

“There are many this and that things I am doing, your highness.”

The person holding up the teacup with both hands was Io Lancephil.

Simon nodded as he also filled cold water into his own cup.

“It seems you have became busier after your transfer of the nobility, sir.”

“It has somehow became like that, your highness.”

Io formed a faint smile.

He, like Simon’s words, was living a busier life than before after passing on his fief and the nobility to Roan.

Although it was a nobility transfer through the official procedure, the nobles who still held antagonistic positions towards Roan were many.

Io was meeting numerous nobles and making Roan’s allies.

“Roan must truly feel reassured, sir.”

Simon knew how much Io was endeavoring for Roan.

Io, instead of an answer, merely made a smile.

Clink.

Simon carefully put down the teacup he was holding, then stared straight into Io’s two eyes.

“The reason I contacted you to meet alone today is because there is something I have to earnestly tell you, sir.”

His voice and expression became quite serious.

Io too put down the teacup he held and leaned his ears.

Simon inhaled deeply.

It was a look as if he had finally made a big decision.

“I plan to place a greater strength upon Roan from now on.”

“Hmm.”

Io leaked a groan.

That Simon was already on Roan’s side was a fact that everyone already knew of.

But him particularly speaking up such words meant that there would be a bit more serious backing and support.

“I too will have to become independent soon, sir.”

Although it was a short sentence, Io, who was a veteran politician, instantly perceived the meaning within it.

‘It seems he plans to exit out of Duke Webster’s bosom.’

The meaning of why he would place great strength upon Roan became clear.

Right now, Simon.

‘Plans to make an independent faction that could stand up to Duke Webster House.’

He had chosen Roan as that faction’s leader.

Io slowly nodded his head.

Simon looked at that sight and inwardly made a smile.

‘As expected of Io Lancephil. He understood my intent completely’

Thanks to Io understanding it quickly, it became easier to open up the talk.

“However, sir, there is one problem.”

Simon’s voice became slightly lower.

Io, with a needlessly tense expression, swallowed dry spit.

Simon exhaled a short sigh.

“I need the God’s Medicine.’

The method to control the evil mana of the mana technique he was currently learning.

That was only the God’s Medicine.

Although Bradley Webster had decided to obtain it for him originally, the state of the progress was only slow.

Furthermore, he couldn’t only rely on Bradley when he had now decided to clean up their relationship.

Simon stared straight into Io’s eyes.

“Please obtain the God’s Medicine for me.”

This was the very reason Simon had called Io and had a meeting alone.

Io momentarily became silent.

‘To obtain the God’s Medicine, I have to go to the Holy Palace.’

The Holy Palace was located in the Estia Empire.

Even that itself wasn’t an easy trip, but the bigger problem was.

‘There is no way that they will hand over the God’s Medicine so easily.’

The God’s Medicine was literally the medicine of god.

Because the manufacturing method was greatly difficult, not many were available.

According to the rumors, the number of the God’s Medicine the Holy Palace kept did not exceed ten.

‘But even so, if I were to refuse……”

The story about placing strength upon Roan would become something that did not happen.

If it was Simon’s personality, it was something plentily possible.

‘Up until now, Prince Simon is closest to the seat of the next king. Prince Simon’s support would become a big strength to Roan.’

Io did not know of Roan’s dream and goal yet.

‘In the end, is there no way but to follow?’

There was no choices.

There was no method to refuse Simon’s request.

Io lowered his head.

“I will obtain and bring it, your highness.”

Instantly, a smile bloomed on Simon’s face.

“Hahaha. Truly, thank you very much.”

With a satisfied expression, he nodded his head.

The excited look was obvious.

“Please don’t worry about Roan. I will reassuringly protect him.”

Io, with a bitter smile, lowered his head.

“Yes. Thank you very much.”

If it was for Roan, he could do anything.

Although it wasn’t an easy task, even so, it wasn’t something impossible either.

‘I only need to go and come back shortly.’

He braced his heart with effort.

However, Io did not quite knew.

Of the incredible tempest this decision would bring.

*****

“Will you really not regret it, sir?”

Andre glared with his eyes while holding a wooden sword.

Around him, the four young commanders stood.

Displeased looks were clear on all of them.

“It is okay, so come at me as much as you want.”

Roan cheerily smiled and shook an end of a wooden pole.

Andre asked again.

“We are really okay to even use mana, is that right sir?”

Roan nodded his head instead of answering.

Andre clenched his teeth.

“Even if you are looking down on us, you are looking down on us too much, sir.”

Roan and the five commanders.

They were currently before a duel.

At the drill hall located behind the official mansion, many people had gathered.

‘Sir Count Lancephil.’

Bernard looked at Roan with a slightly restless look.

‘They are highly famed warriors even in this region.’

He thought that Roan had made a big mistake from an impatient feeling.

He knew that Roan’s skills were outstanding through the rumors.

But even so, facing five warriors at once was unreasonable.

‘If not careful, the commanders could look down on Sir Count.’

As Andre’s intention, the leadership of the command center could completely go over.

‘I can only cut in and stop them if pinched.’

Bernard rubbed the scabbard at his waist.

He signaled with his eyes at the commanders nearby.

They, all Bernard’s close aids, were men favorable to Roan.

At that moment.

“They, they’re starting!”

One of the spectators shouted in a loud voice.

Bernard quickly looked at Roan and Andre.

Andre had kicked the ground and was running towards Roan.

Four commanders followed his back.

The fight had finally started.

‘I have to show an overwhelming strength.’

Roan looked at Andre and the commanders and inhaled deeply.

The reason he had accepted their arrogant proposal for duel.

He too was having the same thought as Andre.

‘I will dominate the lead with an overwhelming strength.’

It was for seizing the leadership of the legion’s command.

To do so, it could not be a poor fight.

It must be an overwhelming victory.

Roan inserted strength into the hand holding the wooden pole.

Pabat!

The tip of the pole greatly shook and split the air.

“Hph!”

“Kuk!”

Andre and the commanders who were rushing towards him, surprised, swung their own weapons.

Ttadac! Ttac! Ttac!

With a heavy sound, a fierce battle spread out.

‘Kuuk. What strength……’

At the numb feeling at his wrist, Andre gritted his teeth.

The strength behind Roan’s wooden pole was enormous.

‘E, even so, we are five!’

Andre and the commanders met their eyes, then went on a coordinated attack.

Taat!

They matched their hands and feet, and instantly surrounded Roan.

A crisis.

However, Roan’s expression was greatly relaxed.

He quickly and erratically moved his feet and swung the pole.

The mana inside his body twitched and soared.

‘This is the Flamdor Mana Technique.’

The entire wooden pole turned red.

Simultaneously.

Paat!

Through the Brent’s Ring, more than ten balls of light were created around him.

It was the light spell.

“Kuk!”

“Kuuk!”

Andre and the young commanders, at the abrupt light spell, squinted their eyes.

But because they too were quite skilled warriors, they did not closed their eyes or turned their heads.

But.

Puck! Pubuck! Puck!

Taking on Roan’s pole that moved between the balls of light as if to dance wasn’t easy.

“Beautiful……”

A quiet exclamation bursted out between the spectators.

Roan’s movements were outstanding enough for an exclamation to come out.

A crimson pole roaming between the lights and embroidering the space.

“Da, damn it!”

Andre spat out a curse and swung his sword.

‘To think there would actually be this much gap.’

Rather than the rumors of Roan being pointlessly bloated, it was lacking.

‘Just one hit, I will hit at least once.’

Andre’s sword cut through the air.

At that moment, Roan’s pole that whipped the air moved erratically like a snake, then perfectly struck and hit the end of the wooden sword.

Ttaag!

An explosive sound burst out.

Simultaneously.

Puuck!

Unbelievably, the sword exploded out.

“Kuuk!”

Andre stepped back as he clenched his hand.

Roan’s pole moved without stopping.

Puuck! Pubuck! Puuck!

The young commanders’ weapons successively blew apart as if they exploded.

“Ri, ridiculous.”

The commanders shook their heads as if they couldn’t believe it.

At that moment.

A flame bursted up following the crimson-tinted pole.

The heat inside his body, in a flash, had bursted out as if exploded.

Fwooosh!

An enormous flame soared as it drew a shape of the spearhead.

Gulp.

Andre and the commanders gulped down dry spit with dazed expressions.

Roan was proudly standing while slantly holding the pole.

The crimson fire waved following the pole as if to protect Roan.

An incredible dignity that stopped breaths was felt.

That was truly an incredible sight.

“A, a crimson ghost……”

“It’s the Crimson Ghost.”

Andre and the commanders as well as even the spectators including Bernard murmured with dazed expressions.

At those words, Roan slowly shook his head.

“I am not Crimson Ghost.”

The Crimson Ghost was a story only applied to the enemies.

Roan formed a soft smile.

“I……”

Strength went into his voice.

All leaned their ears with their mouths closed.

Roan’s voice rang throughout the drill hall.

“Am your lord.”

Crimson Ghost (5) End.

Chapter 173




T/n: Slightly late Tuesday’s Chapter.

Update: Sorry, but Saturday’s chapter will be delayed to Tuesday, Sep. 5 as double chapter. My college started again this week, and it’s a bit more busy than I expected.

“How annoying.”

Duke Bradley Webster creased his brows while holding a wine cup.

In the grand and brilliant space, a duke and ten retainers including Bradley were there.

Only, unlike Bradley who was sitting on a soft chair, the ten retainers were standing straight along a wall.

“Io Lancephil……”

Bradley emptied the cup and spat out a long sigh.

‘As that man passed the fief and the title to Roan, the laboriously prepared plans became a bubble.’

No, it wasn’t at a level of becoming a bubble.

A large obstacle had appeared on the road he had schemed.

“Huh.”

A laugh came out.

It was a type of habit and a quirk that came out whenever he became angry or the annoyance soared.

He raised his head and looked at the retainers standing along the opposite wall.

“And the Prince?”

At the short questioning words, one of the retainers instantly answered.

“He is moving busily, sir.”

“Busily, is it……”

Bradley formed a bitter smile.

“This truly makes my heart sad. A grandson who doesn’t think of his grandfather as needed anymore……”

He asked once again in a quiet voice.

“They said he extended his hand to Io, yes?”

“That is correct.”

“It seems he is an ungrateful grandson……”

Bradley bitterly smiled, then filled his cup again.

“Make sure to place people in Io’s surroundings as well.”

“Yes, understood, sir.”

The retainers, with courteous manner, lowered their heads.

However, that wasn’t the end of Bradley’s orders.

“And we will have to take care of Roan’s side as well.”

“Should we attach a man on that side as well, sir?”

At the retainers’ question, Bradley shook his head.

“No. There are lot of headache-inducing bastards on that side. The possibility of needlessly borrowing trouble is high.”

“Then……”

The retainers asked Bradley’s mind.

Bradley cheerily smiled and answered shortly.

“Call the hexers.”

Instantly, surprised expressions floated up on the retainers’ faces.

‘Hexers?’

‘Is the lord thinking of borrowing those revolting bastards’ hand once again?’

Uncomfortable and dissatisfied looks.

However, Bradley did not mind them.

The hexers were merely one of the weapons he had.

“Roan, let’s tear apart……”

On his mouth, a horrifying and cold smile hung.

“That brat’s mind.”

*****

After Roan and Baron Andre Molde’s duel ended, the dissatisfaction towards Roan, whether sincerely or not, died down for now.

Their lead had been suppressed in front of the might and dignity that Roan had shown.

But.

“The number of soldiers is still inferior.”

“The level of the soldiers is also the same, sir. Since most of the Lancephil Guardian Army are farmers.”

The war situation still wasn’t good.

The situation hadn’t become dramatically advantageous just because Roan and the Lancephil Guardian Army had united.

At that moment, Baron Bernard Landingham, who had been quiet, cautiously opened his mouth.

“Even so, the frontline itself isn’t bad, sir. At the northeast frontline, us Lancephil Guardian Army, and at the center and the west, the Tale Legion have taken position.”

Taking and looking only at the frontline itself, it was a situation where they were surrounding the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces.

Baron Andre Molde cut in.

“It’s a situation where we are literally only surrounding them. Merely raids and ambush attacks are all the things we could actually do.”

Group battle or frontal fight was illogical.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards Roan.

On their faces, expectations wondering whether there might be some method if it was Roan were floated up. Sure enough, Roan formed a faint smile as if answering the people’s expectations.

“For now, I will tell you of the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces’ every little movements.”

Already, it was a situation where he had meticulously grasped the enemy forces’ size and location as well as their travel directions and the formation of their camps through Agens, Tenebra Troop, and the druids.

Through a powerful intelligence strength, he was trying to close the difference between the number of soldiers or the soldiers’ level by even a little bit.

Few commanders nodded their heads.

It was because they had vaguely realized the power information had.

However, it was inadequate to cause a great reversal.

Something a little more definite was needed.

“And……”

Thankfully, Roan had prepared another different plan.

He, with twinkling eyes, looked at the numerous commanders.

“There is a place that would harass the Chase County.”

At those words, numerous nobles including Bernard and Andre creased their brows.

“The capital, Miller, has prevented the intervention of anyone other than those directly related to the fief war, sir.”

“There is no man who could harass Count Chase.”

Even in the worst circumstance, it was something impossible for even the kingdom’s dukes.

Roan stared at their faces and smiled.

“They……”

His expression was weighty.

Soon, a surprising story flowed out.

“Are not humans.”

*****

“Huu.”

A long sigh hit the ground.

At a corner of a drill hall where not even the sunlight reached.

Underneath the shade that hung long, one young man was sitting and taking a rest.

Although countless soldiers were doing individual training and troop drills inside the drill hall, there was no one amongst them who spoke to, no, even approached him.

‘How did it became like this……’

The young man spat out a long sigh once again.

The people’s gazes felt much harsher.

At that moment.

“Hm?”

There was one man who was directly crossing the drill hall and approaching.

Each time he moved his step, the soldiers who were doing training and drills all stopped their movements and saluted.

A soft pressure exuded out from the bold steps and pose.

‘Sir Count Roan Lancephil.’

The man walking towards the young man was Roan.

The young man stared at Roan, who had reached in front of his nose in no time, and stood up from the place.

A bitter smile hung on his mouth.

‘The thing called fate truly is awful.’

He saluted towards Roan.

“I greet Sir Count.”

Roan slightly nodded his head, then stood still and stared at the young man.

The sharp looking young man.

Roan deeply breathed in and passed his greeting in a quiet voice.

“It’s been a while. Walter Owells.”

The young man, he was in fact the big shot who contested the valedictorian of the Pavor Academy Knight School and the firstborn of Kali Owells, who currently had betrayed Io Lancephil and had sided with Count Jonathan Chase, Walter Owells.

‘Is it the first after seeing at the Slan Battle.’

Roan and Walter were already acquainted.

When Roan had taken down the female Orc warrior Violin and was cleaning up the battlefield, Baron Aaron Tate’s daughter, Mary Tate, and Walter Owells had once visited the camp.

At least back then, Walter was a son of a prestigious noble house and an academy student with an outstanding ability, and Roan was an ordinary spearman of an ordinary commoner background who had nothing.

But now, Roan had became the Rinse Kingdom’s count and Walter had taken on the dishonor called the traitor’s son.

Although life was called something in which a single step ahead couldn’t be seen, the two people’s position at least had achieved a dramatic reversal.

‘I’m bold.’

Walter opened his chest with effort.

Since the moment his father, Kali, had betrayed Io and raised the fief war, he had joined the Lancephil Guardian Army.

Walter chose honor rather than blood.

He had resolved to throw his life for Io and the Lancephil fief.

To correct his father’s wrong, he had ran east and west and endeavored.

However, the people stared at Walter with not so kind gazes.

The cause of the outbreak of the current fief war and the traitor who pointed his sword at his master.

Kali’s son, Walter.

The weight that gave was much heavier than he had thought.

Due to that, Walter was heading out to the battles as an ordinary soldier without receiving adjutant or troop commander nor not even a squad commander rank despite the excellent skill.

However, Walter had no dissatisfaction at the such situation.

He understood his Guardian Army comrades and the soldiers’ feelings.

Since Walter too found his father, Kali Owells, detestable.

Roan breathed in deeply.

“Walter, what are you doing right now?”

It was a voice that seemed like it was reproaching.

Walter erased the bitter smile and dropped his head.

“I was resting for a moment, sir.”

“No, that is not what I’m asking. The current war situation is greatly disadvantageous to the Lancephil Guardian Army. But why is a man with a outstanding skill like you wasting that ability?”

“That is……”

Walter tried to speak as if to protest, but soon closed his mouth.

Roan quietly stared at such Walter.

“Walter, what do you think of your father, Kali Owells?”

Walter raised his head straight and answered without even a second of hesitation.

“He is a traitor, nothing more, nothing less, sir.”

Roan slightly nodded his head, then asked again.

“If you were to face him on the battlefield, would you be able to swing your sword without hesitation?”

As expected, Walter answered without a single second of hesitation.

“Of course, sir.”

Because he had such resolve, he had ignored even Kali’s summon and had remained in the Lancephil Guardian Army.

Because he had such resolve, he could bear even the comrades’ cold gazes.

‘The knight does not hold his sword upside down.’

That was Walter’s thought, and was Walter’s value.

Roan, with a satisfied expression, nodded his head.

“There is an order I will separately give to you.”

“Whatever order it is, I will follow, sir.”

Walter straightened his pose with a determined expression.

Roan stared straight into his eyes.

“It’s not an easy mission.”

It truly was not an easy mission.

However, it was a mission that couldn’t be done unless it was Walter.

Roan approached Walter one step closer and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Betray the Lancephil Guardian Army……”

The sharp words hit his ears, no, pierced his heart.

“And go to Kali Owells.”

*****

“Yawn. Tired, tired.”

The young soldiers yawned long.

The comrade that was nearby creased his forehead and spoke criticizing words.

“Get a hold of yourself.”

At those words, the soldier that had yawned shook his head as he smacked his lips.

“Smack, there’s no need to be too nervous like that. Here is a place that’s quite distant from even the front line.There’s almost no chance the Lancephil Guardian Army bastards would appear. Also, right now’s a pitch black twilight, a twilight.”

He looked up at the night sky and yawned long once again.

The soldier who made criticizing words spoke with a stiffly solidified expression.

“Haven’t you heard that news? The allied camp located at the west has been annihilated by the Lancephil Guardian Army’s raid attack. Recently, those bastards’ movements aren’t usual. And because of that, we even increased the number of guards like this.”

The Lancephil Guardian Army, which had been busy maintaining the frontline, began to move like a ghost since about four days ago.

“Nah, that are small-scale troop camps that was done in, and large-scale camps like us Nox Troop is safe. Unless those Lancephil Guardian Army guys go insane, they wouldn’t……”

When his words reached about that point.

Puuck!

With a horrifying sound, an arrow was stuck on the skull of the soldier who was chatting excitedly.

“Huph!”

The moment the soldier who had been listening to his story lowered his head with a surprised expression.

Puuck!

Again, a single arrow flew and pierced the soldier’s neck.

That was the start.

Pubuk! Pububububuk! Pubuk!

Crossing the night sky, tens, hundreds of fire arrows fell inside the Nox Troop’s camp.

Fwoosh!

Following the fences and the tents, flames bursted up.

The soldiers who were carrying out the sentry duties became porcupines and fell.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

Even in that while, the ones who barely survived hit the watchtower’s bell as hard as they could.

“Wha, what!”

“It’s the enemy!”

“It’s an enemy attack!”

The soldiers sprinted out of the tents and shouted.

However, the inside of the camp had, already, long turned into a sea of flames.

The soldiers fell into chaos.

At that moment.

Dudududududu!

As if it had been waiting, the sound of horse hooves ringing the ground were heard.

Boom!

The fences that had been barely standing with fire on shattered into pieces with a sound of explosion.

Through the gaps of fallen fences, a cavalry showed up.

Lancephil Guardian Army .

Pavor Academy Troop .

The highly soaring flag showed off its dignity.

“Kill them!”

“Tore apart the camp’s inside!”

The man standing at the head and leading the troop was Baron Andre Molde.

Following his command, hundreds of horsemen formed a group and pierced through the camp.

Following that back, hundreds of foot soldiers and archers showed themselves once again.

“Damn it! To think it’s the Lancephil Guardian Army!”

The Nox Troop’s commanders, who had appeared at the center of the camp a moment late, clenched their teeth tight.

Although they had reinforced the sentry soldiers because the Lancephil Guardian Army’s movements had been unusual recently, even so, there were feelings of doubt.

Although several small-scale troop’s camps had been defeated, they thought that they were different.

They hadn’t possibly thought that the Lancephil Guardian Army, made up of farmers, would raid a large-scale troop’s camp.

“Damn it! Put out the fire!”

“Form the battle lines! The bastards are farmers who haven’t properly held a spear once!”

“If we counter calmly, we can easily defeat them!”

The Nox Troop’s commanders shouted at the top of their lungs.

At that moment.

Fwooosh!

The flame that waved following the fences suddenly began to move peculiarly as if to dance.

Simultaneously.

Paat!

With a bright red flame, a single warhorse burst out in front of the commanders.

“Wha, what!”

The commanders shouted with befuddled expressions.

Following the black spear, a spearhead made of flames soared up.

The man who sat on the warhorse and slantly held the flaming spear.

The flames waved around him.

A phenomenal sight.

That brought to mind almost a master of fire, a monarch of flames.

“Pe, perhaps……”

One amongst the Nox Troop’s commanders stuttered words with a bleached white face.

“Th, the Crimson Ghost?”

The end of his voice severely shook.

At that sound, the nearby commanders as well as even the ordinary soldiers goggled their eyes and made shocked expressions.

“The Crimson Ghost?”

“Roan Lancephil he say?”

“How is Count Lancephil here?”

“Isn’t he supposed to be in the west right now?”

Including them, the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces knew of Roan as roaming the western frontline.

That man had abruptly appeared in the Landingham Region.

He had been leading the Guardian Army and stirring the eastern frontline.

As if he had been waiting, a resounding voice bursted out.

“I am Roan Lancephil!”

The man, Roan shook the Travias Spear in a long line.

Each time, a stream of fire crossed the night sky.

“I will leave those who surrender alive! But……”

Suddenly, an incredible flame soared up with him at the center.

Simultaneously, the flame that flowed along the Travias Spear struck the ground.

Boom!

With a sound of explosion, the surface of the earth flipped.

Roan glared at the Nox Troop’s soldiers while slantly holding the spear.

“I will kill all those who resist.”

He spoke in a horrifying voice.

An incredible pressure swept the battlefield.

“Uuhuk!”

“I, I surrender!”

Few soldiers threw down their weapons and kneeled down.

“You bastards! The enemy’s number is smaller than us!”

“Fight! Push them out!”

The commanders swung their swords and shouted.

Few soldiers, following the order, formed battle lines.

Roan looked at that sight and made a bitter smile.

The time to dance once again had come.

He raised the spear up high.

“Lancephil Guardian Army, Charge!”

As soon as the order fell, the Guardian Army’s soldiers, who had been tearing apart the camp, raised their weapons and pounced.

However, the thing that hit the Nox Troop ahead of them was.

Fwooosh!

The flame that extended long following the Travias Spear.

Boom!

And Roan, who brought to mind the flame itself.

Finally, not from the West where Jonathan and Kali was pouring all their concerns but from the completely unexpected East, the full-scale counterattack had began.

Together with a bright red flame.

Crimson Ghost (6) End.

Chapter 174




T/n: Late last Saturday and Tuesday Chapters double release. Sorry about the lateness. Juggling the first week back at college and translating has been more difficult than I expected.

On that note, IatM’s release schedule will change for now to 2 chapters per Tuesdays to fit my college schedule.

Around the time that Roan had began to seriously move at the northeastern frontline, one young man showed up at the main Owell Forces’ camp that had advanced all the way to the vicinity of the Pavor Castle.

A young man, although the tired look was apparent, whose eyes at least were fiercely alive, it was Walter Owells.

Receiving the guide of the Owells Forces’ major commanders, he headed towards the tent Viscount Kali Owells was staying.

“Have you come?”

When he entered the inside of the tent, Kali, who was sitting at the head seat, passed his greeting with a brusque voice.

Walter quietly stood and stared at Kali’s face, then slowly lowered his head.

“I was a little late, father.”

“A little late, is it…… you’ve became brazen during the time I haven’t seen you.”

Kali made a bitter smile.

If Walter wasn’t the eldest son who would lead the Owells House, he would have threw him out, but threw him out long ago.

Walter looked straight into Kali’s eyes.

“Father has aged while I haven’t seen you.”

He, even with Kali, an imperturbable opponent and an incredibly ambitious man, in front of him, didn’t step back a single step.

‘This brat……

Kali looked at Walter with a complicated light in his eyes.

From the time he was in the Pavor Academy, he was the son whose talent at least was chosen on a hand.

Because his character too was upright and excellent, he was a talent that Count Io Lancephil had greatly valued.

Walter was certainly the most qualified man who could revive the Owells House.

But.

‘He is too soft.’

He was a brat who was bounded by an empty thing called chivalry or whatnot.

Because of that, Walter had chosen not his father Kali but Io Lancephil in the current fief war.

‘That you have suddenly came finding me?’

It was natural that the intent was extremely suspicious.

“What’s the reason you suddenly changed your heart?”

What could have changed the resolved heart of his son?

If it wasn’t a proper reason, the possibility of it being a lie or a deceit was high.

Walter faintly smiled and answered.

“Having gotten old, it seems that even your ears have gone dark, father.”

Purposely scratching Kali’s ego, he spat out word by word as if to chew.

“Right now, Roan has appeared in the Landingham Region at northeast.”

“What?”

Kali’s face that had been maintaining the composed look abruptly crumpled.

‘The bastard is not at the west but northeast?’

In order to catch Roan, he had transferred the elite troop to the west.

That was not only the Owells Forces but the same for the Chase Legion.

But in actuality, Roan had showed up at a completely dubious place.

Walter sinisterly smiled and added on.

“The bastard has secretly appeared while bringing just a single retainer. Using that he himself is the new Count Lancephil, Roan instantly seized the Guardian Army.”

“Hmm.”

Kali creased his forehead.

His chest felt stifled.

‘Does it mean he has taken even the Guardian Army into his grasp?’

t felt as if the things were becoming more and more complicated.

Even so, Kali tried to maintain his calm.

‘Either way, I also have to destroy the Guardian Army bastards.’

He laboriously calmed his breath and looked at Walter.

“And what’s the relation between that and you changing your heart?”

“There’s a very big relation.”

Walter instantly answered, then added on with a cold expression.

“I wish to serve Sir Count Io Lancephil, not serve Roan Lancephil. Word for word, he is no different than a stone that rolled in. There is no way for me to lower my head towards a bastard who’s even background is vague.”

“Hmm.”

Kali leaked a quiet groan.

Walter’s thoughts of Roan was the same as Kali’s thoughts.

‘He has rose up in fear of the Lancephil fief and the title going over to the lowly bastard.’

Ultimately, Io, as according to Kali’s prediction, transferred the fief and the title to Roan.

He slowly nodded his head.

“And what do you plan to do from now on?”

Kali thought to check over his son Walter’s intentions.

Walter coldly smiled and answered.

“Either way, Lancephil fief and the title have went over to Roan. Now the Count Lancephil House isn’t the house I was going to serve. Now that it became like this……”

His eyes flashed and shone a light.

“I also plan to look at a much higher place, father.”

“A higher place, is it……?”

Kali hesitated the end of his words and looked at Walter.

Walter slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. When even a lowly bastard becomes a count, there shouldn’t be any reason that even I can’t become one.”

At those words, Kali made a satisfied expression.

‘This is it. This is it. The look I wanted was exactly this.’

He wished that his son Walter would have a little bigger ambition.

Kali stood up from his seat and grabbed Walter’s shoulder.

“Walter.”

“Yes. Father.”

The two people’s gazes blazingly tangled.

Strength kept going into the father’s hand holding the son’s shoulder.

Kali, in a quiet and powerful voice, spoke.

“The very final viscount of the Owells House is I.”

An incredible energy spouted out from his entire body.

“Walter Owells. You……”

They were words exhaled as if to declare.

“Become the first count of the Owells House.”

*****

“Sir, we have conquered the Labenum Castle.”

Baron Bernard Landingham looked at the rampart where the Lancephil Guardian Army’s flag went up and formed a smile.

Roan, who had waged a fierce battle at the frontline until just now, spat out a short breath.

“It was easier than expected.”

At those words, Bernard smiled much brighter and answered.

“As the tales of Guardian Army’s achievements spread, the citizens of the fief and the preexisting retainers that shrunk are responding, sir.”

“On top of that, the spirits have went up even more as the West and Southern Center’s Tale Legion won consecutive victories.”

“Several small castles’ lords are personally attacking the Owells Forces, sir.”

Numerous commanders echoed and cheered.

At that moment, Baron Andre Molde, who had personally raised the legion’s flag, rode his horse and approached.

“We have carefully inspected the surrendered men and organized them into a new legion, sir.”

“Good work.”

Roan shortly thanked him and nodded his head.

Andre looked at the Lancephil Guardian Army that had took place on the field outside the castle and let out a short exclamation.

“As we undergo more and more battles, the number of our soldiers isn’t decreasing, but rather increasing greatly, sir.”

At those words, Bernard cut in.

“Since we let those who surrender live and give them a new chance, while cutting the necks of those who resist without exception.”

Another commander continued on his words.

“The ones who are afraid of death are surrendering even before fighting, sir.”

Thanks to that, a large number of uninjured soldiers were joining the Guardian Army.

This too was one of Roan’s aims.

The ones who surrender can live.

As such rumor spread, the ones who became afraid at Roan’s fame chose surrender without hesitation.

At that moment, one commander bitterly smiled and spat out a sarcastic sound.

“To betray without even knowing that the situation would flow like this. Hmph! Well, I did know he would do that.”

A loud sound of snort hit the ears.

Andre, who was staring at the Lebenum Castle with a satisfied expression, creased his forehead.

“Is that talking of the Walter bastard?”

His voice was edged.

The commander who snorted, with a slightly flustered expression, nodded his head.

“Eh? Yes. That is correct, sir.”

The instant his answer ended, Andre spoke with a stiffly solidified expression.

“Don’t even speak of that trash-like bastard. You cannot fool one’s blood. There is no way that the son bastard would be okay when his father Kali is like that. If I meet that bastard on the battlefield……”

He lightly tapped the scabbard at his waist.

“I will cut his neck with this sword.”

“O, of course, sir. You will definitely be able to do it.”

The commander awkwardly smiled and echoed.

Roan, looking at that sight, inwardly let out a long sigh.

There was an unspeakable ache inside him.

‘To fool the shrewd Kali and Jonathan, I must fool my allies first.’

Infiltration of Kali’s Owells Forces was one of the most major strategies that could flip the state of the war.

For the perfect success, he had to strictly protect the secret even from the ally commanders.

‘Because of that, I said that it won’t be an easy mission.’

It was a mission that one had to infiltrate the enemy camp and fight a lonely fight for the allies even while enduring the allies’ jeers and furious looks.

However, Walter readily accepted that mission.

‘Walter. If this event ends, I will definitely grant a great reward.’

When his thought reached about that point.

“The birds have arrived, sir!”

One of the commanders pointed at the sky and shouted.

Above their heads, various birds had already gathered.

They were the messenger birds and the spy-use birds Agens and the Tenebra Troop used.

Roan extended his right arm to called an eagle, then untied the long tube tied to its ankle.

A small paper that words had tightly filled appeared.

He read the letter for a long while, then snapped his fingers.

Boosh.

With a spark, the letter burned up.

In an instant, the top secret document turned into ashen dust.

Roan looked at the commanders including Bernard and Andre and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Ready to march.”

His gaze headed not towards the west but towards the south.

“We march south.”

It was completely different than the direction they had marched until now.

However, not a single one asked back with a puzzled look.

They knew.

That the road is not inside the map but within the direction Roan looked.

*****

“It has been a while.”

It was a husky voice.

Four canines that sharply rose roughly moved.

“Have you been well, sir?”

The person who passed his greeting with a composed expression was Chris.

“There’s no way I’ve been well.”

The voice fully rubbed off with annoyance.

Once again, the four canines that sharply rose roughly moved.

The being that sat opposite Chris and conversed was not a human.

An Orc.

And it was the tribe head Marrak of the Auraq tribe that was known to be quite strong within the Byron Kingdom’s southern regions at that.

Chris and Marrak.

Human and Orc.

A relation that seemed to have absolutely no connection.

But surprisingly, the two people, no, the two were acquaints who were quite close.

‘Since we’ve been trading from the time the Istel Kingdom and the Byron Kingdom invaded the Rinse Kingdom.’

At the time, Chris had received Roan’s order and went around searching for the orc tribes that were spread out in the Byron Kingdom’s southern region with his life on the line.

The orcs, who were fleeing to this and that place due to the Byron Kingdom’s extensive subjugation and an extreme food shortage, did not welcome Chris’ visit.

It was a situation where the head could fly off if he spoke a single word wrong.

However, Chris stayed calm.

Using the card he held, food assistance, he seated the orcs on the negotiation table.

‘Since we would give them food assistance, to be exact tell them the location of the Byron Kingdom’s provisions storage, we asked them to attack and pillage those places.’

He also made them a promise to separately aid them food if things did not become solved as planned.

The orcs, who were suffering from the extreme food shortage, instantly accepted Chris’ offer.

Then, they raided the rear provisions storage of the Byron Kingdom, which had been fiercely pushing the Rinse Kingdom.

Thanks to that.

‘The Byron Kingdom army gave up the war and could only retreat.’

And as one of the allied army’s pivots stepped back, the Istel Kingdom army too, which had been carrying out arduous battle even without that, could only retreat.

‘If I think about it now, it truly was a reckless plan.’

It was good that it were resolved well, but if things did not go as planned, his head could have ran away the moment he visited the orc tribes.

Since the orcs at the time were at that degree of a frenzied state.

Chris looked at Marrak and made a faint smile.

‘It was thanks to Marrak.’

He, unlike the harsh look, was an orc who was quite conversable.

Chris, with a short sigh, opened his mouth.

“As expected, is the reason you aren’t well because of Baron Noel Kyword?”

The instant his words ended.

Boom!

Marrak harshly slammed down on the wooden desk.

“That damnable human bitch!”

The four canines greatly shook and then a curse jumped out.

Baron Noel Kyword.

The hero who saved the Byron Kingdom from the crisis of national ruin.

He was the individual who had once allied with Istel Kingdom’s Viscount Peid Neil and attacked Pershion Kingdom in the past.

Although there were significantly many achievements he had raised, the one that received the biggest appraisal amongst them was the very work of subjugating the orc tribes of Byron Kingdom’s southern region.

In Marrak’s position, he was no different than a sworn enemy.

No, not only Marrak, but the orcs of the Byron Kingdom’s southern region grinded their canines and raged at the mention of Noel Kyword.

“Due to that chewable bitch running around, my people are starving to death.”

Marrak growled and showed his anger.

Chris stealthly nodded his head.

‘As expected, it is so.’

It was as the information Agens had collected.

Then.

‘The work should be resolved easier than I thought.’

He, with a serious expression with effort, passed words of consolation.

“That truly is a tragic event.”

Then soon, in a small and covert voice, added on.

“If it’s somehow okay, may we provide you some aid?”

“An aid?”

Marrak forcefully sank his rage and asked.

Chris nodded his head.

“Yes. As urgently, we will provide you the rations we are reserving.”

“Oh!”

Marrak roundly opened his mouth and exclaimed.

He fully opened his arms.

“That truly are thankful words!”

Marrak fussed as if to at least immediately hug Chris into his chest.

At that moment, Chris, who was smiling brightly, suddenly creased his forehead.

“Ah! But there is one problem.”

“A problem? What problem?”

Marrak creased his forehead.

The elated feeling flew away in an instant.

Chris hesitated for a long while as if his worry was deep, then carefully answered.

“Our side’s food storehouse is in the Tale Region, but if we were to transport the food from there to all the way here, we must pass through the Chase County. But right now, the Count Lancephil House and the Count Chase House are fighting a fief war. With the current state, there is no way that Count Chase would let our side’s people pass through.”

“Oh no……”

Marrak exhaled a sigh.

The mean to solve the food shortage had turn into a bubble.

On his face, a downhearted look was clear.

At that moment, Chris spoke in a quiet voice.

“But even so, it isn’t as if there is truly no way.”

“Oh! Does that mean that there is a way?”

Marrak once again made a bright smile.

As befitting an orc, his change in emotion was extreme.

Chris cheerily smiled and nodded his head.

“Yes. That is……”

The Decisive Battle (1) End.

Chapter 175




T/n: IatM’s release schedule will be changed to 2 chapters per week on Tuesdays. So hopefully, do please expect double chapters next Tuesday.

Roan’s fierce counterattack that began with the west and the northeast as the center.

Count Jonathan Chase was awfully displeased.

‘By now, I should be holding a toast at Io bastard’s fief lord’s castle, but……’

Uddk.

The teeth naturally gritted.

But even so, it wasn’t as if the war situation was awfully disadvantageous.

Although there were more cases of losing than cases of winning at the western and northeastern frontlines, the central side where the main army was located was achieving sweeping victories.

‘Even so, the things not going as desired is still annoying and displeasing.’

He felt like killing Roan by ripping his four limbs apart if he was in front of his eyes.

‘If the reinforcement comes from the fief, I should combine strength with the Owells Forces and clean up the western frontline first.’

If he were to clean up the west, which was the rear battlefield, continuing the fief war would become much easier.

Within his head, various plans were raised.

At that moment.

“My lord!”

With an urgent voice, Baron Holt Edemil, who was one of Jonathan’s close-aides, entered into the tent.

“What is it?”

Jonathan creased his brows.

He felt a foreboding feeling.

Holt panted breathlessly and quickly answered.

“An urgent letter has arrived from the fief! O, orc! The orc bastards have began to move, sir!”

“Orc?!”

Jonathan abruptly stood up and shouted.

It was a completely unexpected report.

‘Orc? Even though orcs in our fief as well as the kingdom’s southern regions have been mostly subjugated?’

It was a situation where even the ones who barely survived had ran away towards the Grain Mountains.

The orcs left in the Chase County was a very minute number.

It wasn’t a number that would cause a disturbance nor mayhem.

‘Even though it was one of the reasons I waged the fief war without worry……’

The inside of his head became complicated.

Holt took out and passed the letter from his chest pocket, then quickly added on.

“The bastards spread out at the Byron Kingdom’s South have began to move, my lord.”

“Hmm. To think it would be Byron Kingdom’s South……’

Jonathan’s face comically twisted.

He quickly read down the content written in the letter.

A moment later.

“For now, it isn’t that they have crossed the border?”

Jothan, with a short sigh, asked with a relieving look.

Holt nodded his head.

“Yes. They are staying at the buffer zone, my lord.”

“Hhm. That at least is good, but……”

Jonathan, as he put down the letter, asked with a stiffly solidified expression.

“The Northern Regional Corp’s reaction?”

The Chase County’s northern border region was the jurisdiction of the Northern Regional Corps.

Holt momentarily hesitated, then answered in a careful voice.

“For now, they are focusing their military strength at the border gate and the cities. But they said that they would leave the defense inside the fief to our……”

When his words reached about that point.

Boom!

Jonathan couldn’t hold in and slammed his desk.

“Arrogant sons of bitches.”

The Northern Regional Corps Supreme Commander was, as an individual belonging to the neutral faction, an inflexible man.

His personality that was one that was only devoted to the assigned mission and action.

‘He will only focus on border defense as the Northern Regional Corps, is it.’

Meaning that the fief lord should take responsibility for his fief’s safety.

Jonathan tightly bit his lower lips.

Holt momentarily searched the mood, then cautiously opened his mouth.

“Should we pass the news to the capital?”

If the news was passed to the capital, they would dispatch the Central Corps or the knight order.

No, even in the worst case scenario, subjugating something like the orcs wasn’t even a work with only the reinforcement of nobles with close relationships.

However, Jonathan shook his head with a stiffly solidified expression.

“Absolutely not. The moment the news is passed to the capital, the fief war will end.”

They still hadn’t wholly conquered the Lancephil Fief.

If the fief war ended like this, there would be nothing that remained in his hand.

“Since I’ll separately send a letter to the princes for now, you thoroughly monitor the Northern Regional Corps so that their report can’t go up.”

“Eh? But monitoring the entire Northern Regional Corps is almost impossible……”

“It’s twenty days. You only need to monitor them for just twenty days. Since the fief war will end before that.”

Jonathan fiercely glared with his eyes.

Holt momentarily hesitated, then soon nodded his head.

“Yes. Understood, my lord. Then……”

He calmed his breath for a moment, then asked in a quiet voice.

“What do you plan to do for the fief side’s defense, my lord?”

Since the Northern Regional Corps had pushed off the fief’s defense, the Count Chase House too had to make its own preparation.

Jonathan contemplated for a moment, then answered with a scowling face.

“Send the reinforcement to the northern border region. We will proceed the fief war with our current military strength.”

At the abrupt situation, Jonathan couldn’t make the correct judgment.

If he had normal reasoning, he had to end the fief war here and step back.

However, his greed and ambition had paralyzed his reasons.

Holt looked at such Jonathan for a moment, then soon exhaled a short sigh.

‘Sir Count’s order is absolute.’

He had gave up remonstrating.

This exactly was Count Jonathan Chase’s biggest problem.

That there was no retainer who could speak forthright or remonstrate and catch and correct his mistakes.

Around him, only treacherous retainers who only echoed and flattered at ambition and greed were plenty.

Holt deeply lowered his head.

“Then I will cancel the reinforcement request, sir.”

“Hurry.”

Jonathan waved his right hand.

It was a sign chasing him out.

Holt once again gave his farewell and then exited to the outside of the tent.

Jonathan, who was left alone, spat out a long sigh.

‘To think it would abruptly be orcs at such time……’

He completely couldn’t think that the orcs of the Byron Kingdom’s southern region had possibly received Roan’s instigation and moved.

‘So it’s a situation that I can’t expect the reinforcement. Can’t be helped……’

With the situation becoming like this, Jonathan too had to make a winning move.

‘For now, I will have to call the Owells Forces.’

Currently, the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces were each moving separately.

But with Roan’s entering of the fief war, Lancephil Guardian Army’s counterattack, the orcs’ stirring and such, the board was greatly shaking.

‘We’ll combine the strengths into one and see the victory and defeat within a quick time.’

A horrifying light hung on his eyes.

‘I will make the strategies and tactics worthless.’

He had no thought of particularly fighting head on with wits.

It was a thought to literally and violently push.

However, Jonathan did not quite knew.

Of the truth that Roan’s strategies and tactics were much more varied than he thought, and that they had already lowered their roots to the point deep enough to decide the victory and defeat.

*****

‘Kinis!’

[Got it!]

At Roan’s shout, Kinis extended her arms towards the front.

Suddenly, a stream of water soared up from the moats deeply dug around the castle wall.

Tat!

Roan kicked off the ground and jumped into the air.

Lightly, he climbed up onto the stream.

Pabat!

Following Kinis’ hand gesture, the column of water soared all the way to above the castle wall.

“Oh!”

“It’s the lord!”

The Lancephil Guardian Army’s soldiers, who had been attacking the castle, cheered.

Through numerous battles, they came to know the truth that Roan can not only freely control fire but even water.

Of course, they didn’t exactly know even how such thing was possible.

Simply, they thought that it was one of the many abilities Roan had and awed.

Roan once again stamped his feet and then climbed up onto the castle wall.

“Kill them!”

“Stop him!”

“That very bastard is Roan!”

“The fief war will end if we just catch that bastard!”

The Chase Legion’s soldiers on the rampart ran towards Roan.

Their eyes were colored red.

It was a reckless attack.

“Fools!”

With a thunderous roar, Roan threw his body.

The Travias Spear cut the air as if to dance.

Ssskuk! Sssguk!

With a horrifying sound, the common soldiers’ necks and limbs were cut apart.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

They weren’t Roan’s match.

Following the spearhead, fire surged.

“Oh!”

The Lancephil Guardian Army’s soldiers, who were staring from below the castle wall at the chaotic fight above the remparts, exploded out with exclamation.

Every time the flame surged, the enemy soldiers fell.

The sight of driving away hundreds of soldiers alone almost brought a god of war to mind.

“Damn it! Move aside!”

At that moment, people dressed up in brilliant armor showed up together with a roar.

Knights of the Chase Legion.

Swinging the swords that fully held mana, they pressed Roan.

Ssuung! Ssuung!

Sharp sounds of splitting the air hit the ears.

Certainly, knights were different than common soldiers.

However, Roan’s expression was relaxed as ever.

‘Good. I have lured the knights, who are the core military strength, to above the castle walls.’

Now was the time to execute the next plan.

He cheerily smiled and stepped back.

“Are you running away!”

The knights loudly sneered and attack much more fiercely.

Roan, instead of an answer, widely swung his spear and kicked off the castle wall.

Paat!

Lightly, he jumped down towards the ground inside the castle.

“Insane!”

“A suicide?!”

Because the height of the wall was incredible, even the knights who had learned the mana techniques couldn’t carelessly jump down.

The Chase Legion’s knights and the soldiers who had been watching all made dumbfound expressions.

Suddenly.

Paat!

The Travias Spear extended longly and hit the ground.

Puuk!

In an instant, the spearhead pierced and planted all the way to a place deep within the ground.

Sssg!

Holding the spear like a pillar, Roan softly stepped down on top of the ground.

“Eh?! Wha, what?!”

“Stop him!”

“Kill him!”

Looking at Roan who suddenly fell down from the sky, the Chase Legion’s soldiers that were blocking the castle gate from the inside were startled back.

“Move aside.”

Roan pulled the heat with the Flamdor Mana Technique, then kicked the ground.

Fwoooosh!

A blaze surged following the spearhead and the spear.

“Uhuk!”

“Kuk!”

The common soldiers screamed at the incredible heat and ran away in every direction.

Roan, instead of chasing them, stepped into the inner side of the castle gate, then swung his spear towards the stakes that fixed the gate.

Boom! Kwakkang!

With a sound of an explosion, the thick wooden stakes and the iron stakes exploded apart.

Just like that, Roan pushed the gate.

Ggiiiik!

With the sound of wood twisting, the castle gate opened.

The scenery outside the castle came in a glance.

The Lancephil Guardian Army, due to the wide and deeply dug moat following the castle wall, were troubled.

Roan quickly twisted his wrist.

Sssguk!

The spearhead split the air and instantly cut the line that was tightly pulling up the drawbridge.

Boom!

With a heavy sound, a bridge was set above the moat.

“The drawbridge has came down!”

“The gate has opened!”

“Charge! Charge!”

The Lancephil Guardian Army’s commanders, who were frustrated at the siege that wasn’t as easy as they thought, raised their swords as they looked at the widely open gate.

‘He is an incredible man!’

‘He’s truly an incredible person!’

Baron Bernard Landingham and Baron Andre Molde, even while charging towards the castle gate, couldn’t hide their shocked expressions.

Roan boldly stood in front of the wide open gate.

An incredible spirit and dignity stormed.

‘As expected, he is the man who Sir Io chose and his majesty the king has acknowledged.’

Bernard felt his heart beating greatly.

He was a man whom he couldn’t dare compare with himself.

A thought that he did well to recognize Roan and lower his head a much early was had.

Abruptly, he was curios of Andre’s facial expression.

When he furtively turned his head, a brightly blushed face was seen.

That was an awfully embarrassed look.

‘Just what did I call myself to test such a man?’

His face burned up.

‘It would be good if I earnestly aid him at least from now on.’

It was a look of greatly reflecting on the past day’s arrogance and self-indulgence.

On the hand holding the rein, strength went in.

Dudududududu!

He placed a spur onto the sprinting horse.

Already, Roan was in front of their noses.

“Lancephil Guardian Army!”

Roan, as if he had been waiting, raised up the Travias Spear high.

“Charge!”

He kicked the ground and jumped towards the inside of the castle.

A blaze surged along the tip of the spear.

Thousands of Lancephil Guardian Army followed that back.

A flame and a legion.

That brilliance swallowed a castle whole.

*****

“Consecutive victories you say?”

The tips of Kali Owells’ mouth lightly went up.

“Yes. He fought seven times and won all seven times, sir.”

The man presenting the report was one of Owells Forces’ commanders, Demis Izy.

Because he was able to pass a good news for a change, his mood was good.

“There is also his talent, but certainly, it is definite that he has a bad feeling towards Roan and the Lancephil Guardian Army, sir.”

“That’s good.”

Kali coldly smiled as he nodded his head.

He momentarily organized his thoughts, then looked at Demis.

“Would it be okay if we soon entrust an important duty on him?”

The instant his words finished, Demis nodded his head.

“Yes, sir. If it is Sir Walter as of now, it seems that we could even trust and leave things to him.”

Kali and Demis, the two people were sharing a conversation about Walter Owells.

Walter was, after receiving Roan’s secret mission and joining the Owells Forces, was neatly piling up military achievements.

Although there were also achievements he piled up using his own abilities, most of them were achievements he had received Roan’s help and raised.

In any case, at the victories that continued on, even the Owells Forces’ commanders who first doubted Walter were now all sending their intents of support.

Kali faintly smiled and made the decision.

“Good. Then I will have a troop newly organized and leave the northeastern frontline to him.”

“Yes sir. I will pass it on like that.”

Demis quickly made a salute and answered.

Kali proudly smiled and closed his eyes.

‘Even if it wasn’t so, it is a situation where I have to move to the west in order to join up with the Chase Legion.’

Even though the northeastern frontline was a worry, since Walter was doing well for him, he felt that it would be okay to trust and leave it to him.

‘That brat. He ate my heart out like that, then became a big help.’

For once after a long time, his heart felt truly satisfied and proud.

For some reason, it felt like he could gain a good result even in the current fief war.

‘Yes. We will spread the name of the Owells House to the entire kingdom.’

He had the confidence to do so.

If he himself and Walter, the two people combined their strengths, they would be able to aim for even above Count House.

Certainly, Kali was an amazingly ambitious man.

But even if he was so, merely a count was the limit of that goal.

In the first place, the size of the plate itself was different with Roan.

Since Roan’s goal was a monarch.

The Decisive Battle (2) End.

Chapter 176




T/n: A bit late Tuesday’s Chapter. I’ll have ch. 177 up as soon as possible, sometime tomorrow morning at the latest. Sorry about the lateness. I’m still getting used to new semester at college, but hopefully I should have everything set by next week.

“Just what are they planning, sir?”

Rinse Kingdom Northern Regional Corp’s Stoneham Border Gate soldier Campbell stared at the buffer zone and creased his brows.

The scene outside the border gate was brutal.

Between the bleak hills and plains, big and small orc troops had taken place.

It literally was the situation right before a battle would arise.

But strangely, the orcs merely walked up close to the gate to shout and sing, and did not make any recognizable attack.

Stoneham Border Gate Captain Heinz, who was glaring at the orcs from a watchtower, snorted.

“Hmph. Just where would there be a plan in those stupid monsters?”

A cold smile hung around his mouth.

“They got afraid at our defense forces and aren’t being able to carelessly approach.”

“Is it like that, sir?”

Campbell tilted his head and stared at the outside of the border gate.

‘It looks like they absolutely don’t have a desire to fight though……’

He wasn’t talking of the troop’s movements or the camps’ arrangements.

The unique air that could be felt at the battlefields, that of a troop facing a battle, wasn’t felt.

Orcs were, as if.

‘They look as if they came out on an outing or something.’

But this was only Campbell’s thought.

He couldn’t repeatedly raise a question to Heinz, who stressed the hierarchy of command.

‘Well, it’s fine for me if a battle doesn’t happen.’

He decided to simply think well and easy of it.

But even so, the somehow uneasy feeling couldn’t be helped.

“Huu.”

A quiet sigh flowed out on its own.

At the same time as him, there was one who was exhaling a long sigh outside the border gate also.

He was Gank, a prominent warrior of the Auraq Tribe and the one who acted as the tribe head Marrak’s right-hand man.

“Huu.”

A sigh continued once again.

Marrak, who was raising a cheap drink next to him, creased his brows.

“Gank. Why are you sighing like that?”

They were words spat out as if to grumble.

Gank stared at the Stoneham Border Gate for a moment, then answered in a gruff voice.

“Tribe Head. Are we really going to keep staying like this?”

At those words, Marrak snickered and filled his cup.

“Hah, I was wondering what it was. We only have to intimidate them.”

He crudely emptied his cup, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

“Burp.”

A burp popped out.

“Since it’ll be difficult if a battle needlessly and actually happens, just control the guys properly.”

“Ghn.”

With an uncomfortable expression, Gank leaked groaned.

He stared straight at Marrak’s eyes.

“We can capture that level of gate even with our current strength.”

“Ah hah, you really don’t listen.”

Marrak put down the cup and stood up from his seat.

Although Gank too was of a big size that wasn’t light, he was on the small side compared to Marrak.

Unconsciously, he shrank back his neck.

Marrak pressed Gank’s shoulder and stared at the Stoneham Border Gate.

“Don’t you remember the words Chris said? He said that the fief war will end the instant we chop those bastards and capture the gate. Our role is merely……”

“Holding on the bastards’ ankles……”

Gank finished the sentence.

With an expression saying ‘right’, Marrak tapped Gank’s shoulder.

“So go shout or sing a song when it’s time. Go fly some arrows at the wall if you are really bored.”

“Ghn. Understood.”

Gank lowered his head as if to say it couldn’t be helped, then returned to his tent.

Marrak stared at his back, then snickered out a laugh.

“You brat. Just wait a bit more. Since I’ll give you a chance to fight as much as you want.”

A weighty smile hung around his mouth.

He rolled and rolled again his solidly stiffen head this way and that.

“Although getting the human bastards’ help is also good, but……”

The four canines crudely moved.

“Huhuhu. As expected, orcs must be like orcs.”

A killing intent flowed in his eyes.

But Marrak soon shooked his head back and forth and grabbed his cup.

“Let’s wait a bit more. A bit more.”

He laboriously cooled his boiling heart.

But on his eyes, the skill intent was still flowing.

*****

“It has been a while. Is it the first after the fief war started?”

The person who extended his hand as he faintly smiled was Count Jonathan Chase.

“Yes. Since the direction we each marched was different, sir.”

The one lightly grabbing that hand was Kali Owells.

Finally, Kali had led the Owells Forces and had joined up with the Chase Legion.

“Anyhow, it’s nice to see you.”

Jonathan sat down on his seat and shook his right hand.

A beauty who it was hard to tell whether she had worn or taken off clothes came up and filled wine into the empty cup.

Soon, a simple table of snacks and fruits were set.

It wasn’t an ordinary sight that could be seen in the middle of a battlefield.

Jonathan, while holding his cup, looked at Kali.

“You left the northeastern frontline to your son, you say?”

“Yes.”

A short answer.

“Can he be trusted? You haven’t abruptly entrusted an important duty to him because of a reason that he is your son, no?”

Jonathan’s gaze was sharp.

However, Kali did not quail a bit.

He answered with a composed voice.

“I am not of a personality that would trust and leave an important duty because of reason that he is my son. It is something I have decided after meticulously checking him, sir.”

It was the true to a certain degree.

It was something unknown whether he would had thrown Walter away from the start if the abilities and talent he had was pitiful.

Of course, though the point that he was the firstborn who would lead the house also couldn’t be ignored.

“You probably took care of it well yourself.”

Jonathan cheerily smiled and nodded his head.

“Anyhow, I’ll be counting on you from now on.”

Now was the time they had to move not as two but as one.

Kali faintly smiled and lowered his head.

“Rather, I would like to ask well of you, sir.”

A warm mood.

But below that, a mood horrifying like a blade was flowing.

‘This bastard. He isn’t one who would stay below anyone.’

Jonathan realized that Kali’s ambition was much greater than he had thought.

That was truly an easy thing.

‘He is a bastard like me.’

Jonathan and Kali were, even if they were similar, much too similar.

However, Jonathan did now betray his heart.

He still needed Kali.

He began to spread out the plans he had thought up ahead of time.

“For now, let’s clean up the western frontline’s Tale Legion.”

“Yes. Since the northeast’s Lancephil Guardian Army is a gang made up of farmers.”

If they were to particularly decide the work’s order, the west was the first rather than the northeast.

Moreover, the time left until the fief war’s end wasn’t a lot.

A blitzkrieg.

It was a thought to subjugate the Tale Legion in an instant and then suppress the western frontline.

However, they did not quite know.

That the Tale Legion, no, the western frontline they were aiming at had already disappeared and was gone.

*****

“By the way, why are we keep on going towards the south?”

“You’re right. Isn’t the Pavor Castle in the west?”

“Don’t know. Since we merely do as they ordered from above.”

Three-four soldiers busily moved their feet and chatted in a small voice.

At that moment, a young adjutant who was moving while riding a horse to the left and right of the line came up tightly close.

“Has Sir Count ever done something pointless?”

“No sir.”

The soldiers immediately shook their heads.

It wasn’t a question that needed to be contemplated.

The young adjutant faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Then trust and follow. For the reason we go south is because the road is there.”

Voice filled with certainty.

The young adjutant raised his head and looked at the head of the march.

Flags raised high.

Lancephil Guardian Army.

Roan Lancephil.

Below that, Roan Lancephil was moving while riding on a warhorse.

Currently, the Lancephil Guardian Army was marching not westward but southward.

It was a course difficult to understand.

But even so, excluding a few minor soldiers, most people did not hold question at Roan’s decision.

They had came to recognize Roan’s ability through the repeating battles and victories.

Like that, the Lancephil Guardian Army’s march south continued.

After an unknown distance marched.

A cool wind flowed at the tip of their noses.

Simultaneously, a blue line of river spread in front of their eyes.

And.

“Ah! Those are……?”

Baron Andre Molde, who acted as the Guardian Army’s scout and moved the most ahead, exclaimed.

At the place the blue river and the brown-color sand met.

Following the long riverside, tens of warships were moored.

The giant flag hanging on the center mast fluttered in the wind.

Tale Legion.

The Lancephil Guardian Army’s soldiers, who had climbed up onto the hill a moment later, goggled their eyes.

“How is Tale Legion……”

“Weren’t they at the west?”

When everyone whispered with confused looks, a group ran towards the hill from the ships.

The group, which had instantly closed the distance and approached, soon got down from their horses and saluted.

“Sir! We greet Sir Count.”

Resounding voices and bold looks.

A perfectly ordered sight.

They were the Tale Legion’s commanders, including Austin, Semi, and Austin.

The tip of Roan’s mouth softly went up.

“You arrived as the schedule.”

“Yes sir. As you have ordered, we moved under the cover of the dark. Excluding Brian and the troop below him located at the western end, the entire Tale Legion has arrived safely.”

Austin reported.

Roan, with a proud expression, nodded his head.

“You have done well. I will immediately hold a meeting of the commanders.”

“Yes. We shall prepare it, sir.”

Austin quickly answered, then sent a hand signal.

Already, the Tale Legion had perfectly set its system.

The thousand-man rank commanders rapidly and perfectly executed the order.

‘Is this that very Tale Legion?’

‘The most powerful of the powerful army that won countless victories in numerous battles.’

Baron Bernard Landingham and Baron Andre Molde inwardly exclaimed greatly.

At that moment, Austin and Semi saluted towards Bernard and Andre.

“I am Austin, Tale Legion’s vice-commander and the Piedes Troop’s three-thousand-man commander, sir.”

“Sir, I am Semi, Tale Legion’s vice-commander and the Impasse Troop’s three-thousand-man commander.”

Bernard and Andre, at the abrupt greetings, quickly lowered their heads.

“I am Bernard Lancephil Guardian Army’s Bernard Landingham.”

“I’m Lancephil Guardian Army’s Andre Molde.”

Although they were nobles, they couldn’t thoughtlessly speak down on Austin and Semi.

The position called the vice-commander of a legion, and the one that led Count Roan Lancephil’s legion at that wasn’t a level that one could face informally.

Roan lightly glanced at the four people, then pulled his rein.

“Then should we go to the meeting room?”

“Yes. I will lead the way, sir.”

The one who quickly got on a warhorse was Harrison.

Soon, with him at the head, numerous commanders’ movement began.

Simultaneously, the Lancephil Guardian Army’s soldiers, who had done a difficult march over a long time, also received the guide of the Tale Legion’s soldiers and were able to take a sweet time to rest for once.

The moment the Owells Forces and the Chase Legion joined up.

Not at the west, but in the south as well, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Guardian army, which had been far apart, came to combine their strengths.

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Guardian Army against the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces.

As if they had planned with each other, each side’s two pivotal legions came together under a single flag.

Of course, although this was all a board that Roan and his retainers had made, unfortunately, Jonathan and Kali weren’t able to guess such truth at all.

*****

“I reorganize the Lancephil Guardian Army as the Lancephil Legion and appoint Bernard and Andre as the vice-commanders as well as five-thousand-man commanders.”

At Roan’s words, all retainers lowered their heads.

Because it was the result that had came out after a long debate and mediation, there was no one who opposed or spoke complaints.

Furthermore, it merely sounds five-thousand-man commander, and the soldiers Bernard and Andre actually commanded was not quite three thousand.

By that much, Lancephil Legion’s numbers was a level that was yet absurdly lacking to be called a legion.

‘Since we also left a troop at the northeastern frontline, it can’t be helped.’

But even so, it wasn’t as if the Lancephil Guardian Army’s strength was also completely a mess.

Because the Pavor Academy’s graduates and students were composed, even though their numbers were small, they showed off a rather powerful might.

“Then are we marching northwest from now on towards the Pavor Castle, sir?”

When Austin cautiously asked, Roan slowly nodded his head.

“It would be a fierce march like a blaze. With the Pavor Castle as the starting point, I plan to completely reclaim the eastern region.”

If they could only and perfectly reclaim the eastern region according to the plan, the frontline that would be left was only one place.

It was the western frontline, where the Chase Legion, who receded to the rear saying they will subjugate the Tale Legion, and the Owells Forces were located.

At that moment, Andre spoke up with a stiffly solidified expression.

“It would be good if things go according to the plan, but Walter Owells is there on the northeastern frontline, sir.”

“Ah! Right. There is that bastard.”

Bernard creased his forehead and echoed.

With a voice full of annoyance and anger, Andre added on.

“Although I do not wish to admit it, but that traitor bastard’s abilities are quite excellent. In fact, the northeastern frontline’s Lancephil Guardian Army is having a large and difficult battle.”

As long as Walter is there, completely capturing the eastern region with the Pavor Castle as the starting point would not be so easy.

Instead, it could become a situation where they would have to fight while having an enemy troop at their back.

Everyone made worried expression.

However, Roan at least was greatly relaxed and composed.

“There is nothing to worry of Walter.”

If he could, he wished to reveal that he was his man.

‘It isn’t the time yet.’

He inwardly shook his head.

At least until they brought down one of the enemy forces’ pivots, he thought to protect the secret.

“He isn’t such an easy bastard, sir.”

Only Andre, who did not knew the truth, was frustrated.

Roan faintly smiled and tapped his chest with his right hand.

“Trust me.”

His voice was filled with certainty.

When it came to this point, Andre too couldn’t speak up the same words anymore.

It was also the same for the other retainers.

Roan looked at such retainers for a moment, then shook his forefinger at Austin.

Austin slightly lowered his head, then sent a hand signal towards the subordinates at the back.

Soon, one soldier brought a tube about as thick as a forearm.

Austin received the tube and carefully opened the lid, then took out a long bundle of paper from its inside.

‘What the?’

‘What is it?’

Many retainers, including Bernard and Andre, tilted their heads with puzzled looks.

Crackle.

Following a soft gesture of the hand, the bundle of paper spread out on top of the table.

Suddenly, everyone’s eyes widely opened.

“Th, this is……?”

“Is this perhaps……?”

Andre and Bernard couldn’t easily continue their words and stuttered.

Austin cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

“Yes. It’s the Lancephil Fief’s map.”

The giant paper that spread on top of the table.

That was in fact a map that meticulously draw the Lancephil and the Tale Region.

It wasn’t even comparable to the maps possessed by the Palace Library, the duke houses, or large merchants.

‘I, I’ve never seen a map like this.’

That size and accuracy was truly incredible.

It was almost as if the sight of Lancephil Fief was spreading in front of their eyes.

Roan looked at the half-dazed retainers and spread his right index finger.

Ssk.

The index finger slowly moved above the map, then soon stopped above a valley located east of the Pavor Castle.

Arslan Valley.

With the tip of his index finger, Roan lightly tapped the Arslan Valley.

“The location of the first decisive battle is Arslan.”

It was a powerful voice.

Roan looked straight at the retainers’ eyes.

“We will annihilate the Owells Forces here.”

The Decisive Battle (3) End.

Chapter 177




T/n: The second chapter of the week.

A wind like march.

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s march north was without a pause.

At the state where Chase Legion and the Owells Forces’ main army had receded to the west, the Lancephil Fief’s south and east were no different than an ownerless mountain.

Roan was doing the blitzkrieg that Count Jonathan Chase and Viscount Kali Owells wished so much.

“We will let those who surrender live!”

“We will not forgive those who resist!”

The thousand-man ranked commanders shouted as they roamed the battlefield.

Each time, tens, hundreds of enemy soldiers who became afraid threw away their weapons and surrendered.

That was not all.

“My lord!”

Soldiers ran towards him from every direction.

“The Luton Castle at the east has requested their surrender!”

“The Halo Region at the southeast wishes to walk together with us, sir!”

The major base cities and the community leaders of the regions that originally followed Io Lancephil competed to surrender first.

Thanks to that, the castles and regions he gained without touching a single drop of blood on his hand gradually became more than the castles and regions he had conquered through battles.

Roan nodded his head with a satisfied expression, then looked at Semi.

“Semi.”

“Yes. My lord.”

“Go around the castles and regions that have newly surrendered and subjugate the remnants of the enemy forces.”

“Yes! Understood, sir!”

Semi answered in a loud voice, then led the Impasse, the troop under his command, and left towards the east.

Roan ordered without a rest.

“Pete!”

“Yes! My lord!”

The thousand-man commander Pete rode his horse and approached.

“Collect the bodies of the fallen and look after the injured.Send the soldiers whose injuries are serious back to the Mediasis Castle together with the corpses.”

“Understood, sir.”

Pete lowered his head and then returned to his position.

“Austin. Organize the newly surrendered soldiers into each legion. After taking some time to rest and organize, we will march towards the north.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Austin, who was staying nearby, began to busily move together with an answer.

Roan did not thoughtlessly waste time.

When a battle ended, he first collected the fallen and the injured, then directly went into preparing for the next battle.

Ggiiiik!

Above his head, about fifteen birds flew about.

Mostly, they were the spy birds and the messenger birds of the Agens and the Tenebra Troop.

Roan lightly glanced at them, then formed a peculiar smile.

‘It should now be about time they slowly begin to move.’

The board was set.

Now, it was the time for the dolls to dance on top of the board that was set.

Roan’s eyes flashed and shone a light.

*****

Boom!

Count Jonathan Chase couldn’t hold himself and kicked the table.

The drinks and the food that had been nicely set rolled on top of the ground.

Kali Owells, who was sitting on the opposite side tilting his wine cup, slightly creased his forehead and brushed off the food bits that rubbed on his sleeve.

“Hhm. I’m sorry about that.”

Jonathan lowered his rage a moment late and made a bitter smile.

Kali slightly lowered and showed his head as to mean it is okay.

The commander who raise the report just before, with a completely nervous expression, swallowed dry spit.

Jonathan asked with a completely creased face.

“So, five castles were conquered and three regions have went over already?”

“Yes. That is so, sir.”

The commander immediately nodded his head.

“And the reinforcement I sent two days ago was also destroyed?”

“Yes. That is so, sir.”

The commander could only nod his head.

It was because that was the truth.

“Kuuk.”

Jonathan clenched his teeth.

The rage pushed up once more.

His life until now was a leveled road.

There was nothing that did not go as he wished, and the ones who went against his will too did not existed.

Even the Rinse Kingdom’s throne succession competition, he was going back and forth between Tommy Rinse and Kallum Rinse, and was rubbing them under his thumb as befitting his taste.

But.

‘Just how dare an unknown and unheard of lowly thing pop out and muddle the waters!’

Since Roan had appeared, the story changed.

The steps that were without a pause was caught on a brake.

No, it wasn’t at a level of being caught on a brake.

This was honestly a level of being tripped and rolling down.

‘To think he would grow this much.’

If he knew he would be like this, he should have stomped him down when he was the Tale Region’s baron.

No, he should have stomped him when his henchman and the former Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander, Benjamin Doyle was disgraced.

Since Roan at the time was merely a troop commander of a commoner background.

‘Damn it. To think I have to be angered by a thing that doesn’t even have fundamentals……’ 1

His ego was badly hurt.

At that moment, Kali, who was quietly tilting his wine cup, spoke in a quiet voice.

“There is no need to worry so much, sir.”

He faintly smiled as he stood up from his seat.

“Looking at the situation going around, it seems that the Tale Legion isn’t on the western frontline, sir.”

“As expected, is it like that……”

Jonathan’s facial expression stiffly solidified.

At first, he was unsure.

It was because the battles were occurring on the western frontline even now.

This was that Brian Miles and the troop below him, who Roan had left while moving the Tale Legion to the southeast, were harassing the western frontline.

“I will lead a legion and head towards the east. Sir Count remain here and please subjugate the bastards’ remnants.”

“It will be inadequate with only the Owells Forces.”

It was a situation where the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Guardian Army had each combined their strengths.

A danger followed to face them alone.

At those words, Kali faintly smiled and shook his head.

“Please do not worry. I plan to fight together with Walter, who is on the northeastern frontline.”

He had no thought of stubbornly charging and attempting a grand reversal.

‘However much you bastard’s eyes and ears are bright, the Lancephil Fief is where I lived.’

He knew the fief’s topography and geography better than anyone.

Inside his head, schemes to destroy Roan, the Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion were full.

“It seems you have some sort of plan.”

Jonathan faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

However, he was a man whose pride was much stronger than Kali had thought.

“I will hand you two troops under the Chase Legion. Take them along and fight together. Roan, rip apart that bastard’s limbs.”

Jonathan did not want a simple revenge but a thorough revenge.

He planned to shred and rip Roan into pieces and throw him as feed for the pigs.

However, Kali did not in fact liked such generosity.

“If so, what should we do about the troops’ command, sir?”

It was because there was a gap that Jonathan’s henchmen might interfere in his command.

‘Look at this bastard……’

Jonathan looked at Kali, who slightly showed his intentions, and formed a chilly smile.

The look of him raising his head at him did not please his heart.

But now wasn’t the time to raise a confrontation between the allies.

He lightly nodded his head and waved his hand.

“Of course you should have the command.”

“Thank you for your consideration, sir.”

Kali quickly lowered his head.

Then holding the metal disk recognizing his command, he exited the tent.

As the situation was such, there was no reason to idle.

He soon called the Owells Forces and the Chase Legion’s troops that he had separately been assigned, and marched towards the east.

Demis Izy, who was one of the commanders, carefully approached.

“Where should we set as our destination, sir?”

He was asking of the battlefield.

Kali, with eyes that had sank low, looked towards the east.

“The location of the decisive battle……”

In his voice, a killing intent rubbed off.

“Is Arslan Valley.”

Expression full of confidence.

‘There is no place like that one.’

The Lancephil Fief’s geography was, without a single thing missing, within his head.

Amongst them, he chose the location that he could pull out the most perfect victory.

However, he did not quite knew.

That this decision, which he thought of as very ideal and excellent decision, was in truth completely grasped by someone else.

However much he ran, he was unable to escape from the palm.

*****

Arslan Valley.

A valley located at the Lancephil Fief’s East, it was famous for being highly precipitous compared to its small size.

Furthermore, because its shape too was not ordinary, there was a wide and long space between the perilous cliffsides that rose to both sides that two thousand men could move through at once.

Forests were overgrown on both sides’ exits, and after getting out of the forest, regions of low hills were widely spread out.

Before Io led the fief regiment and subjugate the place, it was the main stronghold of the Arslan Brigand and various monsters’ dens were located.

“The scenery truly is nice.”

Roan sat on top of a warhorse and looked at the Arslan Valley that roughly took place.

At that moment, Austin, who was nearby, asked in a small voice.

“My lord. Should we do something?”

Roan slightly nodded his head, then lightly raised his left and gave a hand signal.

Soon, the sound of horns and gongs noisily rang.

Vvuuuuuu! Jing! Jing! Jing!

Suddenly, the Tale Legion’s soldiers and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers, who were chasing the enemy forces, slowly lowered their speed.

“Pull back again?”

“We’re stopping the chase?”

“Even though it really was right before planting a sword at the back of their heads?”

The minor soldiers smacked their lips as if regrettable.

Compared to them, the commanders above hundred-man rank quickly reacted to Roan’s order.

Soon, they reorganized the troop and began to quickly retreat.

In an instant, the entire legion moved back all the way to the back of the hills.

After looking at that sight, Austin spoke in a small voice.

“We have arrived at the Arslan Valley, sir.”

Roan faintly smiled at those words and asked back.

“How was it while we came here?”

Austin answered without hesitation.

“The Owells Forces bastards were idiots.”

Roan did not say any words and awaited his remaining words.

A smile hung around Austin’s mouth.

“They were too openly luring us towards the Arslan Valley, sir.”

Roan slowly nodded his head at those words.

It was as according to Austin’s words.

Every time the Owells Forces bastards fought, they were much too easily destroyed and ran.

The problem was that the retreat path was much too noticeably towards the Arslan Valley.

Roan looked at the steep Arslan Valley and deeply breathed in.

“This time as well, I’m greatly awed by Clay.”

“I’m also the same, sir.”

As soon as his words finished, Austin echoed.

The one who chose the location of the first decisive battle as the Arslan Valley was Clay.

No, to be exact, he had predicted that the location of the decisive battle would be the Arslan Valley.

Clay had opined that if it was Kali, who was versed in the Lancephil Fief, he would choose the Arslan Valley as the place of counterattack.

‘Furthermore, he guaranteed that Kali, rather than Count Chase, would step up if we were to achieve continuous victories.’

Even while staying in the Mediasis Castle far away from the battlefields, his eye of reading the war’s situation was greatly precise.

He truly was an outstanding genius.

But.

‘The thing he is more amazing is……’

The light in Roan’s eyes deeply sank.

‘That he even knew the truth that I gave a secret order to Walter.’

Using that, Clay had even set up a meticulous plan to how to lead the Arslan Valley’s decisive battle.

‘Although he says that he have inferred it from me and Walter’s relation, the process and time of Walter’s betrayal, Walter’s battles, and so on, but……’

He couldn’t plainly believe that.

The smile that floated up around Roan’s mouth disappeared.

His gaze headed towards the reconnaissance birds and the messenger birds flying above his head.

‘Clay. Are you not spying on me?’

It was an obvious suspicion.

Abruptly, the words Princess Aily Rinse said in the past floated up once again.

‘Certainly, she said not to give him all of my trust. That Clay’s heart couldn’t be seen……’

Roan spat out a long sigh.

Whether the reason he spied on him was of a good intention or a bad intention, that was not important.

The fact that he was spying and watching him itself was important.

‘I should have a talk with him once the fief war is finished.’

He laboriously threw away the complicated thoughts inside his head.

Right now was the time to focus on the first decisive battle that would spread in front of him.

“Austin.”

“Yes! Please speak, sir.”

Austin answered with an expression completely filled with strength.

Roan, in a small and quiet voice, ordered.

“Divide the Tale Legion into two. You lead one half and set up a formation inside the forest. And……”

His voice became much quieter.

A moment later.

“Ah……”

Austin, with a half dazed expression, burst out an exclamation.

“Just when did you prepare all the way to that point, sir?”

At the board that was finely set even without him knowing, he repeated his awe.

Roan faintly smiled and quietly nodded his head.

Austin then saluted.

“Sir! I will definitely execute the mission, sir.”

He quickly led his horse and disappeared.

Baron Bernard Landingham and Baron Andre Molde, who were nearby, asked in a cautious voice.

“What do you plan to do from now on, sir?”

They hadn’t heard the secret mission that Roan had granted to Austin.

Because of that, their faces were full of puzzlement.

‘I can understand up to choosing Arslan, which is a precipitous valley, as the location of the decisive battle. But……’

He couldn’t know what kind of unusual schemes Roan had after this.

Roan faintly smiled and answered shortly.

“We will lead the entire force and pierce through the Arslan Valley.”

The instant his words finished, Bernard and Andre creased their brows.

“Eh? Pierce through? Although the valley’s gap is wide, forests are spread out on the side of the entrance and the exit. If the enemy were waiting in ambush or so, we will receive large damage.”

“No, more than that, we could receive a flame attack after entering the forest. If so, the entire legion will be exterminated.”

At those words, Roan quietly smiled, then slightly raised his head and looked at the sky.

A clear and bright sky.

It was a sky without a hint of cloud.

At that moment, a spirit tinted with a red light appeared in front of his eyes.

It was Kinis.

Roan faintly smiled and threw a question through his head.

‘Kinis. You’re certain that rain would come, right?’

Kinis, with a self-confident expression, answered.

[Don’t worry. Since although I can’t make it rain yet, I can at least ridiculously predict the weather.]

She looked up at the sky following Roan, then spoke in a sharp voice.

[Rain will definitely come. Definitely.]

Roan quietly nodded his head as he looked up at the sky.

Bernard and Andre, who were watching the situation with worried expression, followed Roan and looked at the sky.

‘Is there something?’

‘What is he looking at?’

But the only thing that was seen was a clear sky.

At that moment, Roan’s voice was heard.

“All of you, don’t worry.”

A soft spirit flowed.

Bernard and Andre turned their heads and looked at Roan.

Cheerfully smiling, Roan added on.

“Since the heaven will help us.”

To Bernard and Andre, whose piety weren’t deep, it wasn’t quite a trustworthy sentence.

They merely smiled bitterly and nodded their heads.

At that moment, Kinis’ voice was heard at the edge of Roan’s ears.

[Hmph! Getting all on a high horse! They’re all what I’ve told you!]

The Decisive Battle (4) End.

so… “thing” here refers to Roan, which was the most downgrading thing I could think of. Also, the word for “Fundamentals” here is 근본, which literally means roots or essence. In this context, for example, it most likely means “essence/fundamentals of a noble”. ↩

Chapter 178




“Until now is as expected, sir.”

“Good.”

At the adjutant’s report, Kali Owells formed a satisfied expression.

His gaze headed beyond the hills.

A widely spread forest, and a steep mountain that abruptly rose beyond it.

It was the Arslan Valley.

‘Roan bastard has arrived at the other side of the valley, and……’

If only his son Walter Owells and the troop under him took position, all preparation would be finished.

‘Walter. What are you doing, now isn’t the time to dawdle.’

A cold light flowed around his eyes.

At that moment.

“Sir Viscount!”

Together with a bright voice, Demis Izy showed his appearance.

He pointlessly looked around the inside of the tent once, then took out a single page letter from his chest pocket.

“It’s the letter Sir Walter sent.”

“Hhm.”

With a short groan, Kali snatched the letter.

The letter’s content was short and simple.

However, it was enough to make Kali’s heart satisfied.

“Good. The things are resolving well.”

The other commanders inside the tent asked in careful voices.

“Is it the news we desired, sir?”

“Has he arrived?”

At those words, Kali faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Yes. He says that he has took a position at Roan bastard’s rear.”

As soon as his words finished, many commanders tightly clenched their fists.

At last, the perfect trap had been set.

Kali moved his feet and stood in front of a table.

On the table, a map almost incomparably shoddy to Roan’s was spread out.

Kali’s finger busily moved.

“Look well. We are currently positioned on the hills west of the Arslan Valley. Roan bastard is positioned on the opposite hills at east. And Walter is approaching that very behind.”

Because the hills were so widely spread out, Roan finding Walter wasn’t an easy task.

At least, Kali and his adjutants thought so.

Kali pointed at the wide and long space that penetrated through the Arslan Valley.

“We will lure Roan bastard inside this valley.”

Like until now, he planned to use the mean of using a small-scale troop to create a battle and then retreating.

Either way, Roan didn’t knew that Kali and the Owells Forces’ main army had came here. No, he couldn’t know.

Of course, this too was Kali and his adjutants’ thought.

“After the bastards enter the valley chasing our allies and charge into the western side forests, we will lit a fire.”

The commanders all nodded their heads.

Thanks to the warm and dry spring weather having continued, the forests were in a completely dry state.

It was a state where one could burn out the entire forest with merely a single ember.

Kali’s words continued on.

“At the same time, Walter will charge and also set fire to the eastern side forests.”

If it only became as the plan, Roan, the Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion will be trapped inside a pit of fire.

“The Owells Forces’ main army and the Walter Troop will surround both sides’ forests and slaughter Roan and the enemy who run out.”

This was the first plan Kali had raised.

At that moment, Demis, who was staying silent, pointed at Arslan Valley’s two mountains.

“Sir, are we not placing an ambush at the two mountains’ summits?”

At those words, Kali quickly shook his head.

“The mountain is too precipitous so there is no big merit to it.”

There was no space for enough number of soldiers to inflict a damage to the enemy.

Furthermore, even if they were to take position, they couldn’t gather things like trees or stones they could throw towards the bottom.

Demis soon nodded his head and stepped back.

If Kali said so, it was so.

There was no one who know the Lancpehil Region as much as Kali.

Faint anticipation floated up on everyone’s faces.

‘If it goes just like this, it’ll be a giant victory.’

‘We could give a large blow to the enemy’s main army.’

A complete victory enough to seize the chance of victory of the fief war.

At that moment, one of the commanders hesitated, then cautiously opened his mouth.

“But……”

Suddenly, every commanders’ eyes headed towards the young commander.

He looked around the gazes pouring onto himself, then added on in a small voice.

“What will we do if a rain perhaps comes, sir?”

Then, the fire attack that they laboriously prepared would become a bubble.

The jubilant mood cooled in an instant.

It was a situation where he had spoiled the battle even before it even began.

In place of everyone, Demis glared with his eyes.

“Don’t say something so ominous! Don’t you know the Lancephil Fief’s spring weather! Rain basically doesn’t come in this season!”

“Right. It’s the season when people emphasize to always be careful of fire.”

“It’s also the season when people suffer from drought.”

From everywhere, statements denouncing him poured down.

The young commander who spoke up bitterly smiled and nodded his head.

Then he slightly stepped back and lowered his head.

A completely intimidated look.

Kali quietly looked at that sight, then snickered out a laugh.

“There will be no event of rain coming.”

It was a voice full of certainty.

His eyes flashed and shined a light.

‘As long as the heaven does not forsaken me……’

*****

“Is that true, sir?”

Baron Bernard Landingham raised his head and looked up at the sky.

It was a sky without a single speck of cloud.

He, with a puzzled look, murmured.

“The rain really is coming, is it sir?”

“That is right. He definitely said so. Isn’t that right, my lord?”

The one who asked following his addendum was Harrison.

Roan, who was looking over the camp’s inside, subtly looked up at the sky.

As much as Bernard as well as numerous commanders would worry, the weather was simply too good.

[Eh?! Roan. Your eyes just now shook a little, no? Right? Un? Did you slightly doubt me just now?]

Suddenly, Kinis’ sharp voice was heard from the edge of his ears.

Roan inwardly made a smile.

It was because his heart was seen.

Even so, he feigned ignorance.

‘What do you mean? I never doubted you.’

Then as if to show her, he looked at the many commanders including Bernard and Harrison.

“The rain will absolutely come.”

A voice full of certainty.

A resolute expression.

At those words, Bernard slightly nodded his head and then looked at the sky again.

“If rain really comes……”

The end of his voice slightly shook.

“The heaven should be on our side.”

Numerous people nodded their heads.

At that moment.

Yoo. 1

A soft wind blowed below his ear.

The wind slowly showed a rough temperance.

Flap.

The flag planted at the center of the tent shook its body slightly.

“Un?”

The commanders as well as the soldiers inside the camp all startled and looked around themselves.

Now, the wind violently blew enough to shake their hair.

Furthermore.

“What kind of wind is so humid?”

Baron Andre Molde thoughtlessly murmured, then soon widely opened his eyes.

Suddenly, as if everyone had promised, they raised their heads and looked up at the sky.

It was no more.

The sky shining with a blue light was no more.

It was there.

A grey-lighted cloud that not a single speck they could see before.

And.

Plip.

One drop of water fell on top of their cheek.

“Eh?”

“What the?”

The commanders and the soldiers lightly wiped their cheeks and looked at Roan.

Expression that said they couldn’t believe it.

On the other hand, Roan formed a faint smile with a composed expression.

He slowly raised his head and looked up at the sky.

Thanks to the Kalian’s Tears, the falling raindrops were seen clearly.

“The sky……”

Roan’s voice spread throughout the camp’s inside.

Everyone’s gazes headed towards Roan.

The smile hanging around his mouth became much thicker.

“Is on our side.”

A silence fell.

All stared at Roan with expressions mixed with awe.

With a calm expression, Roan quietly closed his eyes.

It wasn’t to enjoy the rain falling down.

[Getting on a high horse! You know this is all thanks to me, right?]

It was because of Kinis’ sharp nagging.

To Roan, silence wasn’t silence.

But today, Kinis’ nagging and whining was truly nice to hear.

‘I should now slowly move.’

The blood within his body hotly boiled up.

*****

Plip. Plopplopplopplopplop.

The raindrops that had been falling in one and two drops soon became a thick stream of rain.

A sweet spring rain that wetted the arid land.

But Kali’s expression, who was staring at the spring rain, was frozen stiffly.

‘Is the heaven truly throwing me away?’

The young commander that blabbered as if to spoil the things in the last military meeting floated up in his head.

Uddk.

The teeth naturally grinded.

‘No. The heaven has not given me up!’

He didn’t want to believe so.

With a hand gesture, he beckoned Demis.

“Bring me the commander from before who flippantly spread his mouth.”

“Ah…… yes. Understood, sir.”

Demis instantly realized Kali’s intention.

Even without that, currently, ominous sounds saying sky was whatnot, god was whatnot was floating around between several commanders.

Soon, Demis dragged over the young commander who had carelessly opened his mouth.

“Sir Izy! Why are you suddenly doing this?”

As if he had been dragged there without even knowing why, a panicked expression was clear on the commander’s face.

Because of the rain that powerfully fell, it wasn’t even easy to open one’s eyes.

Sslng.

Kali stepped towards the bastard as he pulled out his sword.

‘It’s because of this bastard carelessly flapping his mouth.’

It absolutely wasn’t that the heaven had thrown him away.

He wished to believe so.

Because of that, he could only pull out his sword.

“Eh? Eh?! Si, Sir Owells! Wha, why are you doing…… Kkeurrg.”

The young commander waved his arms and flustered about.

But without even quite finishing the words he spat out, he goggled his eyes.

Kali’s sword cut his head.

With a sound of blood boiling, the head rolled on the ground.

“It’s the price of carelessly flapping your mouth.”

With his left foot, Kali kicked away the commander’s head.

The violent streaks of rain washed off the blood rubbed on the blade.

Gulp.

The nearby commanders gulped with nervous expressions.

Kali looked at them with a fierce light in his eyes and shouted.

“All of you, there is no need to panic! There is nothing that changes even if the rain comes! If we surround the forests and do an ambush attack, we can massacre the enemy army even with a smaller number! Even if the valley’s space is wide, they will inescapably be annihilated if they wish to escape that……”

When his words reached about that point.

Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!

The sound of bell noisily rang.

Simultaneously, one lookout soldier ran towards him.

“I, it’s the flag signal! The enemy has marched! The enemy has entered into the Arslan Valley, sir!”

A resounding voice shook apart the camp’s inside.

“What?!”

“The Tale Legion has?!”

“You say Roan has marched?!”

The commanders shouted with surprised expressions.

For the bastards who hadn’t move despite the baiting operation that they had tirelessly attempted for two days to do an abrupt march.

Everyone’s gazes turned towards Kali.

Kali, with his eyes closed, breathed in deeply.

Plopplopplopplopplop.

Only the sound of rain was violently heard.

“Sir Owells. The time is……”

Demis whispered with an urgent voice.

Kali finally opened his eyes and raised high the sword that had cut the young commander’s neck.

“All forces march! We will surround the forests, then corner the bastards!”

The order was given.

“March! Prepare to march!”

“We will surround the forests!”

The commanders shouted in loud voices and busily moved.

Instantly, the preparation for interception was finished.

Kali went up onto a warhorse and separately called a commander.

“Send the flag signal to Walter.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

The commander answered shortly, then ran towards a watchtower.

Kali watched that sight for a moment, then led his horse and headed towards the camp’s entrance.

Already, everyone had perfectly gotten the preparation to march.

“All forces march!”

Kali did not hesitate.

He spurred his horse and charged towards the Arsland Valley.

Dudududududu! Plopplopplopplopplop

The sound of horse hooves and raindrops noisily rang.

Although the streaks of rain hit their faces, not a single one faltered.

They pierced through the rain and charged.

Thanks to that, the Owells Forces were able to arrive at the forests before Roan, Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion broke out of the Arslan Valley.

“Blockade! Archer Troop ready!”

“Blockade! Archer Troop ready!”

The same orders spread out to the left and right.

Ggigigigigik!

The sounds of pulling the bowstrings noisily rang.

Soon, the sound of horse hooves were quietly heard.

It was definite that it was the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion.

Kali quickly raised his left hand high and gulped a dry spit.

The eyes were piercing through the streaks of rain and glaring at the dark inside of the forest.

Vvuuuu! Vvuuuuuu!

Together a sound of horn, a noisy sound was heard from the inside of the forest.

“Fire!”

Kali, as if to say that he had been waiting, lowered his arm with a sonorous voice.

Soon, hundreds of arrows cut through the air and flew towards the inside of the forest.

Pubububububuk!

Few were planted on the trees and few shook through the air.

“Uaaaak!”

“Aak!”

“Kuuk!”

Sound of screams were faintly heard.

Jing! Jing! Jing! Boom! Boom! Boom!

From inside the forest, sounds of gong and drum flowed out.

‘It’s done!’

Kali’s face flashed with ecstasy.

He certained that Roan and the soldiers of the bastard’s legion had fallen into chaos.

“Fire! Pour down the arrows!”

Kali continued to shout.

In truth, firing arrows towards a forest wasn’t quite a good tactic.

It was because the dense trees acted the role of shields.

But for now, it could plentily do the role of snapping the enemy army’s spirit and vanguard.

“Sir Owells!”

“Sir Owells!”

The commanders who were spread to the left and right called Kali as they raised their right hands.

It meant that the archer troop’s attack was nearing its end.

Kali, with his sword pulled out, took a step forwards.

“Cavalry troop and infantry troop, deploy!”

“Deploy!”

They couldn’t hesitate any longer.

If they snapped their spirit and vanguard, they had to corner the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers so that they couldn’t come out of the valley.

‘It’s enough even if it isn’t a fire attack.’

Because the valley’s entrance was small, they could plentily face the bastards even with a small number of soldiers.

Furthermore, they should not know of the existence of Owells Force’s main army.

In Roan’s position, it was the same as having taken an ambush and a raid attack.

It was obvious that they would fall into chaos and fluster.

Of course, this also was only Kali’s thought.

“Waaaaah!”

“Kill them!”

“Cut Roan’s neck!”

Together with a cheer, the Owells Forces’ soldiers charged into the forests.

On the trees and the ground, arrows were tightly planted.

Once they entered a bit further, shields and soldiers planted with arrows were spread around.

They were the Tale Legion’s soldiers and the small-scale shield, parma, that they favored.

“Alright!”

“Serves you right!”

Delighted, the Owells Forces’ soldiers spat out spits or kicked.

Pulling up their spirits even more, they charged into the deep area of the forests.

Their looks were all of one anticipating a grand victory.

Amongst that, only Demis creased his brows at the strange mood.

‘Aren’t the corpses too few?’

It was an ambush attack.

However much the densely packed trees acted as shields, the number of soldiers who were done in by the arrow attacks were too few.

As if.

‘A look of having moved while preparing?’

A frightening feeling whirled around his entire body.

He led his horse to quickly report to Kali.

Startle.

But soon he pulled his rein.

‘No, If I needlessly speak wrong again……’

He didn’t know whether he would become the same sight as the young commander whose head had flown off just before.

He needlessly rubbed his own neck and shook his head.

He had given up remonstrating.

Instead, Demis sent a secret order to his own troop to slow their charge, then subtly moved back to the rear.

It was in order to save at least his own life even if the feared situation happened.

Regrettably, there was no one who noticed Demis’ such action.

The Owells Forces including Kali would merely charge, and charge again.

And finally.

“It’s the enemy army!”

“It’s the enemy army!”

The same words with each holding different meaning echoed through the forests.

The Owells Forces that had been charging, the Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion had finally met.

“Kill them!”

“Corner them!”

Kali shouted at the top of his lungs and swung his sword.

‘As expected, the number of soldiers isn’t a lot!’

It was likely because of the Arslan Valley’s entrance.

He turned his head this way and that and searched for Roan.

Soon, Kali’s gaze followed towards the inside of the forest.

‘Roan. So you were there.’

Uddk.

His teeth naturally gritted.

The burning gaze continued to the other size.

“Huu. The hostility is incredible.”

A composed voice.

Through the Kalian’s Tears, Roan was staring straight at Kali’s eyes that were glaring at him.

If possible, he wanted to immediately rush over and have a decisive duel, but now wasn’t the time to do so.

For the complete victory, there was a need to pull the enemy army until a place a bit more deeper.

“We will fight adequately then retreat.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Bernard, Andre, and the others answered shortly, then spread out in every direction.

There no longer were doubts left on their faces.

It was because they had heard the entirety of this decisive battle from Roan right before charging into the Arslan Valley.

Roan looked at the scattering commanders and breathed in deeply.

‘Kali Owells.’

A faint smile hung on his mouth.

‘You are already snared in a trap. And……’

A cold light flowed around his eyes.

‘On the trap you bastard has set at that.’

The biggest battle after this fief war had began.

It was the beginning of the decisive battle that would later be called the Arslan battle.

The Decisive Battle (5) End.

Chapter 179




A battle within a rain.

A bloody fight in a middle of rain.

Within the rain that violently fell, screams and shouts became disjointed.

“Die!”

“Uaaah!”

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Following that, sound of metal hit the ears.

A struggle in order to kill each other.

Eyes filled with madness licked each other’s body.

Suddenly.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

Sound of a bell noisily rang.

The commanders of the Tale Legion and the Lancephli Legion, who were encouraging the soldiers and fighting at the front, pulled back their reins.

“Retreat!”

“Retreat!”

“Damn it! We are moving back and reorganizing the formation!”

Voices that truly seemed to be urgent.

Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers moved without a single disorder.

They, seeing the sound of gong, orders, and repeating hand signals, quickly moved back.

“Uhahahaha!”

“The enemy are running away!”

“Chase them! Catch Roan!”

The Owells Forces were seized by madness.

They obstinately chased the backs of the Tale legion and the Lancephil Legion that were retreating.

At that moment, Roan, who was watching the situation, kicked his horse while slantly holding his spear.

“Taemusas!”

A thunder-like voice pierced through the rain and rang.

“Yes sir!”

Together with sonorous voices, each troop’s Taemusas, who were each scattered and moving, swarmed up.

Crimson armor.

A crimson wave stormed.

The sight of them going against the retreating ally soldiers and charging.

That almost brought to mind the salmons going against a violent stream.

‘Kinis. The entire world is completely full of water energy.’

The streaks of rain violently fell.

Kinis fully inhaled and made a bright smile.

[My entire body is overflowing with energy!]

At those words, Roan, not through the Flamdor Mana Technique but the Tale Mana Technique, pulled up the water energy inside his body.

‘That overflowing energy, pour it out to your heart’s content for today.’

[Un!]

A short and clear answer.

As if to flap wings, Kinis shook her shoulders and headed towards the Owells Forces.

Her hands dizzily moved.

Suddenly, clumps of water the size of a child’s head flew towards the soldiers.

“Wha, what the!”

“What is this?”

Owells Forces’ soldiers, looking at the clumps of water that suddenly appeared, creased their foreheads.

Amongst them, few raised their swords and tried to cut apart the clumps of water.

But soon, they realized how dumb and foolish thought it was.

Pubuk! Pububuk!

The power that was carried in the water clumps was enormous.

That wasn’t merely a clump of water.

To be precise, it was alike the aque ball amongst the attack magics.

[Hmph! You brats think you can stop this?]

Kinis flew around and over the soldiers’ heads and kept firing out the clumps of water.

“Kuk!”

“Kuhuk!”

Each time, the Owells Forces’ soldiers were knocked out in ones and twos.

Of course, the water energy inside Roan’s body too went out bit by bit.

But because everywhere was so full of water energy, it didn’t become a large stress.

“Spread out!”

A new order.

Following Roan’s shout, the Taemusas extended longly and blocked the Owells Forces.

“You insane bastards!”

“Are you saying you’ll stop us with merely that that much of a number!”

Even the rearguards had its own standards.

The Owells Forces’ knights snorted as they stepped forwards.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

With metallic sounds, the two side’s elite soldiers collided.

Although the Owells Forces’ knights were more excellent when looking only at individuals’ strengths, Roan’s Taemusas had group battle ability that was peerless.

Furthermore, their number too was greater than the Owells Forces’ knights.

And most of all.

Boom!

With a sound of explosion, the Owells Forces’ soldiers were flung away.

To the Taemusas, a fearsome god of war existed.

“Gurruk.”

“Kuhuk.”

The Owells Force’s soldiers, with sound of blood boiling, dropped their heads.

All alike one, their arms and legs were cut off or their chests were longly cut.

Plopplopplopplop.

Above that, a stream of water thicker than the streaks of rain fell down.

A single warhorse moved its steps between the corpses strewn about.

Splash. Splash.

Each time, rainwater and blood splashed up following the horse hooves.

Chaaaaah.

Following the long spear, a stream of water extended like a spearhead.

The one sitting on the warhorse and looking down on the battlefield was Roan.

He, with the Travias Spear, pointed at the Owells Forces’ knights.

Unlike the usual, and rather than a flame, a stream of water soared on the spearhead.

Not only that, a stream of water about two fingers thick whirled as if to protect Roan’s body.

A sight as if droopingly wearing a long ribbon made of water.

“N, not a crimson ghost but……”

“A blue ghost?”

Few knights murmured with dazed expressions.

At that moment, Roan’s spear cut through the space.

Following the trajectory, the stream of water and rain swerved and shook.

Paat!

The stream of water that was coating the spearhead flew out long in a shape of a crescent.

“Kuk!”

“Block it!”

Two knights extended their swords forwards.

But like a flowing river, the stream of water softly brushed and passed their swords.

“Eh?”

“Hph!”

They tried to dodge a moment later, but it was already too late.

Ssskuk!

With a horrifying sound, the two knight’s heads fell onto the ground.

“No way……”

“He’s that strong?”

The Owells Forces’ knights and soldiers who had for the first time personally seen Roan’s might became dazed.

On the other hand, the Taemusas paid no mind and devoted to their own mission.

Ssskuk! Sssguk! Chaack!

Roaming through between the enemies, they tirelessly swung their weapons.

Word for word, it seemed like a crimson wave rolling.

“Uuuuh.”

“They’re monsters. Monsters.”

The Owells Forces felt a fear as if blood rising up until below their chins.

Definitely until just now, their spirits were high as to pierce the sky and the state of the battle was still more advantageous to them.

In numbers or formation, there was no reason for them to falter.

Only one thing.

Roan’s existence made their feet slow.

At that moment.

“Roan!!!”

From the sunken Owells Forces’ formation, a thunderous roar exploded out.

Dudududu.

The man piercing and rushing through the violent rain.

He was the ringleader of this fief war and the traitor of the era, Kali Owells.

Kicking the horse’s stomach, he widely swung a brilliant longsword.

Chang!

A spark flew from the powerful strike.

‘He is certainly different.’

At the powerful strength felt throughout his entire palm, Roan made a bitter smile.

Kali was different than the other knights.

He knew how to properly use mana and his physical abilities were also outstanding.

Furthermore.

“Si, Sir Viscount is fighting!”

“He’s pushing away that ghost!”

Beyond ambition and black heart, Kali himself was definitely an outstanding warrior.

When he stepped forwards, the Owells Forces’ spirit that was snapped a degree revived once again.

As the ones who were at an advantage in numbers reorganized their formations and went on to counterattack, the Taemusas began to be slowly pushed back.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Even while exchanging attacks with Kali, Roan did not miss the situation of the war that was flowing.

‘It’s until this point.’

Any further battle was meaningless.

The retreating main army had also escaped the forest and had entered the Arslan Valley.

“Kali.”

Roan lightly parried away Kali’s sword and then formed a faint smile.

Kali thought that was mocking him.

“I will absolutely cut you bastard’s neck today.”

He pulled the mana inside his body and violently shook his sword.

Roan lightly bent his body and dodged the attack.

Sswung!

A fierce sound of cutting through the air hit the ears.

“For cutting my neck……”

Roan quickly twisted his wrist and thrusted his spear.

Following the spearhead, a stream of water shot out.

“Kuk!”

Kali quickly swung his sword roundly and blocked Roan’s attack.

At that moment, Roan’s voice fierced through his ears.

“That is an unsightly skill.”

“What?”

Kali’s expression twisted.

When he deflected away the stream of water and looked, Roan’s sight wasn’t seen.

No, far away, the sight of his back running towards the Arslan Valley was seen.

“Are you running away!”

Kali shouted with a brightly flushed face.

Roan lightly looked back and answered in a soft voice.

“I do not harass the weak.”

At that moment.

[I can fight more! I’m overflowing with power!]

Kinis’ grumble-mixed voice was heard.

Roan diligently ignored her and, with a resounding voice, gave a new order.

“Retreat!”

Finally, the retreat order was given.

The Taemusas, who even without that were slowly being pushed back, sprinted towards the valley as if they had been waiting.

The role of the rearguard was already perfectly executed.

On the faces with tired looks clear, satisfied smiles were hung.

Uddk.

Watching the sight of Roan and the Taemusas getting further away, Kali grinded his teeth.

‘Hmph! To dare show your back in front of me!”

He quickly raised his sword up high.

“Chase them! Pack the bastards into the valley’s inside!”

The instant the order had fell, the entire Owells Forces charged towards the Arslan Valley.

Dududududu!

Sound ringing the ground.

Although they had missed Roan and the Taemusas, undisguisable ecstasy floated up on Kali and the commanders’ faces.

‘Roan. He probably thinks that he has safely escaped, right?’

‘Kukuku. Idiotic things. In front of there, Sir Walter is waiting in ambush!’

‘We’ll drum you mindless from the front and back!’

They thoroughly trusted Walter Owells.

Thousands of Owells Forces quickly passed through the Arslan Valley and entered the forests spread out outside the eastern entrance.

As they had expected, the forests were extremely noisy.

“Uak!”

“Kuuk!”

“Save me!”

Sound of screams were noisy from everywhere.

Not only that.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Together with metallic sound.

Pubuk! Pububuk!

Sound of arrows being planted.

Vvuuuu! Deng! Deng! Deng!

Sounds of horn and bell and so on all noisily rang.

“It’s done! Walter has properly done it for us!”

Kali shouted with a voice elated to utmost.

“Attack! Attack! Join up and annihilate the enemy forces!”

“Attack! Attack!”

The Owells Forces’ commanders pulled out their weapons and entered into the forests.

Inside the forests, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion that were busily moving were seen.

Their expressions were extremely panicked.

Looking at that sight, Kali formed a frightening smile.

‘Walter. Splendid. Truly splendid.’

For the first time, his son Walter fitted right in his heart.

Thanks to his son, he had came to be able to catch Roan who was like a needle in his eye.

His chest floated up with pride.

At that moment beyond the streaks of rain, from a deep place in the forest, a troop that highly raised Owells Forces’ flag showed up.

It would definitely be Walter’s troop.

Without even knowing himself, Kali raised his sword up high.

But soon, he ended up creasing his brows.

‘What is that?’

At the place his gaze headed.

The left forearm of the breastplate that Owells House’s crest was engraved.

‘Why have you tied a blue cloth?’

An expression that said that he simply couldn’t understand.

The chest that had floated up with pride coldly sank down.

An unintelligible anxiety wrapped around his entire body.

Gulp.

Kali’s throat roughly moved.

Even though the rain was still violently falling, his lips tightly dried out.

*****

“Sir Owells. Is this direction really right, sir?”

Owells Forces’ troop commander Roberi tilted his head.

He couldn’t understand the marching direction.

At that moment, the young man who was going ahead pulled his rein and looked back at Roberi

“Roberi. You truly have a lot of suspicion.”

“Eh? N, no it’s not that, but……”

At the young man’s censure, Roberi waves his hands as if flustered.

The young man coldly smiled and added on.

“I have received my father, Viscount Kali Owell’s order and have merely came to the Arslan Valley’s west.”

The young man, he was in fact Walter Owells.

Currently, he was leading the Owells Forces that were left on the northeastern frontline, now the Walter Troop, and was moving towards the Arslan Valley’s western forests.

Roberi awkwardly smiled and lowered his head.

“I’m sorry if I had offended you, sir. I merely wondered, considering various things, that wouldn’t the Arslan Valley’s eastern forests than the western forest would be more proper……”

“We will merely follow the order.”

Walter, with a firm tone, shook his head.

Roberi once again lowered his head.

“Yes. That is right, sir. Since the superior’s orders are absolute. Especially if it’s a state when we’re facing a decisive battle like this before us, we need to follow much……”

“If you know so well, then do not do any more disrespectful acts.”

Walter once again spoke flat, then spurred his horse.

The Arslan Valley was in fact right in front of their noses.

‘Roberi. You are quite proficient.’

He brushed down his shocked heart.

Like Roberi’s words, Kali’s original order was to hide in ambush at Arslan Valley’s eastern forests.

The most important of important duties.

‘It means that he trusts me that much.’

Until now, he had countlessly stacked big and small military achievements in order to earn Kali’s trust.

Thanks to that, he had received an important mission in the battle large enough to decide the state of this fief war.

‘Everything is all according to Sir Count Roan Lancephil and my will.’

Finally, the golden opportunity to completely annihilate the Owells Forces had came.

Walter ignored Kali’s order and headed towards the Arslan Valley’s west following Roan’s will.

Furthermore.

‘This blue cloth.’

He looked down at the blue cloth he had wrapped on his left arm and made a faint smile.

It wasn’t only Walter who had wrapped a blue cloth.

The entire Walter troop including Walter, without a single one missing, was wearing the blue cloth.

‘To think he didn’t miss even the small part like this……’

He newly awed and awed again at Roan’s ability.

At that moment.

‘Hm?’

From the edge of his ear, a very small and weak sound of yelling was heard.

“Sir Owells!”

Roberi approached with an urgent expression.

Walter quickly nodded his head.

“However I think of it, it seems that the battle had already been created. We will have to run over immediately and help our allies.”

“Yes, sir. Understood. I will have all troop get ready for battle.”

Roberi immediately nodded his head, then tried to step back.

At that moment, Walter waved his hand and pointed at the left arm’s blue cloth.

“I’ll say it again, but the ones wearing this blue cloth are allies.”

“I know, sir. You said that fox-like bastard Roan may use again the remnant soldier disguise trick used to annihilate the Hadding Legion before, yes sir? I have clearly told every soldier, sir.”

A confident voice.

Walter lightly nodded his head.

With a short sigh, he stared at the Arslan Valley.

‘Make the enemies and the enemies fight each other.’

To Walter, who still didn’t have his own whole faction, it was a helpless choice.

And this too was a scheme that Roan had proposed.

Abruptly, Walter became curious.

‘Sir Count Lancephil hadn’t possibly seen through all the way here and used the remnant soldier disguise trick to annihilate the Hadding Legion, right?’

He couldn’t know.

But because that trick was there, even at Walter’s current order to wear a blue cloth, the commanders including Roberi and the soldiers did not held any doubt.

Walter’s eyes heavily sank.

‘Father.’

Kali’s face floated up in front of his eyes.

‘If we were like normal father and son, what kind of decision would I have made?’

There wasn’t even anyone to ask, nor was there anyone to answer either.

Walter tightly clenched his teeth and spurred his horse.

The streaks of rain hit his face.

Following his cheek, something that couldn’t be tell whether it was tears or rain sorrowfully rolled down.

The Decisive Battle (6) End.

Chapter 180




The Owells Forces violently pushed the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion.

“Hahaha! You bastards! Look over here as well!”

“Do you plan to keep showing us the back of your head like that!”

“Hahaha! Serves you right!”

They thought that Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion were overwhelmed facing the Walter Troop.

They certained that everything was flowing as they desired, as their plan.

But at that moment.

Clank!

Suddenly with a sound of armors clapping against each other, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers, who were facing the east, turned towards the west.

“Eh?”

The expressions of Owells Forces’ soldiers, at the abrupt situation, were slightly taken back.

But soon, they shouted with sneers.

“Hmph! Does our side look easier?”

“Even though the Walter Troop at the back is also strong, we’re the real elite troop!”

“Well, we or them, we are all……’

Suddenly.

Pbabababat!

The grass greatly shook and the Walter Troop located at the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s rear split to the sides.

“Wha what the?”

“What’re they doing?”

The Owells Forces’ soldiers, at the Walter Troop’s incomprehensible action, tilted their heads.

At that moment.

“March forwards!”

“Charge!”

With resounding voices, the Tale Legion, Lancephil Legion, and the Walter Troop all pounced towards the Owells Forces.

“Eh?!”

“Eh?”

At the attacks that poured down without discriminating the front and the sides, the Owells Forces scrambled about.

They still hadn’t understood the Walter Troop’s action.

‘Walter has betrayed? No. That isn’t the Walter Troop!’

Kali, who was analyzing the battle situation, intuitively perceived that the things had gone wrong.

He quickly raised his sword up high and shouted aloud.

“Retreat! Retreat! We are returning to our camp!”

If them having fallen into a trap was the truth, then it was a situation where they couldn’t avoid complete annihilation.

They had to escape the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s encirclement and once again moved back towards the Arslan Valley.

Soon following that, numerous commanders busily moved.

“Retreat!”

“We’ve fallen into a trap! Retreat!”

The Owells Forces’ common soldiers only then also realized that the things had gone wrong.

“Uah! Ruan!”

“The enemy are rushing towards us!”

The Owells Forces’ soldiers who stood at the head squalled with completely scared expressions.

However, the retreat wasn’t easy.

The rear troop was still charging towards the eastern forests.

Due to that, the rear troop that was trying to charge and the head troop that was trying to retreat tangled and a complete disorder arose at the Arslan Valley’s entrance.

“You idiots! Retreat! I said retreat!”

“We’ve fallen into a trap!”

Rebuking voices pierces through the sound of rain.

“Trap? It’s a trap?”

“Damn it! Don’t push! It’s a trap!”

“Retreat! Retreat!”

A moment too late, the rear troop’s soldiers stopped their charge and moved back.

But the sight was still that of them running about in confusion.

In the middle of that, only one person was maintaining his calm.

‘I knew it will be like this!’

He was in fact Demis Izy.

Demis, who had already noticed the unusual inkling at the western forests and subtly moved to the rear, creased his forehead at the gruesome battle unfolding at the front.

‘Damn it.’

Once again, he shook his head at Roan’s abilities and schemes.

‘Knowing that the Walter Troop was approaching from the east, they ambushed and annihilated them and then lured us into a scuffle using the armors of Walter Troop’s soldiers.’

The left arms’ blue clothes must be the method to separate allies from enemies.

Of course, this was thoroughly Demis’ own thought.

He, no, every one of Owells Forces including him believed that Roan had already seen through their plan and then had defeated the Walter Troop.

Not a single one could think that Walter Owells had betrayed them.

‘It’s good that I slipped out to the most rear.’

Demis exhaled a sigh of relief and moved back.

Together with the troop members below him, he quickly began to retreat.

Dududududu!

Sound of horse hooves shook the ground.

Demis and his troop quickly ran between the Arslan Valley and entered into the western forests once again.

‘There was confusion, but it seems that we can somehow retreat.’

When he lightly glanced back, the Owells Forces’ main army was pouring out through the valley’s entrance.

Although they had taken significant damage, it looked like they could at least avoid complete annihilation.

“Huu.”

A long sigh flowed out.

There was only the work of keep running and returning to the camp like this left.

No, he thought it was left.

But at that moment.

Ssweaaaaak!

Abruptly, sharp sound of something cutting through the air was heard.

Simultaneously, tens, hundreds of arrows flew towards them from the western forests.

Pbuk! Pbububuk! Pbuk!

Demis’ subordinates, who had been retreating without trouble, became porcupines and fell.

“Wha, what?”

At the unpredicted attack, Demis goggled his eyes.

Perhaps on the east, but at west, no troop that would attack them existed.

No, it shouldn’t have existed.

The west was entirely Owells Forces’ territory.

At that moment, Demis’ face stiffly solidified.

“Tha, that is?”

On the left arms of the soldiers that were pushing out and entering from the western end of the forests.

There, blue clothes were wrapped around.

“I, it’s the enemy!”

Demis convulsively shouted.

“It’s the enemy! The enemy! The ones that wrapped blue clothes on their left arms aren’t the allies but enemies! Don’t be fooled by the crest carved on their armors!”

Sound ringing the battlefield.

Demis’s troop’s soldiers, who momentarily panicked at the abrupt ambush attack, gritted their teeth and pulled out their weapons.

‘We need to pierce through those bastards to return to the camp.’

‘If our legs get held here, we’ll suffer an encirclement attack.’

‘The back of our heads may get hit by a sword.’ 1

The desire to live dominated their heads.

They kicked off the ground and recklessly charged.

If they had calmed their heads a bit more and comprehended the situation, they might have felt that something was strange.

But the point that the fake Walter Troop that appeared at the rear wrapped blue clothes to their left arms, the point that thick forests were greatly dark due to the weather that accompanied a violent torrent of rain, and their most basic desire to live stormed and disallowed them to make rational judgment.

“You bastard! To think you’ll dare think of using the remnant soldier disguise scheme again!”

“You’ve thought of us too easily!”

“Kill them! The ones wearing the blue cloths are the real allies!”

Walter Troop was greatly misunderstanding the situation in their own way.

Of course, this was all due to the scheme of Walter, the troop commander.

Boom!

With a sound of explosion, the two troops crashed.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Together with metallic sounds, a fierce battle began.

The two troop’s soldiers thought that each other was the enemy, namely the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion.

But the truth was a battle of Owells Forces against Owells Forces.

Here, the Owells Forces’ main army that escaped out of the Arslan Valley a step late and the fake Walter Troop, Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion that had chased behind tangled up and an incredibly chaotic battle unfolded.

Of course, Roan did not needlessly entered deep into the fray.

‘Now, we will leave those bastards to shake their swords a round.’

Although the battle was being unfolded, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s damage was nearly nonexistent.

The battle was only unfolded between the Owells Forces.

A horrifying and horrendous battle of friends killing friends kept continuing on.

Of course, there were also ones who realized that the situation was odd from time to time.

“Eh? Beckel?”

“Ichin? Why are you? Did you actually surrender?”

“What are you saying? Aren’t you the one who surrendered?”

The cases where the ones that were pointing their swords at each other recognizing one another had broke out.

“Pe, perhaps?”

“Are we fighting amongst allies right now?”

Widely goggling their eyes, they raised their hands up high.

They were planning to at least shout as loud as they could.

“Everyone stop!”

“We’re all in the same……”

However, their wishes couldn’t be reached.

“Die!”

“Die! You son of bitches!”

From the back of each side, swords different from one another tore through the two people’s chest.

“Gurruk. Thi, this is, wro……”

Empty deaths.

All over the battlefield, events similar to this unfolded.

Demis too, only after hacking the enemy, no, the real Walter Troop’s soldiers for a long while, realized that something was wrong.

‘Why is there so many familiar looking guys?’

Although it wasn’t as if he knew all the common soldiers’ faces, even so, it wasn’t as if he completely didn’t knew them.

The guy who died just now with his own hand piercing his chest was definitely a subordinate that he had roamed the battlefields together with.

‘Surrendering? No. There’s no way.’

When his thought reached about that point, a shadow fell in front of his eyes.

The gaze that unknowingly looked back.

The eyes that simultaneously widen.

“You, you are……?”

Taken back, Demis tried to scream.

Ssskuk!

But a step ahead of that, a sharp sword cut Demis’ neck.

The sword’s owner, with cold eyes, glared at Demis’ head that had fallen onto the ground.

“Noticing it was too late.”

A voice devoid of emotion.

The one who cut Demis’ neck was in fact Walter.

He quickly moved his steps towards the next target.

Ssskuk. Sssguk.

Horrifying sounds were consecutively heard.

“Kuk!”

“Si, Sir Walter?”

The commanders all fell with shocked faces as if one.

The ones Walter was aiming for were commanders above adjutant level that practically moved the troops.

If it was like this, it seemed as if they could finish the battle more easier than he had thought.

But the Owells Forces’ commanders weren’t all fools.

Especially their leader and the source of this fief war, Kali Owells, was an outstanding man.

‘Something is wrong.’

Even in the middle of the chaotic battle, he read the leery, unpleasant, and somehow uncomfortable air.

A doubtful thought.

And the instant he saw the young general blocking the path of retreat while swinging his sword, that turned into certainty.

“Roberi!”

The voice cutting through the battlefield and ringing like a thunder.

Instantly, the Owells Forces, who were pointing their swords at each other, all faltered and trembled their hands.

“Si, Sir Viscount Owells?”

Roberi, who was seized by madness and was hacking the soldiers as if mad, discovered Kali and stiffly froze like a statue.

‘Something is wrong!’

In the first place, he was an outstanding man who would felt doubt even at Walter’s marching order.

Roberi quickly moved back.

“Halt the battle! Halt the battle! Move back!”

Soon, numerous commanders repeated the same words and the falteringly moved back along with the soldiers.

Silence.

Not the sound of metal, shouts, nor even the sound of scream was heard.

Prrurrurru.

Only the sound of horses blowing their mouths occasionally echoed out quietly.

“Roberi! What is this! For you to attack the allies!”

A frost-like roar.

Roberi’s face bleached white.

That was also the same for the other soldiers.

“The, then have we been fighting amongst allies all this time?”

“Come to think of it, aren’t those guys the real Walter Troop?”

“Eh? Look over there. That side’s also real main army’s soldiers.”

“Just how did this happen?”

Dazed expressions and overlapping voices.

At that moment, Roberi looked at Kali and shouted in a confused voice.

“I just don’t know how this has happened, sir! I have merely followed Sir Walter’s orders. Most definitely, he said that the ones wearing blue clothes are the real allies and the ones wearing only the armors are enemies who disguised as ally remnant……”

When his words reached about that point, Roberi and Kali as well as Owells Forces’ all commanders and soldiers’ faces were colored pale.

‘It’s a betrayal!’

‘Sir Walter has betrayed us!’

Finally, they could understand all the circumstances.

They had been thoroughly played with.

By the man named Walter Owells.

‘No, behind him, Roan must have be there.’

Kali, with an expression as if having chewed on a gall, shouted.

“Walter! Where is Walter!”

It was a voice filled with rage.

Beyond blood relations, his heart felt like scraping out the bastard’s heart even immediately.

But the sight of Walter couldn’t be seen anywhere.

At that moment.

“Kali. Have you finished all your chat?”

From east of the forests, from the side of the Arslan Valley’s entrance, a quiet but powerful voice was heard.

The man pushing through the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion that had wrapped around the Owells Forces as if to encircle them.

The young man riding a large warhorse and slantly holding a long spear was in fact Roan.

Wearing a crimson armor, he stared straight at Owells Forces with panicked expressions.

“The look of you crying like a little girl is truly laughable.”

The venomous words tore at his chest.

“Roan!”

Kali couldn’t hold himself back and shouted.

He didn’t expect to be humiliated so completely.

But it wasn’t the end with this.

‘Now that we’ve checked that we’re on the same side, the retreat path has definitely opened.’

If he return to the camp and then reorganize the formation, he could counterattack as much as he wish.

Like that, the one strand of pride that was left flamed his reasons and emotions.

“Do you thinking of running away?”

Roan softly smiled as he shook his head.

A relaxed look.

Although his emotions burst and the rage soared, Kali forcefully and tightly suppressed and endured.

‘I will definitely take revenge!’

The light in his eyes blazingly burned up.

Roan looked at that sight and deeply inhaled.

“Kali. Now give up. You cannot run.”

“Hmph! You’re overly confident!”

Kali snorted and then pointed at the Walter Troop at the rear.

“We have taken control of the western path of retreat.”

It was a situation where they could easily escape out of the forest.

‘If the rear troop stops them with their lives on the line, that is……’

If it was for himself to live, it didn’t matter whether hundreds or thousands of soldiers died en masse.

Either way, the important thing was Kali, himself.

At that moment.

“Control the path of retreat…… Kali, you bastard has now even lost your sight.”

Roan loudly chided in a cold voice.

“What?!”

Creasing his brows, Kali shouted aloud.

Following that, Roberi, who was controlling the western path of retreat, roared with a brightly flushed face.

“Roan you bastard! Can you not see me!”

It truly was a bold spirit.

But Roan instead snorted and shook his head.

“I do not have the gift of seeing dead men.”

They were incomprehensible words.

Roberi creased his brows.

“Dead men? Who are you saying is dead!”

At that moment.

Ssskuk!

A sharp sword cut apart Roberi’s side in a long line and pierced through and exited from his chest.

“Wa, what is this……”

At the situation that suddenly unfolded, Roberi goggled his eyes and turned his head looking for the sword’s owner.

A large swordsman standing right next to him.

He shouted in a resounding voice.

“Who is dead? It’s you, of course!”

A hearty spirit gushed out from his entire body.

“Gurruk. Who, who are yo……”

Even while his breath passed away, Roberi tried to find the identity of the swordsman that pierced his chest.

The swordsman put strength into his wrist to pulled out the sword again, then shouted once again in a resounding voice.

“I’m the Tale Legion’s vice-commander and the Piedes Troop’s three-thousand-man Commander, Austin!”

Finally, the familiar face appeared below the deeply worn helmet.

Austin, who had received Roan’s secret order before the Arslan Battle began and moved first.

After leading the fake Walter Troop and inciting the chaotic battle, he had stealthily infiltrated between the real Walter Troop.

“Ro, Roberi!”

Kali shouted with a thunderstruck expression.

“T, Troop commander!”

“Troop commander Roberi!”

The nearby soldiers too wailed with dumbfound expressions.

Kali raged.

“Kill him! Kill that bastard!”

Pointing at Austin, he exploded out with madness.

But at that moment, Roan’s calm and soft voice brushed the ears once again.

“Well. Could they do so? Even though the dead cannot move.”

“What does……”

Kali creased his brows.

At that instant, Austin raised his sword up high and shouted in a loud voice.

“Flip the cloth!”

They were incomprehensible words.

But the change that single sentence brought was truly great.

Flip!

The soldiers located at the outer side of the Walter Troop flipped the blue cloth wrapped on their left arms.

Suddenly, the clothes’ color turned red.

Shape of the fake Walter Troop wearing red clothes having perfectly surrounded the real Walter Troop that was still wearing the blue clothes.

“Ah……”

“No, no way!”

“Just when did they……”

Dispirited sounds flowed out everywhere.

Because it was such as chaotic battle, no one was able to notice the fake Walter Troop that Austin led crossing the battlefield and permeating into the real Walter Troop.

Roan faintly smiled and raised the Travias Spear up high.

“Crimson Legion.”

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion, and the fake Walter Troop on top of that.

Every soldier leaned his ears at Roan’s voice.

Roan kicked his horse and shouted at the top of his lungs.

“Swallow up the Owells Forces!”

The instant the order was given, all the soldiers, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion, and even the fake Walter Troop, pounced towards the Owells Forces.

“Waaaaa!”

“Kill them!”

“Wipe out the enemy!”

It was literally a storm-like charge.

“Uuuu.”

“Uaaah!”

The Owells Forces’ soldiers unconsciously trembled with their entire body.

They all felt their death.

Ssskuk! Sssguk! Ssskuk!

Horrifying sounds fully filled the battlefield.

The battle was one-sided.

Especially Roan’s might shined once again.

Literally a godly might.

He showed off the might of a god.

A giant spearhead of water, together with the violent torrent of rain, split the Owells Forces’ soldiers.

The Owells Forces’ knights and soldiers, whose morales had already fallen all the way to the bottom, were no match for Roan.

But even within that while, there were few who bravely struggled on alone.

“Sir Viscount! Sir Viscount at least escape!”

“Secure a path!”

“Pierce through a path with your lives!”

The old veterans who had roamed the battlefields for a long time together with Kali.

The commanders who respected and admired not wealth and power but Kali himself sacrificed their lives to secure a path.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

In front of the charge of the old veterans who had disregarded death, even the Taemusas who prided in their group battle abilities began to be slowly pushed back.

Ssskuk!

With a horrifying sound, one Taemusa fell.

At that instant!

Paat!

A very small gap appeared.

“Sir Viscount!”

“Sir Viscount Owells! Quick!”

Urgent and desperate voices rang out.

At the old veteran’s shouts, Kali kicked his horse.

He did not threw a single word of thanking or swearing revenge.

He didn’t even threw a shout filled with rage towards Roan.

Merely.

‘I have to live! I have to live! I must live! Rather than the lives of those old men, my one life is much more valuable! Of course!’

Kali’s thought was only that thought.

It was to a point that the veterans’ loyalties were regretable.

“Please persevere your life, sir.”

They, without even knowing Kali’s such thought, or perhaps even while knowing that, saluted and lowered their heads.

It was a truly doleful sight.

“My lord! Owells is escaping!”

“Kali is escaping, sir!”

Bernard and Andre shouted with hurried expressions.

Roan, who was cutting the necks of Owells Forces’ knights, looked at the sight of Kali’s back getting further away and shook his head.

“I will leave Kali Owells…… to him.”

It was a somewhat forlorn voice.

Bernard and Andre soon understood those words’ meaning and slowly nodded their heads.

Ssskuk!

Roan once again cut a knight’s neck and then shouted in a loud voice.

“Flood them! The battle has not ended yet!”

The sound echoed the battlefield.

“Waaaah!”

Once again, the crimson legion’s spirit boiled up.

But unlike Roan’s words, the battle was already no different than having ended.

It was because even the Owells Forces’ soldiers who resisted at least saw Kali run away and had completely lost their will.

“Uak!”

“Kuuk!”

Now, only the sound of screams instead of metal were abundant.

Plopplopplopplop.

The violently falling streaks of rain washed away the sorrowful sounds.

The crimson legion’s complete victory as well as a grand victory.

The decisive battle carved with blood and washed in rain, the Arslan battle ended like that.

No, for now, the battle at the Arslan Valley ended like that.

What was left was only one, the aged feelings between the father and the son.

The Decisive Battle End.

T/N: Hello. Sorry about the tardiness of the chapters, and although this is rather awkward for me to say it, there’s a one more bad news; and yes, it’s directly tied to the reason this chapter was late. In the coming three weeks, I’ll be having my college midterms: specifically, an exam for a psychology class on next Tuesday, two exams on the following Monday and Tuesday for Spanish and another psychology class, and a statistics exam on the Thursday after that week.

Due to this, I’ll only be able to post one chapter per week during those three weeks, and will most likely be released on Weekends. So for the following three weeks, do please expect the chapters sometime between Saturdays and Sundays.

Also, this is a bit minor, but what do you think of the new placement of t/n section? Is it better or worse?

“getting hit on the back of one’s head” is a phrase for “getting betrayed”, though there is no mention of the “sword”. So this sentence actually works either way. ↩

Chapter 181




T/N Update: ch. 182 may be a day or so delayed. Just found out that even Kuhaku is busy until Wednesday next week, so I’ll have to look for another PR to step in for the time. Sorry about the inconvenience.

“Haa! Haa! Haa!”

Rough breaths touched the horse’s back.

Viscount Kali Owells couldn’t even bear to look back.

He simply kept continued to kick the horse.

At that moment.

Paat!

Together with a heavy sound, a hard and thick rope bounced up.

The front leg of the warhorse that had been breathlessly running got caught on the rope.

“Neeeign!”

The warhorse lost its balance and violently rolled down.

“Haa!”

Kali slightly panicked at the abruptly unfolded event, but he quickly threw his body and jumped into the air.

Chang!

He drew out his sword the very instant he took balance and got down on the ground.

There wasn’t even the leisure to check the horse’s condition.

‘I, is it an ambush?’

A cold sweat flowed.

At that moment, a quiet and melancholic voice was heard from his back.

“That’s quite a good luck.”

Instantly, Kali’s face twisted.

It was a familiar voice.

The voice of the bastard who he wanted to find so much just before.

“Walter.”

Kali grinded his teeth and turned his body towards the direction the voice was heard.

From the end of the tightly fasten rope, a young man approached.

As expected, the young man’s identity was Walter Owells.

“Rather than the bold and arrogant look, the sight of you running away in fear is much more pleasant looking.”

A cold voice.

With a stiffly solidified expression, Kali shouted.

“Walter! Do you know what you have just done!”

Walter, slowly nodding his head, pulled out the sword at his waist.

“Of course. I’m merely facing an enemy commander.”

“Enemy commander?”

Kali twisted his eyes.

He roared with a cold voice.

“I’m you bastard’s father!”

“Father? Ha.”

Walter, with a stiffly solidified expression, snorted.

Kali’s face was still twisted.

“Are you perhaps saying that you’ll point your sword at your blood? You’ll kill your family? Why? For what? You and Io Lancephil are strangers whose blood haven’t even mixed a single drop. Are you saying that you’ll cut your family’s neck for him? Or is it because of Roan? Just what is the reason you’re doing this!”

Voice that openly rubbed off with rage and desperation.

Perhaps a pursuit troop might appear beyond the hill, he was in a greatly restless state.

A cold smile hung around Walter’s mouth.

“Family? Blood? It doesn’t sound like words that a man who killed his wife and daughter should be saying.”

“Kill? Whose wife and daughter did I kill…… are you perhaps talking of the Arslan Brigand event?”

The Arslan Brigand event.

Until they were subjugated by Io, the Arslan Brigand was a large-scale brigand that showed off a mighty power with the Arslan Valley as their main base.

Not only attacking the merchants and passersby that traversed the valley, they even pillaged the nearby region’s villages and spread their infamy.

Although the fief tried to subjugate them multiple times, it was absolutely not easy because their main base was located at the most precipitous place even within the Arslan Valley.

During that while, an absurd event occurred.

“Arslan Brigand Event. So you haven’t forgotten. Exactly ten years ago, mother and litter sister who had been coming back from my grandparents’ house were captured by the Arslan Brigand.”

That was the very Arslan Brigand event.

“Ghmm.”

Kali crinkled his nose with an uncomfortable look.

Walter disregarded it and continued his words.

“They said that they’ll free mother and sister as long as we pay them the ransom. But father refused.”

“Are you saying a kingdom’s noble should yield to a mere brigand? That is something that cannot be.”

Kali boldly answered with effort.

Walter snorted.

“Hmph. If you cannot give money to mere brigands, shouldn’t you have came up with a rescue plan at least?”

His voice became louder.

“But father did nothing. You didn’t give the ransom, nor did you organize a troop and march.”

“Tha, that is……”

Kali stuttered with a slightly panicked look.

Walter’s face solidified even colder.

“Father was mindless receiving and flattering Duke Bradley Webster who visited the Pavor Castle at that very day.”

“Ghmm.”

Once again, Kali swallowed a groan with an uncomfortable look.

It was true.

On the day his wife and daughter were kidnapped, Kali was doing all sort of flattering in order to climb up to a higher place.

It was that he wished to most definitely get within the sight of Bradley Webster, who was one of the kingdom’s four dukes.

The tips of Walter’s eyes sharply trembled.

“When father was tilting cups of wine with Duke Bradley Webster, mother and sister forlornly died after suffering all kinds of vice.”

Rage surged up.

Understandably, Kali’s action at the time was greatly unusual.

In case that the banquet will be canceled if the truth that his wife and daughter were kidnapped were possibly known, he had thoroughly remained silent.

Thanks to that, he was solidly pressed by Count Io Lancephil after this truth was later revealed and had to remain as the knight order’s vice-executive without advancing for a long time.

‘A man who throws away his family for his ambition……’

That was Kali.

Kali quietly stared at Walter’s cold gaze.

The excuses were about to begin.

“Walter. I have merely made the best decision for our house. I too loved my wife and daughter. But because I had you……”

When the words reach about that point, Walter raised his sword and gritted his teeth.

“I know. Why father threw away mother and sister so easily……”

That was all.

“Because I was there. Because I, the firstborn who would lead the house even if mother and sister died, was there, you probably made such a heartless choice. But that very choice’s reason……”

Walter’s eyes sorrowfully shined.

“Has pained me so much.”

Certainly, there was not a single fault of his own.

But as Walter became older and older, he became wrapped in the shame that his mother and sister’s deaths were his own fault.

At that moment, the one who became his support was in fact Count Io Lancephil.

He could only become the support.

At the time, Io personally led the knight order, the magic corp, and the fief regiment and marched after hearing the news Walter’s mother and sister had been kidnapped much later, and had subjugated the Arslan Brigand after a month of a large battle.

Although it was late, it was a greatly different sight compared to Kali, who had feigned ignorance of the kidnapping of his family for his own ambition.

“Father. When your eyes had gone dark from ambition, the man who had looked after and raised me at that time was in fact Sir Io Lancephil.”

From the start, Io greatly valued Walter’s talent.

He embraced Walter, who had received a large shock, with his chest and raised him with his heart.

Thanks to that, Walter was able to recover faster than expected.

But despite so, he had no confidence to live while facing Kali’s face.

He went out of the house that was like hell and comforted his heart’s wound while studying at the Pavor Academy.

And the one he met at that time was Mary Tate, who was his fiancé right now, and he was able to meet even Roan thanks to her.

It truly was a perverse relation and fate.

“The very bottom fits men like father. You would only pain many people the more and more you go up to a higher place.”

The tip of his sword slightly trembled.

Although he had swallowed a firm resolve, pointing his sword at his father was much more painful and agonizing thing than he had thought.

Kali did not miss that very point.

“As expected, you bastard’s heart is soft……”

It was the personality that did not pleased him so much, and that he had wanted to fix in any way possible.

But for that very personality to become a help now.

“Huu.”

Kali spat out short breath and looked straight at Walter’s eyes.

“Do you truly plan to stop me?”

At those words, Walter shook his head.

“No.”

“Hm?”

Kali, at the unexpected answer, creased his brow.

Walter, with a coldly sank voice, added on.

“I plan to kill you.”

Instantly, Kali’s face stiffly solidified.

“Impertinent bastard.”

A cold voice abruptly shot out.

‘I cannot delay any longer.’

His heart became impatient.

Whether the pursuit troop may have already reached his near was something he couldn’t know.

He put strength into the hand holding his sword.

“Don’t resent your father.”

Finally, Kali made his heart’s decision.

‘Something like children, I can simply give birth to more.’

He was still young.

He thought that if it was children, he could simply give birth to more.

But Kali too did not knew his own heart simply too much.

Tat!

Kali kicked the ground and ran towards Walter.

Kali, who was known as most outstanding knight amongst Io’s subordinates, began to swing his sword with his own son Walter as the opponent.

‘There is no one stronger than me in the Count Lancephil House!’

It was Kali’s pride.

He didn’t think even a bit of fighting Walter and losing.

But.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

With just four strikes of the sword, the pride that had been solid greatly shook.

‘This bastard……?’

Kali, with a greatly surprised light in his eyes, looked at Walter.

‘He’s much stronger than I thought.’

The heavy strength felt through the palm.

Not only that, his body movement and sword movement were light and without waste.

‘He was this strong?’

It was unbelievable.

Walter was a rookie knight who just graduated the academy.

The experiences must be short and the quality of his mana too should be lacking.

But.

‘He’s similar to me.’

It was a surprising revelation.

He knew that he didn’t miss the top throughout the time he attended the knight school.

But even so, he thought that it was at a degree of showing prominence amongst the students.

‘Even if I didn’t knew, it seems I knew too little.’

He newly had a thought that the things he knew of his son Walter was simply too few.

Simultaneously with dejection, rage soared up.

‘Even though he has this much skill, for him to want to become another’s dog on his own!’

If it was this much swordsmanship skill and level of mana, it should be enough to greatly shine the Owells House.

As he thought that such bastard was pointing his sword at the house, his rage surged up even more.

“You foolish bastard!”

Kali completely pulled up his mana and pushed Walter on.

Although it was regrettable and lamentable, as he had decided to throw him out, he planned to surely kill him.

He definitely thought to do so.

The sword moved even more shrewdly.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Together with metallic sounds, sparks flew.

Spat! Sskuk!

Occasionally, each’s sword brushed past the cloths on each’s arm and sides.

The fierce melee kept continuing on.

“Die!”

A horrid sound burst out from Kali’s mouth.

He pulled up his entire mana and threw a mortal blow.

On the other side, Walter clenched his teeth and unfolded a counterattack.

He absolutely did not move back.

Watching straight at the blade flying towards him, he clenched his teeth.

The two people’s blades passed by as if to brush.

If like this, it was a mutual death.

Tung.

Suddenly, Walter’s sword greatly shook.

The tightly closed mouth slightly opened.

The eyes that were resolute without a tremble too greatly shook.

‘Ah…… father……’

At the final moment, Walter ended up twisting his sword.

He thought he could kill him.

Because the rage that filled his heart was so big, he thought that he could cut his neck and stab his chest.

But at the decisive moment, the old past he had forgotten floated up.

The young Kali who was teaching the little brat Walter the sword.

His father Kali of that time when he had once looked up to the most had floated up.

‘Was my resolve only this much……’

Like Kali’s words, Walter’s heart was too soft.

He couldn’t stab the sword at his father’s chest.

Feeling the blade falling down, he quietly closed his eyes.

On the other hand, Kali’s sword had no trembling.

No, it looked to be so.

‘Damn it!’

Kali clenched his teeth.

The sword that was heading towards Walter’s chest adroitly twisted.

Ssskuk!

The blade drew a long line and cut off Walter’s left arm.

“Kuuk!”

An intense pain stormed.

Dropping his sword, Walter grabbed his left shoulder with his right hand.

The red spouted out like a fountain.

But he never dropped nor shouted.

He simply stood and looked straight at Kali’s eyes.

“Even to the end, they’re disrespectful and arrogant eyes.”

Kali raised his sword while biting his lower lip.

‘I have to kill him. I can’t leave a future trouble.’

Kali raised his sword up high.

Walter quietly watched that sight.

The light in his eyes were still bold but somehow sad.

“Kuuk.”

Kali bit his lips.

The hand that was holding the sword sharply shook.

It absolutely wasn’t because the sword was heavy.

“Go to some remote countryside and live as if dead.”

Simultaneously, Kali’s sword stabbed Walter’s lower abdomen.

“Kuk.”

Walter gritted his teeth.

It wasn’t as painful as when his left arm was cut off.

But the despair was much greater than back then.

‘Mana has disappeared.’

A dejected feeling.

Kali had destroyed Walter’s mana hole.

“You bastard is the Owells House’s man no more.”

Kali quietly scolded, then disappeared into the west while riding the warhorse.

Watching the back of Kali that was getting away, Walter dropped his knees just like that.

The sight became blurry.

“Father……”

At the instant when he was losing his consciousness, he spat out that word that he would never again would call.

Like that, Walter became an orphan.

*****

After taking a complete victory in the Arslan Battle, Roan marched north with a sweeping spirit.

The Owells Forces’ remnants, who were scattered in the eastern region with the Pavor Castle as the starting point, threw down their weapons and surrendered even from just seeing the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s flags.

Big and small castles and nearby regions were also the same.

Ones who had helplessly lowered their heads at Kali all sweared their loyalty to Roan.

Thanks to that, Roan, the Tale Legion, and the Lancephil Legion were able to enter the Pavor Castle within merely four days after the Arslan Battle had ended.

“Waaaah!

“Roan! Roan!”

“Roan Lancephil! Roan Lancephil!”

The Pavor residents came out to the grand street crossing the castle and cheered.

They had to tremble day after day not knowing when the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces would come and invade.

And during that while, the news of Roan’s grand victory was reached.

It was a situation where they couldn’t help being cheerful and happy.

“That sir is the new Sir Count, right?”

“Right! Right! As expected of our Count Io Lancephil, no, the previous Sir Count’s eyes for people are the best!”

“Since our new Sir Count was famous for being a good person even from the past.”

The sound of people’s laughter burst out from every place.

They sent lavish claps and cheers towards not only Roan but also the legion’s soldiers who had endured laborious battles.

“Waaaah!”

“Hahaha!”

Cheerful and bright sounds continued on for a long time.

But.

“Eh? Look over there! Isn’t that guy perhaps……?”

Soon, few people began to whisper with serious expressions.

“Isn’t that bastard that Owells House guy?”

“Right, right! He’s definitely Kali Owells’ son.”

“He’s Walter or something bastard, right?”

The Pavor residents glared with their eyes and spat out curses.

The place their gazes touched.

On top of the warhorse that was just getting into the inside of the castle gate sat Walter, who had deeply dropped his head.

His left shoulder was tightly tied up.

“Hey! You bastard! How dare you bastard come here!”

“Traitor bastard!”

“Get out now, Kali’s son!”

The abuses gradually become more intense.

Even.

“Eit!”

One of the castle’s residents picked up a stone that was rolling around and threw it.

Puuk!

The stone directly hit Walter’s shoulder.

“Kuk.”

Crimson blood flowed from the shoulder.

It was a pitiable and miserable sight.

But the castle’s residents, who felt a great rage at Kali’s betrayal, did not shook from that such sight.

“Eit!”

“Die!”

“Get out!”

Soon, people picked up and threw stone from everywhere.

Puck! Pubuck! Puck!

Walter, without a thought of dodging or blocking, quietly sat and got struck by stone.

At that moment.

Puuk!

A dull sound hit the ears.

“Eh?”

“My, my lord!”

The castle’s citizens who were thoughtlessly throwing the stones as well as the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers shouted with greatly shocked expressions.

At Walter’s side, Roan was already there.

Crimson blood flowed from his forehead.

He had gotten struck instead by the stone the Pavor Castle’s resident had thrown towards Walter.

“My, my lord!”

Austin approached with a startled expression.

“All of you listen well.”

It was a soft and calm voice.

The castle’s residents swallowed dry spit and leaned their ears at Roan’s voice.

Walter who was still dropping his head was also the same.

He quietly watched the hard and giant back that stood across in front of him.

“Whether whose son Walter is is not important.”

Strength went into his voice bit by bit.

“If you will throw stones at him, throw it at me.”

But it completely was not pressuring.

A giant and soft spirit that greatly wrapped around and embraced all filled the Pavor Castle fully.

Roan stared at Walter for a moment, then spoke in a loud voice.

“Walter is my knight.”

Coincidentally, a warm western wind blew.

Walter, who was watching Roan’s back, clenched his teeth.

Something hot surged and filled up all the way to his throat.

At that moment, the commanders above thousand-man rank including Austin swarmed up to Walter’s surroundings.

A sight of surrounding him as if to protect.

Austin looked back and forth between Roan and Walter, then shouted in a resounding voice.

“Walter is!”

As soon as his words finished, the commanders above thousand-man rank shouted simultaneously.

“Our brother!”

Burning voices.

It was a burning declaration.

Chapter 182




“They’re finally moving.”

Clay put down a paper about the size of a palm and formed an odd smile.

He had perhaps wondered, but it was as expected.

‘Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild. You’ve waited well for quite a long time.’

He more or less knew that they were moving while receiving someone’s secret orders.

But through the current fief war, the identity of that dark screen had been revealed certainly.

‘Count Jonathan Chase. You truly have moved busily, sir.’

The Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild relocating to Mediasis Castle was at the time when Roan was a baron.

Looking from the central politics, it was a time when there wasn’t anything so special.

And Count Jonathan Chase had been guarding against Roan since that time.

‘Well, even though the mercenary guild he laboriously planted has actually become useless……’

The smile that hung around Clay’s mouth became much thicker.

Currently, the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild was under a meticulous surveillance.

They were checking not only the people that entered and exited the place, but also their private papers as easily as shifting through a drawer inside their own house.

Although it was thanks to the Agens and the druids’ abilities, but the ones who played the biggest role was in fact the Tenebra Troop.

Few members of the Tenebra Troop, which was an espionage troop, had been infiltrating the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild.

And for quite a long time at that too.

They piled up their achievements step by step and finally, three people amongst the agents had climbed up onto the guild executive positions.

Especially.

‘In the case of Lepis, agent name Griffith, he has became a heavyweight entering within the top five even inside the guild.’

He was also receiving the affection of Powell, the current guild master.

‘Huhuhu. The mercenary guild has already and essentially been taken over by us.’

Even from Roan and his retainers’ position, it was a plan that they had poured their hearts and souls into for quite a long time.

Putting away the letter, Clay thoroughly checked the plan from now on.

At that moment.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Sound of knocking quietly rang.

“Sir, Captain Pichio of the Mediasis Guard has came.”

“Tell him to come in.”

Clay stood up from his seat as he slightly tilted his head.

Soon, the door opened and Pichio with a slightly stiffen expression appeared.

After meeting the Lancephil Guardian Army at the Landingham Region together with Roan, Pichio had currently returned to Mediasis Castle.

“What’s the matter? Captain Pichio.”

Clay offered a seat on one side as he asked in a gentle voice.

Pichio, with a stiffly solidified expression, answered.

“While patrolling the castle, I got a bad feeling, sir.”

It was a feeling he didn’t get before.

It wasn’t because he had returned after a long time.

“A bad…… feeling, sir?”

Clay slightly frowned.

Abrupt and disjointed words.

But he had no plan to indifferently listen or to send him away even so.

The one who taught Roan of Pichio’s instinct ability was in fact Clay.

‘I can’t turn my ears away from Captain Pichio’s such words, that is.’

He quietly sat and stared at Pichio’s eyes.

Pichio quickly answered.

“I looked around the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild, sir, and the guild master and the executives’ actions were suspicious. I don’t have any definite evidence or any circumstantial evidence, but it felt like they were scheming something, sir. And that wasn’t really a good feeling.”

Even while speaking on his own, he thought that it was ridiculous.

But because of the uncomfortable feeling that fully filled his head and chest, he couldn’t hold himself back.

“Hah……”

Clay let out a quiet exclamation.

He hadn’t predicted Pichio’s instinct to possibly be transcendental to this degree.

‘Is this something possible with a human’s ability?’

He soon shook his head.

‘Although I have read numerous kinds of books without discrimination, I have never seen a man with this kind of abili…… ah!’

Abruptly, Clay widely opened his eyes and stared at Pichio.

“Captain Pichio. Captain said that you had lost your parents since you were young and lived alone, yes?”

“That’s right, sir. My parents had caught an epidemic the year I turned eleven and have passed away.”

Pichio slightly flustered at the abrupt question, but soon nodded his head.

In a quiet voice, Clay cautiously asked.

“What kind of people were your parents, sir?”

“Eh? My parents?”

Pichio asked back with a puzzled look.

Clay nodded his head with a serious expression.

Since his face and posture was like that, Pichio couldn’t loosely answer.

“They were just ordinary people, sir. Just like other people, they farmed and gathered herbs. Ah! But instead, they knew how to read. I heard that they originally ran a rather large shop in the Istel Kingdom’s capital. They probably learned to read at that time.”

“Hmm. Was there perhaps other unique characteristics?”

Clay asked once again.

Pichio contemplated for a moment, then soon shook his head.

“There really was no such thing, sir. Why do you ask?”

“Ah…… no. I was wondering what kind of people the parents of a man as brilliant as Captain Pichio was, so I asked.”

“Ah…… yes.”

The light in Pichio’s eyes were still full of questions, but he didn’t ask again.

Since the important thing right now wasn’t that.

Clay too couldn’t ask any more and could only close his mouth.

‘An abnormally developed instinct. This is definitely……’

Within his head, countless tomes that he had read until now flapped open and passed by.

Amongst them, one story filled his head with a snap.

‘The hexers’ ability.’

Hexers.

It was the name of those who, through a spiritual ability, a different spell system than mages that is often called sorcery, govern or control man’s mind or rule the souls.

Although the druids, who controlled the nature, were also originally a part of hexers, they now separate and differentiate themselves from them.

The reason was that the hexers were receiving an even greater ostracization even before the druids.

Originally, the royalties, nobles, and such ruling classes held a severe repulsion towards the hexers who freely controlled man’s mind.

During that time, an event in the Estia Empire where a group of hexers tried to control the royalties’ mind and grow their faction was uncovered, and the ruling classes of the entire continent gathered their strengths and exterminated the hexers afterwards.

The small number of hexers who survived concealed their identities and hid away from the world.

‘Perhaps, Captain Pichio may be a descendent of the hexers.’

For now, it was purely an assumption.

In fact, there was no case of hexers showing themselves again until now.

‘Like how us druids hid our identities and retired deep into forests, the hexers too must be continuing their existence somewhere.’

Clay slightly bit his lower lip.

Although he still did not knew, the hexers were already moving in the dark.

Especially Bradley Webster, one of the Rinse Kingdom’s four dukes, was already hiding the hexers as his secret weapon.

‘Anyhow, he’s a man worth keeping at the side and watching.’

Clay stared at Pichio and formed a faint smile.

“Captain Pichio. That disagreeable and suspicious feeling you felt is……”

For now, there was the need to finish the work concerning the Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild.

For a while, Clay and Pichio shared a deep chat.

******

‘The questions have been untangled to a certain degree.’

Roan sat on a large chair and sank into a deep thought.

It had always been strange.

‘Why couldn’t someone as outstanding as Walter show himself in the last life?’

There wasn’t even a time when he heard that name.

That part had been odd from the moment he first met Walter.

‘I thought that perhaps he may had met an early death at a young age, but……’

Looking at the currently turning situation, it was certain that he had died in his father Kali Owell’s hand in the last life.

‘Right. Since Kali became the Lancephil Fief’s owner in the last life.’

Probably, Walter had resisted to the end and ultimately had his head cut off.

Although whether that was by Kali’s hand or by an order couldn’t be known.

But because it was like that, he probably wasn’t able to hear Walter’s name in the last life.

The question had been resolved.

But.

‘That price is too big.’

Walter’s arm being cut off and his mana hole being destroyed.

This was clearly because of Roan’s misjudgment.

He had judged that Walter’s rage of his father Kali was significant.

He had thought that he would be able to kill Kali or at least capture him if it was that much.

‘I too did not knew of Walter very well.’

Certainly, Roan had achieved a great growth while passing through a rank and file spearman to squad commander and adjutant, troop commander and legion commander.

But even so, everything couldn’t be perfect.

Until now, Roan had filled the parts he lacked with the retainers around him.

But this event at least was something that had happened under his independent decision and that very price was Walter’s serious injury.

‘I’ve made a heavy debt.’

Roan tightly clenched his fist.

Now that it had came to this, he himself must be responsible for Walter.

Although his left arm was cut off and his mana hole was destroyed, it wasn’t as if his life would end even so.

‘It would be good if he became a strategist or a tactician, and it would be good even if he became an administrative officer. If not that, even a druid or a mage is good too. If it’s Walter, if it’s Walter’s talent, he will definitely achieve it.’

At the very least and unlike the last life, he planned to make Walter’s name ring out throughout the entire kingdom, no, the entire continent in this life.

In fact, Roan had announced the works Walter had endured and achieved with Count Lancephil’s name right after the event of Pavor Castle residents’ stone throwing.

After the announcement, a large number of residents swarmed up to the mansion Walter was being healed in and asked for forgiveness.

Of course, although the residents who had lost their important people because of Kali still equated Kali and Walter and cursed and condemned him, embracing every one was originally an impossibility.

‘To say that one will receive everyone’s love and support would be a greed.’

A good person to someone could also be a bad person to another.

‘Because of that, the generosity to embrace even the people on the other side is needed.’

Because of that, Roan had opened the treasury of the fief lord’s castle for the fallen who had been sacrificed in the fief war and for their families while the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion were reorganizing.

He did not act sparingly.

To a point that the words the dead had become richer than the living, he unsparingly spread out the wealth.

Thanks to that, the loyalty of the fallens’ families as well as the even the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers towards Roan had greatly rose.

They had once again realized that Roan was someone who would absolutely not turn away and forget them even if they died.

“My lord. The preparation for the meeting has finished, sir.”

When the various thoughts were becoming deeper, Austin came up and lowered his head.

Together with a short sigh, Roan moved his feet.

It still wasn’t the moment to be submerged in sentimentality.

‘Depending on how I end the fief war, the position and the plans thereafter will change.’

Roan had no thought of being satisfied with the Lancephil Fief.

Although there wasn’t much time left, he planned to charge all the way to the Chase County.

As he entered into the meeting room, the commanders above thousand-man rank were spouting out fierce pressures.

The traces of having exchanged a burning debate right until Roan arrived was clear.

“My lord. We must immediately charge towards the enemy’s main army right now!”

“Before that, we must clean up the nearby regions and pressure the bastards to move back on their own.”

“Instead, what do you think of using the navy to hit their back, sir?”

As if they had been waiting, all kinds of proposals poured down.

Roan quietly sat and listened to all those proposals.

For a long while, the heated debate continued on.

Ultimately, Austin, who couldn’t keep watching, stepped up.

“Everyone, that much is enough. Now, let us hear the lord’s opinion.”

At those words, the commanders who had been raising their voices closed their mouths with coughs.

Roan quietly stared at them, then formed a faint smile.

“They are each and all excellent proposals.”

At those words, many commanders nodded their heads with proud expressions.

Tapping the table with his forefinger, Roan added on.

“For now, I plan to make a frontal attack on the Chase Legion’s main army.”

As soon as those words finished, Baron Bernard Landingham cautiously opened his mouth.

“But sir, their main army is still maintaining a sound strength. If we were to wage a grand battle, our side’s losses too will not be insignificant.”

At those words, Roan cheerfully smiled and answered shortly.

“At that place……”

A meaningful expression and voice.

“I have planted a shadow.”

*****

“Damn it. Just what is this sight?”

“You said it. I thought I’ll be hugging bitches and drinking wine in the Pavor Castle by now…… tch!”

“To think we’re still eating some watery soup in the fields.”

“This is all because of those stupid Owells Forces idiots.”

Unsettling expressions and voices.

The eyes of the Chase Legion’s soldiers were fierce.

The soldiers who were gathered at one place and drinking watery soup pointed their fingers at the Owells Forces’ soldiers who were sitting on the opposite corner.

“Even those things must be feeling hungry!”

Words purposely made aloud.

Suddenly.

“These sons of bitches really!”

One of the Owells Forces’ soldiers that had been staying quiet stood up.

A brightly flushed face.

Due to the unbearable rage and disgrace, his entire body sharply trembled.

“Hold it. Hold it.”

“Hey, sit down.”

The other Owells Forces’ soldiers bitterly smiled and pulled their comrade’s arm.

The soldiers who jumped up from his seat glared at the Chase Legion’s soldiers, then soon let out a short sigh.

In the end, he could only sit down again.

At that moment, the Chase Legion’s soldiers sarcastically japed and spat out curses.

“Hmph. Insane bastard. You dare glare your eyeballs? If you had that much of a resolve, you should’ve fought with your life.”

“You said it. Cowardly bitch abandoned his comrades just because he got scared.”

“Anyway, those bitches who are all looks on the outside should’ve all get beat up in the Arslan Valley.”

The mood became much colder.

“Hahahaha!”

“Kukuku.”

The laughters of the Chase Legion’s soldiers crawled the earth like a snake and digged into the ears of Owells Forces’ soldiers.

“Sorry. I can’t hold back anymore.”

The soldier who had jumped up just before once again kicked off the ground.

Tat!

Clenching his two fists, he ran towards the Chase Legion’s soldiers.

“Eh?! This bitch!”

The Chase Legion’s soldiers quickly stood up and faced the Owells Forces’ soldier that ran towards them.

In no time, the soldiers tangled into one and rolled on the ground.

Tudung!

Soup pots and bowls noisily rolled down.

“Don’t insult us!”

“What is he saying! This cowardly bitch!”

“You wanna die?!”

“I’ll really turn you into rags today!”

Together with insults, fists and kicks went back and forth.

“You…… you sons of bitches!”

“I can’t hold more than this!”

“Oi! Get them!”

Ultimately, the Owells Forces’ soldiers who had been watching too attacked with curses.

The two groups’ small fight soon spread to a large brawl between the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces.

It was just two days ago since Kali had returned to the Chase Legion’s camp together with the defeated soldiers.

Count Jonathan Chase and the Chase Legion’s commanders as well as even the common soldiers’ feelings of Kali and the Owells Forces’ soldiers weren’t good.

It was because the ones who had marched while so high up on their horses had suffered a grand defeat and returned.

And because the troops of Chase Legion that had left together was almost annihilated, the feelings couldn’t be good.

Although minor fights between the Chase Legion’s soldiers and the Owells Forces’ soldiers arose afterwards, the commanders pretended to not know such truth or quietly covered it up.

It was because they too were of the same feelings as the common soldiers.

But exactly because of such complacent management, a large fight like now and schism had arose.

Deng! Deng! Deng!

Together with the sound of gong, numerous commanders ran up.

But the soldiers, who had already let go of their reasons, weren’t easily separated from each other.

Punching and kicking towards each other, they spat out curses.

“Die! You stupid Owells Forces brats!”

“You arrogant Chase Legion bastards!”

It truly was a pandemonium.

At that moment.

From the place where they were tangled into one spot and fighting, there were soldiers who were subtly retreating back to the camp’s outside.

They were the Chase Legion’s soldiers who had offered the start of the this fight.

The ones who were inciting the Owells Forces’ soldiers while eating the watery soup.

“Eit! Stupid Owells brats!”

“Die! Die!”

Needlessly spitting out insults at the top of their lungs, they stealthily moved back.

Odd smiles were floated up on their faces.

Amongst them, one man murmured in a small voice.

“Regrettable, regrettable. Even though drawing out the Chase Legion and the Owells Forces’ discord is all our achievement.”

“You’re right. To think we can’t openly show it off……”

Another soldier too smacked his lips as if regrettable.

At that moment, the soldier who was the highest ranked amongst the group and the chief executive of this plan cheerfully smiled and spoke.

“That is……”

It was a voice soaked in pride.

“Us Tenebra Troop’s very fate.”

He lightly tapped the soldiers’ shoulders, then pointed with his chin.

“Now, let’s hurry. We need to get out before we get discovered.”

They still had work left to do.

Like that, the shadow that had been planted in the Chase Legion furtively disappeared following the sunlight.

Even after that, big and small fights incessantly arose in the Chase Legion’s camp.

The legion’s morales dropped as far as it could and their discipline too slackened.

That degree was so serious that it was to a degree where they couldn’t properly react to the change outside the camp.

And chancing under such chaos.

Vvuuuuuu!

Together with a grand sound of horn, Roan and the crimson legion appeared.

Finally, a battle that wasn’t a trick against trick, scheme against scheme, but a frontal battle had spread open.

Tie (2) End.

T/N: I’m sorry that this chapter was late. For now, Kuhaku and I finally managed to get free and finish this chapter. Additionally, the next release will be a double chapter (ch. 183 & 184) as usual on the following Tuesday. My next exam is on Thursday next week, so I now have a bit of a room to translate the usual amount.

Chapter 183




T/N: Sorry about the delay. Well then, without further ado, here is what are essentially the last two chatpers of the Fief War arc. For those who were saving up, the entire Fief War arc is essentially ch. 153 Poskein Subjugation (1) to Ch. 184 Tie (4).

There was neither schemes nor tricks.

It was a contest of strength against strength.

With the wide hills as the stage, the crimson legion and the Chase Legion unfolded a grand battle.

“Left wing advance!”

“Kavets Troop to the front! Efron Troop to the left!”

“Don’t get pushed back! Taemusas, charge!”

Pressing orders followed continuously.

Through hand signals and flag signals, and with sounds of gong, drums, and bells on top of them, complicated orders were rapidly passed.

Dududududu!

The cavalries rapidly circled the left and right wings and the infantry troops that had Taemusas at the lead rammed the main body of the enemy legion from the front.

“Damn it! Stop them! Don’t get pushed back!”

“Kill them! I said kill them!”

The Chase Legion’s commanders screamed like hell and spurred the soldiers.

But the Chase Legion, whose spirits had fallen as far as it could due to internal discord, couldn’t become the crimson legion’s match.

“Kuhhuk!”

“Kuk!”

With hollow sounds, the Chase Legion’s soldiers hopelessly fell down.

Within that maelstrom, there was an individual leading a hundred or so soldiers and sweeping the battlefield.

A crimson flame soared along the spearhead.

The very young man who was cutting the enemy soldiers’ necks with flawless spearmanship and exceptional horsemanship was Roan.

Leading his direct troop, the Amaranth, he was personally driving the enemy soldiers into a corner.

From a perspective, it was a rather reckless action.

Roan was one of the fief war’s directly-related people and the legion’s chief commander.

If he were to perhaps get hit by a blind sword and become killed or injured, the fief war would end as Count Jonathan Chase’s victory.

Baron Bernard Landingham and the numerous commanders who knew of such truth tried to stop Roan from personally entering the battle, but it did not go as they wished.

I am not a man who give orders to the soldiers but one who leads the soldiers.

They were Roan’s words.

Roan charged unstoppably towards the center of the enemy’s main army.

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil legion, watching Roan’s charge, fiercely blazed up.

“Follow the lord’s back!”

“Let us follow the lord’s back!”

The morales, which were already great, ferociously soared as if to pierce the sky.

Truly becoming one giant ball of fire, they swept the battlefield.

On the other hand.

“Uuuuh. Whe, where’s our lord?”

“Whe, where’s Sir Count Chase?”

“Where’s Sir Viscount Owells?”

Jonathan Chase, instead of being at the frontline, had moved back to the rear where it was safe.

Kali Owells’ situation was much worse.

Taking responsibility of the grand defeat before in the Arslan Battle, he had his troop’s command deprived.

The Owells Forces’ surviving soldiers were also the same.

While pushed to the rear, they were simply sucking on their fingers.

Thanks to that, the morales and spirits of the Chase Legion’s soldiers had fallen to the very bottom.

Boom!

Together with a sound of explosion, the Chase Legion’s soldiers were blown away.

The sight of his head and body were that of flames flying off.

Using the Flamdor Mana Technique, Roan unsparingly pulled up the heat.

If the heat showed its bottom, he could simply use the water energy.

Truly an unrestrained, unstoppable charge continued.

“Kuuk!”

“Kuk!”

Each time the Travias Spear moved, two or three soldiers lost their heads and fell.

That was also the same for the Chase Legion’s knights.

Even the knights, because their spirits had been broken as much as possible, couldn’t show off their complete skills.

Roan lightly took on two knights and swung his spear.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

Together with metallic sounds, attacks and defenses went back and forth.

At that instant, the members of the Amaranth Troop lunged from the two sides.

Ssskuk!

With ghastly sounds, spearheads pierced their chests.

The Amaranth, which was Roan’s direct troop, was the strongest troop whose soldiers were mostly Taemusas.

They, each raising their weapons, pressured the enemy army with superb strength.

Since the grand battle had begun, a one-sided battle continued to unfold.

“Sir Count Chase.”

Kali, who was watching the situation, tightly bit his lips.

Looking straight at Jonathan’s side, he shouted with a voice mixed with pent-up anger.

“Please permit our charge!”

He simply couldn’t endure.

The bastard who dropped him into hell was in front of his eyes.

“I will cut off and return with Roan’s head, sir!”

Voice full of killing intent.

A bold pressure spouted out.

Jonathan did not easily answered and glared at the battlefield.

‘It’s not easy.’

Although he didn’t wish to admit it, but the battle situation was definitely disadvantageous.

No, it wasn’t only the battle situation that was disadvantageous.

‘If I were to lose this battle, I will end up losing the Lancephil Fief’s western regions.’

Currently, Jonathan was occupying a half of the Lancephil Fief, the western regions.

But in the case he were to lose this grand battle, the possibility of losing his influence on the western regions was high.

‘Even though I haven’t retreated and stood to fight because of that……’

Even while knowing that the legion’s morales and spirits were a mess, he could only fight.

The moment he retreated, the victory of the fief war would had completely gone over to Roan.

‘I thought it would take quite a while until he found our camp, but……’

Within that while, he was planning to reorganize the legion and go out on a counterattack.

But as if he had grasped the camp’s location from the start, no, as if he had been watching everything, Roan showed up when the legion was most hectic.

‘Is it thanks to the druids? Or the intelligence groups?’

Jonathan repeated to ask himself, then soon shook his head.

The important thing now wasn’t that.

‘Damn it.’

But even so, getting angry and having his pride hurt couldn’t be helped.

Since just where had it gone wrong?

‘When a commoner spearman made Benjamin Doyle slip, I should have disposed of him.’

If it was at that time, he could have snapped his neck with a single finger.

‘At that moment, if Io Lancephil, that old bastard hadn’t caused a mess……’

Come to think of it, the one who had placed interference so that he couldn’t move his hand was Io Lancephil.

Bad fate truly was a bad fate.

‘I can’t step back like this.’

Even if he were to step back at the necessary time, there was a need to deplete Roan’s strength.

Jonathan spat out a short breath and looked at Kali.

“Are you confident?”

At the lightly asked words, Kali nodded his head.

“I’m confident, sir.”

Even if he did not, he had to.

Kali’s heart was feeling impatient.

It was a problem if his allies won, and it was also a problem if they lost.

‘If we lose, everything will end. But even so, if Count Chase defeats Roan without my help……’

He would become a useless card.

Being thrown away was obvious.

In any way possible, he had to cut in into the battle and raise a big achievement.

Jonathan was staring into Kali’s such heart.

“Lead your soldiers and charge. It would be nice if you brought me the victory.”

The feeling of truly wishing so was revealed through his eyes.

Kali lightly made a salute.

“I will most certainly do so, sir.”

I quickly got on his warhorse and raised up his sword high.

“Charge!”

A command shouted at the very top of his throat.

As if they had been waiting, the Owells Forces’ soldiers roared at the top of their lungs.

“Waaaaaah!”

It was a shout pouring out the stifling feelings.

Dudududududu!

With Kali at the head, the Owells Forces began their charge.

Although their number wasn’t quite a thousand, their spirits at least were great.

It was that the rage that had piled up until now had turned into morales.

Boom!

Together with a blast, the crimson legion and the Owells Forces clashed.

“Die!”

“Die!”

Ssskuk! Sssguk!

Swords and spears pierced each other’s chests.

The necks were slashed and the arms and legs were cut off.

It was a gruesome sight.

Kali fiercely dashed through that scene.

The goal was Roan.

Within his sight, there was only Roan.

“Roan!”

A thunderous roar shook the battlefield.

Roan, who had cut down a knight, turned his head and looked at Kali.

“Coward bastard, only your voice is big.”

With a cold smile, Roan kicked his horse.

Roan and Kali.

Pouring out ferocious spirits, the two charged towards each other.

And finally.

Chang!

With a sound of metal, the decisive fight began.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

The spear and the sword clashed and sparks flew.

A fierce exchange of attacks and blocks continued to follow.

“You brat!”

Kali swung his sword with a roar.

The path of the sword was complex yet also dizzying.

A situation where a wrist could fly off with a slightest inattention.

‘I will absolutely kill you bastard at the very least!’

Currently, Kali was in a state completely unburdened from things such as power nor ambition.

He focused his entire sense on Roan in front of his eyes.

The look of the swordsman Kali, who was once praised by Io as the greatest talent, was being revealed.

Boom!

As the spear and the sword clashed, a sound of explosion instead of metal blasted out.

‘Kuk.’

At the heavy strength felt through his palms, Roan clenched his teeth.

‘Is this his original strength.’

It definitely was great.

However, Kali had met a wrong opponent.

Although Roan’s original strength too was great, there were the Kalian’s Tears together with the Brent’s Ring.

Spat!

As he flowed mana into the Kalian’s Tears, the entire world became colored with a golden light.

Simultaneously, the flow of mana that twitched and moved inside Kali’s body was transparently seen almost as if he could grab them.

‘So he was using the mana in that way.’

Roan inwardly smiled and breathed in deeply.

The heat within his body rode his palms and flowed into the Travias Spear.

‘Left, right, center, up, middle.’

Using the Kalian’s Tears, Roan precisely grasped Kali’s flow of attack.

Spat. Pabat. Pat.

The fierce metallic sound disappeared and the sound of the air splitting filled its space.

“Oh!”

“Lo, look at that!”

The nearby soldiers pointed at Roan and Kali and shouted in awe.

Kali’s brilliant swordplay that stormed without a pause.

Although that too was great, the even greater thing was in fact Roan.

With a much too relaxed expression, Roan was dodging all of Kali’s strikes.

And that was without moving the warhorse and only by moving his waist and neck at that.

“Damn it!”

Kali spat out a curse.

More than twenty strikes consecutively cut and stabbed the empty air.

The wrist, elbow, and the shoulder numbly throbbed.

‘Was this bastard’s skills this much?’

His inside seethingly boiled.

Although it seemed that he could cut his neck even immediately, the reality was a succession of empty swings.

At that moment.

‘Right!’

Kali’s eyes flashed and shone with light.

The place his gaze reached was Roan’s left side.

Towards that side, one Owells Forces’ knight was approaching.

‘The bastard is absent from dodging my attacks. Quietly approach and just stab the bastard’s side!’

It wasn’t a situation to argue of being cowardly or not.

In the battlefield, winning was the most important, and surviving was second most important.

Finally, the Owells Forces’ knight reached near.

“Die!”

Together with a cold shout, he stabbed forwards with the longsword.

“Aah!”

“No!”

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers shouted with shocked expressions.

From anyone’s eyes, it was a fatal moment.

But Roan’s expression was in fact greatly relaxed.

Sssg.

Roan, who seemed to be only staring at Kali and only focusing on dodging Kali’s strikes, lightly twisted his waist and narrowly dodged the longsword of the Owells Forces’ knight.

Not only that, he directly kicked up his knee and bounced off the sword.

“Eh?!”

At the instant the knight who lost his sword looked at the sky with a dumbfound face.

Kali’s strike, which had been fiercely pressuring Roan, explosively struck the longsword that had bounced up.

Kkang!

A heavy metallic sound rang out.

The longsword directly snapped its direction and instead flew towards the Owells Forces’ knight.

“Eh?”

The knight, without even having quite dodged, merely blinked his eyes.

Ssskuk.

With a horrifying sound, the long blade pierced the knight’s face.

“Ah!”

“Just how……”

“How unlucky.”

The soldiers who had been watching exclaimed.

They thought that the series of situations was something that had happened coincidentally.

However, this was all a situation that Roan had created.

After having grasped the path of Kali’s strike in the very brief instant, he had bounced the longsword of the Owells Forces’ knight.

“Damn it!”

Kali spat out a curse with a completely twisted expression.

Roan coldly smiled and pointed at Kali with the tip of the spear.

“I should soon end this.”

“You, you son of a……”

Kali stuttered at his outrage.

Paying no mind, Roan lowered his body and swung the Travias spear.

Sssuug!

The spear extended in an instant.

The edge of the spear cut the bridge of Kali’s nose.

“Kuk!”

Kali quickly bent his neck and swung his sword.

Chang! Chajang! Chang!

The metallic sounds rang out again.

The Travias Spear repeated to lengthen, shorten, thicken, and become thin and agitated Kali’s eyes.

Spat!

Finally, the spear’s edge slashed Kali’s shoulder in a long line and passed by.

“Kuuk!”

Kali clenched his teeth and moved back.

But Roan wasn’t one to quietly watch this.

“Are you thinking of running away again?”

Spurring his horse, Roan stuck to Kali’s left side.

With a pressed expression, Kali swung his sword.

Chang!

Roan lightly blocked it with his spear and then stared straight at Kali’s eyes.

‘Did you think I would dodge!’

The last remaining pride.

Kali too stared straight at Roan’s eyes.

At that instant.

“Light.”

Roan’s lips lightly moved.

Simultaneously, two balls of light about the size of a fingernail appeared in front of, no, right in front of Kali’s eyes.

“Kuk!”

At the incredible pain that felt like his eyes would burn up, Kali instinctively ended up closing his eyes.

The sword that was pushing off the spear greatly shook.

Roan didn’t miss that instant.

Paat!

The spear danced a long line and split the air.

And finally.

Ssskuk.

The spearhead pierced Kali’s abdomen.

“Kuhuk!”

Swallowing empty air, Kali glared his eyes.

Simultaneously, he dragged his mana together and hardened his abdomen.

But that was a temporary measure.

His life would be cut off the instant Roan twisted and pulled the spear.

“Do, do you…… think, to a lowly bastard like, I’ll…… kuuk.”

Extending his sharply shaking hand, Kali grabbed Roan’s armor.

He wanted to at least grab his collar.

“A lowly bastard, is it……”

Roan pushed Kali’s hand away with the tip of his fingers and shook his head.

“There is neither a lowly nor precious man in the world.”

A cold voice.

The wrist holding the spear twisted bit by bit.

“There is only men.”

Roan tried to pull out his spear just like that.

Suddenly, Kali abruptly raised his hands.

“Wa, wait! Do, do you perhaps know what happened to my son?”

He was talking of Walter.

With a stiffly solidified face, Roan answered.

“He died.”

Of course, it was a lie.

No, even so, it also wasn’t a complete lie.

‘Since Kali’s son has died.’

The one who had survived was Roan’s knight Walter.

‘Kali. I cannot let you leave with a light and easy heart.’

He wanted Kali to greatly be tormented and lament his own wrong even on the other side.

Kali, as if he couldn’t believe it, shook his head.

“No, no way…… there’s no way that can be.”

Stuttering and trembling voice and hands.

Roan quietly stared at that sight, then directly pulled out his spear.

Sssuug!

Instantly, a large hole appeared on Kali’s abdomen.

The muscles and the veins he was laboriously holding with mana all loosened.

“Cough.”

Kali threw up a clump of blood and dropped his head.

A pathetic death.

Kali Owells, who, blinded by ambition, had thrown away even his family.

With a large hole opened on his abdomen, he lost his life on the battlefield.

Ssskuk!

The spear’s blade once again split the air and cut Kali’s neck.

Roan raised the Travias Spear up high.

“Roan Lancephil has cut the enemy commander Kali Owells’ neck!”

A giant voice rang out across the battlefield.

“Waaaaaah!”

“Roan! Roan!”

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers shouted and cheered, and pulled up their morales.

The Chase Legion and the Owells Forces’ soldiers, who were already being helplessly struck down, completely lost their spirits at Kali’s death.

“Pressure them!”

“Attack! Attack!”

The crimson legion’s commanders encouraged the soldiers and pushed the enemy army.

The perfect victory was in front of their nose.

At that moment, one soldier shouted aloud.

“Jonathan Chase is running away, sir!”

It was an urgent voice.

When Roan turned his head and looked, the sight of Jonathan, who was staying at the rear, leading the knights below and running away towards the main army’s camp was seen.

Austin hurriedly approached.

“I will chase him, sir!”

As expected, his look was a one of his spirit completely burning up.

It was a look of fretting that they might perhaps lose Jonathan.

However, Roan was instead of a greatly eased and composed expression.

He stared at the camp on the west and formed a faint smile.

“There is no particular need to chase him.”

Through the Kalian’s Tears, the faraway camp was seen largely as if it was right in front of his nose.

At the Chase Legion’s camp, a bright light was flashing.

“Are you saying we should just let him escape, sir?”

Austin tilted his head and asked.

Roan cheerfully smiled and answered shortly.

“On the west……”

A soft voice.

“The knight of light is there.”

Tie (3) End.

Chapter 184




T/N Update: ch. 185 will most likely be delayed to early wednesday. Currently cramming for psych midterm in approximately 14 hours.

‘It become completely crumpled.’

It was the last hope.

If Kali Owells was to just perhaps snap Roan, he could have flip the situation of the war.

Of course, he didn’t hold any big expectation.

‘If Kali was a man of that much degree, the situation wouldn’t even have became like this.’

Rather, he was able to run earlier than he thought because his expectation wasn’t big.

‘After returning to the camp and reorganizing, I should return to the fief.’

He thought to leave the main army’s soldiers as rear guards and hold back Roan’s ankle as much as possible until the fief war ended.

If lucky, he should be able to place at least a part of Lancephil fief’s west in his grasp.

At least not losing.

Now, the thing Jonathan Chase was looking at was merely that much.

Furthermore.

‘If the mercenary bastards I planted in the Mediasis Castle were to just capture Roan’s subordinates alive……’

He would be able to take the higher ground in the negotiation process afterwards in advance.

It meant that the situation hadn’t gotten to the very mess.

But.

‘Damn it.’

His heart feeling frustrated and his annoyance soaring up couldn’t be helped.

There were several chances where he could have captured the entire Lancephil Fief and end the fief war with a victory.

However, everything crumpled as Roan followed Io Lancephil’s back and entered the fief war.

‘Bitch like bastard. I will absolutely repay today’s humilia…..’

The curse that had filled up to below his chin couldn’t quite flow out of his mouth.

Jonathan Chase’s face stiffly solidified.

The main army’s camp.

At that place, an unknown flag was fluttering.

Vende Troop.

Jonathan instinctively pulled his horse’s reins.

His breath was caught and cold sweat flowed on his entire body.

“Vende Troop?”

A familiar looking troop name.

At that moment, a knight approached and answered in an urgent voice.

“I, it’s the troop of light, sir.”

At those words, the faces of the nearby knights were colored with a rotten light.

“By troop of light, you mean the bastards who were poking apart the western region?”

“Even though we couldn’t even find them when we tried to……”

Dazed voices.

Jonathan’s face comically twisted.

“Damn it! Are you telling me the main army’s camp has gone into the enemy force’s hand!?”

“I, it seems so, sir.”

The commanders stuttered and lowered their heads.

“Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!”

Jonathan spat out curses.

However, he couldn’t just keep being angry.

“We’re circumventing the camp! We are returning to our fief!”

The moment he gets captured, the fief war would end.

And with a complete loser’s look at that.

Jonathan kicked his horse and ran towards the right side, the camp’s north.

That was an extremely ideal as well as instinctive decision.

‘The south is Roan’s territory.’

Furthermore, the hills spread out towards the north were a greatly suitable region for throwing off the pursuit troops.

Dudududu!

The sounds of horse hooves noisily rang.

Thankfully, sign of a pursuit troop chasing from Roan, Tale Legion, nor the Lancephil legion couldn’t be seen.

It was a situation where they could safely return to the fief if they just dodge the Vende Troop well.

‘If I can just return, if I can just return……’

He could aim for the next chance.

‘I will set a proper plan not with Io but Roan as the opponent.’

Roan’s entering of the fief war was a part Jonathan too hadn’t predicted.

Because it was so, the laboriously set board had shook and the things had become tangled.

At the very least, Jonathan at least thought so.

Dududududu!

Together with a cloud of dust, Jonathan and the knight order entered into the space between the hills.

Suddenly.

Vvuuuu!

With the sound of horn, a heavy-armor troop appeared between the hills.

An infantry troop whose bulky weight could be felt from just looking.

The flag soaring at the lead strongly fluttered.

Vende Troop.

“Ah……”

The instant he checked the troop’s name, Jonathan let out a quiet exclamation.

The bastards who should be at the main army’s camp had appeared blocking the retreat path.

“Hahaha! Sir Count Jonathan Chase! You have moved as my prediction!”

The individual who loudly laughed as he stepped forwards was the Vende Troop’s troop commander as well as the one called the knight of light, Brian Miles.

‘Director Clay is truly incredible.’

Brian having shown up from between the hills was because there was Clay’s advice.

Clay had predicted Jonathan turning right towards the north and running away the instant he checked the main army’s camp having fallen.

‘Director Clay. Really, I absolutely don’t want to have him as an enemy.’

Brian made bitter smile and looked at Jonathan.

Jonathan’s face was brightly flushed.

Uddk.

Clenching his teeth, he slightly moved back.

There were no more different ways.

‘Piercing through.’

Thankfully, the Vende Troop’s number wasn’t very big.

It was because they had also left a number at the main army’s camp just in case.

“Pierce through. We must pierce through to live.”

Jonathan, as if to quietly recite, gave the order.

“Charge!”

Soon, the knight pulled out their swords and kicked their horses.

Risking one’s life. 1

An incredible pressure poured out.

“Cover the warhorses’ eyes!”

“Everyone prepare for light!”

They had fully heard and knew of the rumors about the knight of light and the troop of light.

The knights, tightly leaning on the horses’ backs, covered the horses’ eyes with one hand.

Simultaneously, they deeply worn the helmets.

From Brian and the Vende Troop’s position, it had became harder to save their enormously mighty advantage.

“Huhuhu.”

However, Brian instead quietly laughed and shook his head.

“Idiots. To think you’ll cover your eyes during a battle.”

At the same time as his words ending, he suddenly raised his right hand up high.

At that instant.

Paat!

From between the hills, a tight rope jumped up.

That also wasn’t just one or two but a number reaching as many as tens.

Puuk! Pubuk! Puuk!

The fiercely running warhorses got caught on the ropes and fell flat.

They couldn’t have dodged the ropes because both the knights and the horses were covering their eyes.

“Kuk!”

“Uak!”

“Kuuk!”

At the abrupt situation, the knights yelled out screams and rolled on the ground.

Amongst them, there were also ones who were crushed under the giant warhorses and directly passed away just like that.

“Uuuu.”

“I, I think my leg’s broken……”

Even the ones who had survived, most of them had broken their arms and legs.

They weren’t able to properly react because they had been covering their eyes.

Brian, who had been watching, pulled out his sword.

“We’re slaughtering the enemy forces. Charge!”

“Charge!”

With a horrifying order, the Vende Troop kicked off the ground.

Boom. Boom. Boom.

Each time they made a single step forwards, a heavy sound echoed out.

“Uuuu. Sa, save me!”

“Da, damn it!”

Knights begging to be left alive.

Knights swinging his sword to the end.

Like that, Jonathan’s knights, with all sorts of looks, lost their lives in ones and twos.

‘Is it ending like this?’

Jonathan sighed with a despondent look.

But he soon shook his head and clenched his teeth.

‘No, I can’t give up like this.’

Pulling his reins, he glared at Brian and the Vende Troop.

‘I’ll pierce through in an instant.’

They were heavy-armor troop.

If it was a normal situation, they shouldn’t be able to follow him, who was riding a warhorse.

Taat!

The warhorse kicked the ground and quickly ran between the hills.

If it went well, it felt as if he could pierce through the Vende Troop as wished.

But.

Paat!

Together with the sound of breaking through the air, Brian blocked the road in front of Jonathan.

“Where are you going?”

His face was grinning and brightly smiling.

“You, you son of a bitch!”

Jonathan pulled out the sword at his waist and kicked his horse.

‘Just this bastard, I need to pierce through just this bastard.’

Behind him, there was no bastard who stood and blocked his retreat path.

Strength went into the grasp holding the sword.

But that sight itself was greatly poor and unsightly.

Unlike Kali, who was an outstanding warrior, Jonathan was an archetypal scholar.

“How funny.”

Brian snickered and grabbed his helmet with his left hand.

Cluck.

The plate helmet came down and covered his two eyes.

Instantly.

Flash!

From the entire armor, a bright light poured out.

Jonathan and the warhorse, who had ran up close in order to cut down Brian, quickly turned their heads and tightly closed their eyes.

“Kuuk!”

Jonathan felt the warhorse he was riding unstably falling down.

‘I, I have to dodge!’

A situation where he could directly be crushed and die instantly if not careful.

With his eyes close, he wildly twisted his body.

Simultaneously with the feeling of flailing through the air, soon a strong impact was felt from his head.

“Gguuh.”

With a phlegm bubbling sound, Jonathan directly blacked out.

Looking at such Jonathan, Brian burst out an amazed laugh as if to say it was ridiculous.

“What? He came and crashed on his own and then got knocked out on his own?”

The place Jonathan’s head had crashed was in fact Brian’s body.

He had strongly crashed into the weighty heavy-armor.

Brian knocked his armor and formed a bright smile.

“Anyway, have we captured Count Jonathan Chase……”

That was to say.

“We won.”

Not only that, they had flipped the start’s disadvantageous state of the war and had grasped a complete victory.

Dudududududu.

From the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion that was far away, a group running towards him was seen.

The giant flag fluttering at the lead. )

Roan Lancephil.

Brian looked at the flag and breathed in deeply.

His chest needlessly shook and felt proud.

Towards Roan who still couldn’t be seen, he saluted.

“Vassal Brian Miles. I have fulfilled the order, sir.”

The powerful voice rode the western wind and flowed out.

*****

“Uuuu.”

His head ached.

A feeling as if the entire world was spinning even though he was closing his eyes.

‘Have I blacked out……?’

Jonathan tried to support his head with his hand.

But for some reason, his arms didn’t move as he wished.

At that moment.

“If you have slept that much, now wake up.”

A quiet and soft voice was heard.

A voice greatly familiar to the ears.

It was the voice he absolutely couldn’t forget.

‘Roan?’

Creasing his forehead, Jonathan forcefully opened his eyes.

A bright light pierced into his eyes.

Once he blinked his eyes several times, the surrounding scenery came into his eyes.

“Ah……”

Jonathan let out a quiet exclamation.

They were seen.

Roan and Roan’s retainers who were quietly looking down while surrounding him.

As if looking at a funny toy, they looked truly pleased.

Uddk.

Jonathan clenched his teeth.

An incredible humiliation.

The rage soared up to the top of his head.

However, he didn’t carelessly shout out.

‘For now, I need to get untied.’

In any case, it was a fief war the nobles inside the same kingdom had waged.

He shouldn’t be able to cut the neck of a noble, and a count at that, without permission.

“Roan. No, Co…unt Roan Lancephil.”

The words didn’t get attached very well.

No, honestly, he didn’t wish to call him like that.

But right now wasn’t the time to show off his pride.

“Certainly, your abilities are great. I lost this fief war. It’s my complete defeat.”

Jonathan, while making a declaration of defeat, made a smile.

An expression as if the things that had happened until now wasn’t that important.

“Hahaha. I’ll take my knights and soldiers and return to my fief. If you formally request a remuneration, I’ll recompense at the reasonable line.”

Jonathan forcefully bursted out a laugh.

He lightly shook the arms that were tightly tied.

“So untie this bind for now. You can’t treat the kingdom’s count like this.”

A voice quietly speaking as if to teach.

He innocently labored to pretend a relaxed look.

A look to show that the fief war’s end was originally like that.

But Roan and his retainers in fact didn’t show any reaction.

‘Jonathan Chase.’

Roan looked straight at Jonathan’s eyes.

He too was reading Jonathan’s intentions.

‘He probably thinks that I wouldn’t be able to kill him.’

It was something that couldn’t be helped.

Roan and Jonathan were Rinse Kingdom’s nobles, and counts, which were upper nobles, at that.

He couldn’t informally kill an upper noble even whose successor selection needed to receive the palace’s permission.

But.

‘If I leave him alive like this, he will become a big regret.’

It wasn’t a very far story.

It was certain that he would immediately perform all sorts of maneuvering saying he had broken the capital’s order with entering this fief war and so on.

And most of all.

‘I have no thought of ending the fief war like this.’

In the first place, Roan’s goal wasn’t regaining the Lancephil Fief.

‘I will seize even the Chase County.’

Roan bit his lips.

A situation where he couldn’t let him alive nor kill him.

But if he were to particularly choose, killing him was, as expected much more beneficial.

Kkwaddek.

He grasped the Travias Spear at his waist.

‘I can only report that he died an untimely death during battle.’

Although there would be those who would be suspicious, that too, he could only talk around as needed.

The light in Roan’s eyes changed.

He had finally made a decision.

“Um? Count Roan Lancephil. You perhaps……?”

Jonathan faintly creased his brows.

Although his level of martial skills was unsightly, him reading the mood at least was quick.

He instantly realized the killing intent flowing out of Roan’s eyes.

“I, I’m a kingdom’s count! If you kill me, other nobles and even the palace wouldn’t sit still!”

The voice urgently yelled.

Roan deeply inhaled and took out the Travias Spear.

Jonathan became even more impatient.

“You, you son of a bitch! I, if you kill me, you bastard too won’t be safe!”

It was an ignoble threat.

It couldn’t be helped if it was to live.

However, Roan paid no mind.

Chang!

Together with a metallic sound, the spearhead showed itself.

At that moment.

Spat! Pabat!

Together with a sharp sound of breaking through the air, swords and an arrow flew from Roan’s sides.

Pbuk! Pbuk!

Three swords and one set of arrow deeply pierce into Jonathan’s body.

“J, just what is this bitch like……”

At the abrupt situation, Jonathan glared his eyes.

His gaze moved following the sword and the arrow’s owners.

The owners of the swords and the arrow.

They were Austin, Semi, Brian, and Harrison.

“Gguuuk.”

As if saying he couldn’t admit death, Jonathan sharply trembled his entire body.

He glared at Roan, then slowly bent his neck.

It was a vain death.

It was the appalling last moment of a man who entertained a greed that did not fit his size.

Roan quietly stared at Jonathan, then exhaled a short sigh.

“All of you, what are you doing?”

At the shortly asked question, Austin answered in a composed voice.

“Count Chase’s words are right, my lord. If my lord was to cut Count Chase’s neck, numerous problems just can break out.”

Following that, Semi shrugged his shoulders and answered.

“I’m just because Count Chase was nasty.”

Brian too was of a greatly composed voice.

“There is no need for my lord to particularly step up.

“We’ll take care of work like this, sir.”

The lasts were Harrison’s words.

Roan alternatingly stared at the four people, then soon shook his head.

“You guys……”

Although he did not say much, he was inwardly satisfied and proud.

The subordinates he had roamed the battlefields together with had now became close enough to understand even his heart.

Roan put aside the Travias Spear he held and stared at the numerous commanders.

“The fief war hasn’t ended yet.”

It was a situation where there was still almost ten days left until the end date of the fief war the capital had decided.

Roan tightly clenched his fist.

“We are going to the Chase County.”

Words any longer that that were not needed.

The many commanders including Austin saluted and kneeled down on one knee.

“Yes sir! We will follow our lord.”

Voices loudly echoed out.

It was a sound that boiled up the men’s aspirations.

Roan slowly nodded his head and looked towards the west.

The vast hilly region came within one glance.

‘Let’s go until the end.’

The tips of his mouth softly went up.

The true steps began from now.

Like that, seven days had passed.

Boom!

The door of the Rinse Kingdom’s grand hall flew open.

The nobles who were sharing a chat inside the grand hall all looked towards the door.

At the mannerless act, everyone’s displeased looks were obvious.

At that moment, the knight who entered inside the door kneeled down on one knee and shouted in a loud voice.

“The Count Lancephil House and the Count Chase House’s fief war has ended, sir!”

The voice thunderously echoed the inside of the grand hall.

“What?! The fief war has ended?”

“Even though there’s still two days until the end date?”

Many nobles whispered with confounded expressions.

Especially the looks of nobles who supported Prince Simon Rinse were greatly dumbfound.

‘Has Roan Lancephil perhaps fallen?’

‘That he ultimately couldn’t protect the fief……’

‘Ah hah…… what should we do of this.’

In the first place, the state of the war at the time Roan entered was truly not great.

Because of that, the nobles who were supporting Simon having pessimistic thoughts was not unreasonable.

On the other hand, the expressions of the nobles who supported Tommy Rinse and Kallum Rinse were slightly elated.

‘Finally, even Prince Simon would slip greatly once.’

‘With this, the throne succession competition too would have its gaps greatly shrank.’

They were all looks of shaking their shoulders and barely holding back laughter.

At that moment, Viscount Tio Ruin, who was Simon’s right-hand man, opened his mouth with sorrowful expression.

“Yes, what had happened?”

At those words, few nobles snorted.

Their expressions were ones saying why would he ask something obvious.

But soon, their expressions ended up colored in a rotten hue.

The knight’s answer that followed was a completely unpredicted thing.

“Count Roan Lancephil chased out the Chase Legion from the Lancephil Fief and then instead attacked the Chase County……”

He raised his head and looked at the many nobles.

“And has completely captured the Chase County.”

The knight gulped his spit once, then shouted at the top of his throat.

“The victor of this fief war is Count Roan Lancephil!”

T/N: I’m really sorry about the recent delays, and I think you guys deserve an update on my current personal life related to translation speed. Currently, I’m rather ashamed to say that my grades have basically plummeted to a red zone, so I’ll have to spend less time translating and more on studying until my grades go back up. Essentially, that would mean 1 chapter a week released on weekends, when my schedule is more flexible. I sincerely apologize to you guys for this.

On that note, the next release will probably be one chapter on next Tuesday; afterwards, IatM will be released one chapter per week on weekends.

Chapter 185




The Rinse Kingdom’s capital, Miller, greatly shook from one rumor.

Count Roan Lancephil has won the fief war!

It was something unbelievable.

They were well aware that Roan’s abilities were great.

But even so, they hadn’t expect him to flip the fief war, whose balance had already tilted, and to take the victory, and a complete victory at that.

Because of that, few people even sent gazes of suspicion asking whether Roan already knew that the fief war would arise.

But because he was Roan, whose popularity amongst the Miller Castle’s residents were high, such suspicious gazes were soon unable to gain strength and disappeared.

“Is the sir going to be taking everything from the Lancephil County to even the Chase County?”

“Of course. That’s essentially the rule of our kingdom’s fief war.”

“Hoho. Then that would mean that the size of Sir Count Roan Lancephil’s fief is bigger than the four sir dukes?”

“Nah. Just the fief’s size is like that. The fief’s location is at a completely remote place.”

“Right. It is a place that’s all touching the border.”

The Miller’s residents were feverous talking about the stories of the meteoric upper noble of the kingdom, of the grand noble Roan who had even came to have a giant fief.

“Since the fief war has ended, the sir should soon come to Miller, right?”

“Right. He’ll enter the palace, report to his majesty the king, and officially receive the nobility.”

“Kuha. Awesome. Awesome. For him to start as a mere spearman and become a count of the kingdom.”

Several young men raised up their thumbs.

At that moment, one old man crinkled his nose and asked.

“Anyhow, where has Sir Io Lancephil gone? Even though his successor Sir Count Roan Lancephil has done a grand work like this……”

Already, various rumors concerning Io Lancephil, who had suddenly dropped out of sight, were circling amongst the castle’s residents.

From stories about retirement to exile, to even stories about death and assassination.

Various speculations were circling around, but there was no one who knew of the true story hidden behind the veils.

“Wouldn’t the sir soon show up once Sir Count Roan Lancephil return? But more than that……”

One young man trivially answered, then changed the topic.

“Would the other nobles including the four sir dukes stay quiet?”

They were the ones who had rejected and rejected repeatedly even when the mere commoner became a baron.

There was no way that they would quietly leave and watch Roan, who was reborn into a grand noble in an instant.

At those word, the old man who had taken out the story about Io just before clicked his tongue and shook his head.

“The four dukes and the other nobles? The real problem isn’t them.”

At those word, everyone swallowed dried spit and nodded their head.

They more or less grasped what the old man was going to talk about.

The old man, with a rather serious expression, spoke as if to whisper.

“The senate. That shadows may come out of the shades.” 1

“Hhmm.”

Many people, with groans, nodded their heads.

The Rinse Kingdom senate.

A group made up of old nobles who had served at least three kings.

Though the number of affiliated nobles were very small, the power they had couldn’t be ignored even so.

Although they were far away from the actual political power half out of their own will and half out of others’, the existences that could cause an enormous influence at any time were the very nobles of the senate.

Even though no problems had arisen until now because they were so very ancient beings with no particular design in the worldly affairs, the Rinse Kingdom might already have been shredded apart had they intruded into the throne succession competition.

“If the senate were to hook and trip over Sir Count Roan Lancephil……”

“If it’s his majesty the king now, he may make the investment of nobility itself something that never happened.”

With serious expressions, an even more serious story went around.

At that moment, youngest man amongst those listening creased his brows.

“Even if they are the senate, would they openly show hostility, sir?”

Numerous people nodded their heads at those words.

They were reasonable words.

In the first place, they were ones who stayed far away from politics because they had no interest in the worldly affairs.

There was no reason for them to suddenly place a snag.

Furthermore, there was the thing called the people’s eyes.

Currently, Roan was, in the Rinse Kingdom and especially amongst the commoners at that, no different than a hero.

Press down and oppress that Roan?

Even from the senate’s position, it definitely wasn’t an easy thing to take on.

At those words, the old man who was leading the conversation murmured in a small voice together with a short sigh.

“Who knows of that too? Old men like me are naturally fickle.”

But because the voice was so small, there was no one who heard those words.

The people heatedly focus again on stories about Roan.

And together as one, they all wished that he would quickly enter the capital, Miller.

Ordinary commoners so passionately awaiting a noble like so was an extremely rare thing.

*****

“Director Clay. What is it about, sir?”

Captain of the Mediasis Guard Pichio, in lieu of the numerous people, asked in a cautious voice.

Clay, who inspected the letter a messenger bird had brought just before, cheerily smiled and answered.

“It’s an order telling a group of retainers including me and captain Pichio to enter the capital, Miller, sir.”

The letter was something Roan had sent.

“Ah……”

Pichio let out a quiet exclamation.

Capital, Miller.

To Pichio, who was of Istel Kingdom’s border gate guard origin, Miller was a story about a far faraway world.

He even thought that it was a place that he wouldn’t have any need to go in his entire life.

‘Is this also thanks to my lord?’

Pichio inhaled deeply.

For some reason, his heart raced.

His respect for Roan newly gushed up.

Suddenly.

“Am I perhaps also included in the list of names entering the capital?”

The one who asked in a quiet voice was Tenebra Troop’s troop captain, Keep.

Clay, with an expression saying it was obvious, nodded his head.

“Commander Keep is someone who raised the biggest achievement in this fief war. Of course you are included in the list, sir.”

At those words, Keep shook his head.

“Then please pass on to the lord that I cannot go to Miller.”

“Eh? You won’t go to the capital, sir?”

Clay, with a slightly surprised look, asked back.

Keep readily nodded his head.

“Thanks to the actions of us, the Tenebra Troop’s members, we were able to shut down Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild’s riot in advance. Afterwards, we have locked up the ones who were problematic and have newly built the Rinse Eastern Mercenary Guild with the rest of the mercenaries.”

“Yes. I know of that well, sir.”

Clay slowly nodded his head.

At the instant Roan and Count Jonathan Chase was waging a ferocious battle at the Lancephil Fief’s West, a battle that wasn’t quite a battle also unfolded in the Mediasis Castle.

The Rinse Southern Mercenary Guild’s executives, who had been infiltrated by Jonathan’s order, had tried to capture Roan’s retainers including Clay to make them hostages.

Thankfully, Clay and Keep, who knew of this from long ago, attempted an attack first together with the Tenebra Troop’s members whom they had infiltrated in the mercenary guild, and were soon able to completely capture the entire guild.

It was a swift action that no one had predicted.

“I now plan to raise the newly started Rinse Eastern Mercenary Guild to be the kingdom’s greatest mercenary guild.”

“Even so, to enter Miller is essentially to meet his majesty the king, sir. It’s a highly honorable and precious plac……”

As Clay continued on long words to persuade him, Keep once again shook his head.

“Rather than such a place, the future of my lord and the fief is much more important to me, sir.”

“Hhm.”

With a quiet groan, Clay nodded his head.

“That thought thinking of our lord, that truly is like the troop commander of the Tenebra Troop, sir.”

Tenebra Troop.

Like the meaning of the shadow troop, Keep had already become Roan’s shadow.

“If my name is perhaps also on the list, I too wish to focus on the work I have received, sir.”

“I’m also the same. Now isn’t the time to leisurely go on an outing to the capital. I’ll have to look for things to do for the lord and the fief, sir.”

Following behind, the core retainers spoke on words similar to Keep’s.

It was an unexpected event.

To the kingdom’s citizens, entering the palace and meeting the king was an incredible honor.

‘But even so, they’ll refuse that honor for the lord?’

Clay made a slightly surprised expression.

At that moment, Pichio, who was watching the situation, faintly smiled and looked at Clay.

“Director Clay. I……”

“Will Captain Pichio also stay behind here?”

Clay cut his words first and asked.

Pichio lightly nodded his head.

“Yes. If I leave my seat, a hole could be pierced in the public order of the Mediasis Castle where the lord’s castle is. As the situation is as so, I should focus on the mission I took.”

Although the fief war had ended, the group that were following Jonathan and the group who betrayed the Count Lancephil House together with Kali were still spread throughout the entire fief and acting in secret.

If they were to become drunk in victory and loosen their guard, the possibility of receiving a large harm instead was high.

‘It’s regrettable, but I should do the more important thing.’

Pichio tightly clenched his teeth.

Rather than one’s own honor, he had chosen the path for Roan and the fief.

Clay looked around at Pichio, Keep, and the so and inwardly exhaled a short sigh.

‘Everyone’s loyalties are incredible.’

He, even while greatly marveling at them, somehow felt a fearful feeling.

Roan’s abilities like might and insight were parts Clay too greatly recognized.

His humane appeal too was plenty.

Since it was to a point where he would personally pull up his sleeves and step up for the residents of the slum.

But bringing out this much of an unconditional loyalty was something almost impossible with only such reasons.

‘It may be that the lord’s biggest strength and secret weapon isn’t spearmanship or strategies, but……’

Clay’s eyes flashed and shone a light.

‘These people.’

Whether geniuses or common people, the people around Roan followed and respected Roan with sincerity.

That strength, which had gathered little by little like that, had developed before anyone noticed to the point where even the powerful noble houses couldn’t ignore.

‘My heart feels a bit complicated.’

Clay inwardly made a bitter smile.

He still wasn’t able to clearly look into his own heart.

*****

“Uhehehehe.”

Poutingly showing off his four canines, Gank burst out a bizarre laugh.

Marrak, who was sitting on a giant cart and tilting a cup, clicked his tongue as if to say he was pathetic.

“What’s so good for you to laugh about?”

His voice was slightly mixed with annoyance.

Tactlessly, Gank kept on bursting out the bizarre laughter.

“Uhehehe. Since we really got an incredible food without a single battle, it can’t be helped feeling good.”

As soon as his words ended, Marrack clicked his tongue with a displeased look.

“Tch tch tch. It’s because you’re like that that we hear them calling orcs stupid.”

His voice was cold.

At this point, even Gank realized that the mood was unusual.

He murmured with a slightly quailed voice.

“Even though the one who set up this work was the tribe head……”

Furthermore, the work was perfectly wrapped up as Marrak and Chris first planned.

Gank couldn’t understand why Marrak was annoyed, no, angry.

Marrak put down the cup he held and raised his right hand.

The slowly moving cart stopped.

Following suit, the orc warriors that were following behind also stopped their feet.

Marrak looked straight at Gank and asked in a low voice.

“You brat. The moment you met that human bastard called Roan, what kind of thought did you have?”

“Roan? Ah, you mean that guy called Chris’ master?”

“Yeah. I’m talking of that fief war’s victor and the count bastard of the Rinse Kingdom.”

Marrak slowly nodded his head.

Gank thought for a moment, then sulkily pouted his thick lips.

“Just that he looked manly? A feeling like he was really bold? Well even so, he’s just a human brat.”

“Huu……”

Marrak exhaled a long sigh.

Forcefully swallowing the roar that climbed up all the way to his throat, he shook his head.

“Gank. Listen clearly. This time, I planned to expand our territory into the Rinse Kingdom’s northern region if chanced while working with the bastard called Chris. It wasn’t immediately, of course, but……”

Marrak lightly tapped a pointedly jutted-out canine with the tip of finger and continued on.

“I had plenty of confidence to do so. It was a plan to make the human bastards lower their guards and then swing around as I wish. But……”

The light in his eyes sharply shone.

“The moment I met Roan, I felt that something was wrong.”

“Just wha, what……?”

The inside of Gank’s head was still dark.

Marrak exhaled a short sigh.

“Roan. That bastard was a much greater bastard than I had thought. I could tell the moment I met him. That gaze that seemed like it was plainly piercing through and seeing even my inside, that incredible pressure pouring out from his body, that soft yet powerful august that makes even the heart kneel……”

The tightly clenched fist sharply trembled.

“Looking at him lightly was a complete misjudgment.”

Marrak’s face nastily creased.

The moment he first learned of Roan’s existence was when the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom invaded the Rinse Kingdom.

At that time, Roan commanded Chris and made a request asking to attack the Byron Kingdom’s rear and provisions storage.

A human making a request to an orc.

It was an unprecedented event and something hard to believe easily.

Because of that, Marrak thought that Roan was a lousy human.

Although he exclaimed at Chris’ boldness and talent, he had judged Roan as a contemptible brat.

Because of that, he thought that, as long as he wheedled him well, he could swallow him in a single bite whenever he wanted.

Marrak thought that Roan was on top of his own palm.

But.

‘The one who was on a palm was me.’

The one who was played around with was himself.

Marrak simply harassed the Byron Kingdom’s rear according to Roan’s desire, and he had merely intimidated Jonathan’s rear according to Roan’s wish.

Marrak looked at Gank.

“Gank. Perhaps, we may have attached wings to a tiger.”

HIs voice was as heavy and subdued as his expression.

However, Bank was still blankly blinking his eyes.

Marrak laborious smiled and opened his chest.

Even if he regretted now, it was futile.

Inherently, orcs had the temperament of doing whatever he resolved once regardless of what happened.

‘If I planned to cheerfully swing around, then I should swing around.’

They couldn’t keep on living a life of being kicked around here and there and running away.

There was a need to show the humans the orcs’ strength.

“Well, if a wing’s attached to a tiger, that’s a moron, a moron.”

There was nothing to fear.

Marrak tightly clenched his fist.

Humans versus orcs.

Like that, the prelude of that war was being born.

*****

The capital, Miller, was full of a blazing heat like a furnace.

It was because the news of Roan’s entrance to the capital had finally been delivered.

Beautiful floral decorations took place on the broad street that continued from the north gate to the palace and an incredible crowd swarmed up to its surroundings.

It wasn’t the welcoming ceremony of Baron Roan Tale’s entrance to the castle.

It was the welcoming ceremony of the kingdom’s upper as well as grand noble, Count Roan Lancephil’s entrance to the palace.

The frame was different than the entrance ceremony and triumphal celebration.

An incredible size and brilliance.

The difference between a count and a baron was greater than that of the sky and the earth.

“Here he comes!”

“It’s Sir Count Lancephil!”

The crowd at the street pointed at the north gate and shouted.

“Waaaah!”

“Roan Lancephil! Roan Lancephil!”

An incredible cheer exploded out.

But.

“Ah……”

“That’s……”

The Miller’s residents all widened their eyes and closed their mouths.

The cheer disappeared as if washed away.

Everyone’s expressions were half dazed.

They, watching the sight of the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion entering inside the castle gate with Roan at the lead, swallowed dry spit.

A crimson legion.

The crimson legion who they only heard of in the rumors were there.

The sight of crimson everything from the helmets to the armors and even wearing crimson capes.

Furthermore, the cavalry set crimson armor on the horses’ heads and the infantries each wrapped crimson ribbon on their weapons.

“It’s the crimson legion…… they’re the crimson legion!”

Someone shouted at the top of their throat.

The cheer, which for an instant had vanished, explosively burst out as if it had been waiting.

“Waaaaaah!”

“Crimson Legion! Crimson Legion!”

An incredible heat.

Roan, at the cheers that poured down from every direction, made a smile.

Below the helmet, a pleased expression floated up.

‘It’s good I listened to Brian’s words.’

Originally, the ones who equipped crimson armors were only the Tale Legion who participated in the Poskein Subjugation.

It was because they were able to use Sethus’ blood.

The Lancephil Legion, which had joined later, were wearing armors with various colors.

Thanks to that, the Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion looked like a completely different legions.

Brian Miles, seeing that sight, opined a suggestion asking of dyeing even the armors of Lancephil Legion’s soldiers.

Even without that, Roan was known as the crimson ghost, or the crimson war god, and Roan’s legion was known as the crimson legion.

It was an opinion that only Lancephil Legion equipping various colored armors amongst these wasn’t right.

Roan, because they were reasonable words, immediately gave the order and made every soldier’s armor be turned crimson.

Although there was no particular effect besides that it was red since it wasn’t dyed with the Sethus’ blood, he was able to raise the sense of belonging and loyalty of the Lancephil Legion’s soldiers just by dyeing them.

Furthermore even the legion itself’s splendor became much greater.

A crimson legion.

It was because the crimson wave became more fierce and grand.

“Oh! Count Roan Lancephil!”

When they walked between the welcoming crowd and arrived in front of the palace, the First Prince Simon Rinse raised his arms and fussed about.

He was of an honestly happy look.

“You are truly a surprising man.”

Now, even Simon did not carelessly treat him informally.

He had began to receive Roan as a count of the kingdom.

“Although I would like to immediately raise a glass of drink right now, his majesty the king is waiting.”

Simon shook his head as if regrettable and stepped aside.

“Let us speak again after greeting his majesty.”

“Yes. Prince Simon.”

Roan shortly answered and slowly moved his feet.

The surrounding nobles’ gazes stingingly poured down.

Admiration, awe, envy, rage, annoyance……

Each were showing all kinds of emotions without alteration.

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

‘From a certain view, they really are sincere and pure people.’

The lot called the nobles were truly honest to their feelings.

‘The sly ones are, as expected, just the four dukes, marquises, and counts……’

As expected, they were more adept at hiding their emotions the higher their nobilities were.

They were all showing forced smiles towards Roan.

‘You all should prepare yourselves well, sirs.’

Roan lightly rolled and clenched his fist.

They would all think that the fief war had ended.

However, the true fierce war began from now.

‘Since war isn’t only hitting and fighting with just swords, blade, spears and shields.’

Roan, with the things he earned as the basis, intended to jump to an even higher place.

“Oh! Count Roan Lancephil!”

When they entered into the grand hall, King Deni Von Rinse raised his two hands and welcomed him.

“I greet his majesty the king.”

Roan walked up in front of the throne and then kneeled down on one knee.

“I have heard well of your achievements.”

For a while, Deni III praised Roan’s abilities and hard work.

Even he, who had no interest in politics, had faintly taken an interest in Roan, who over the few years had consistently shown prominence.

A chatter without an end continued on.

In the end, Duke Francis Wilson, who couldn’t put up with it no more, slightly creased his brows and glanced sharply.

“Hhm.”

Deni III instinctively noticed Francis’ cold gaze.

Smiling awkwardly, he let out a cough.

“Hm. Hm. It seems I got too excited that I spoke a bit long.”

Deni III gently looked at Roan, who was still kneeling on one knee.

“Before officially being granted the nobility, do you perhaps have something you wish of me as a count of the kingdom?”

It was merely a formal question.

But Roan, who already had something thought up, raised his head as if he had been waiting.

“Yes. This small vassal, has a small wish, your majesty.”

“Hhm?”

Deni III made a slightly surprised expression.

That, for the three princes including Simon and the other nobles, were also the same.

They hadn’t know that he would possibly answer that he wished for something to a question asked in formality.

Francis came to his senses first, then slightly nodded his head.

Seeing that sight, Deni III asked in a quiet voice.

“What is that wish?”

At those words, Roan answered in a soft but powerful voice.

“Please recognize……”

His eyes flashed and shone a light.

“The things I have earned as my own.”

Daring words.

In short, it meant to not covet his things.

Including the four dukes, the complexions of the upper nobles stiffly solidified.

‘We got done in.’

‘We lost the lead.’

As a matter of fact, they had planned to opine to Deni III and reduce his fief’s size or take away the soldiers he had gathered as he wished.

Many nobles’ eyes quickly moved.

Roan, inwardly smiling, spoke once again with a bold manner and voice.

“My things are my own.”

Whether that was fief, soldiers, resources, or talents.

No, at the very least, even the things beyond that.

Of course, he didn’t carelessly spit out the last words.

Now wasn’t the time.

But even with just the statement right now, there was plenty of possibility of it becoming a cause of problem.

Sure enough, Second Prince Tommy Rinse, who had been staying quiet, instantly shouted and roared.

“You! Rinse Kingdom is that of his majesty the king! Nowhere is there any of yours! Whether fiefs, fiefs’ citizens, resources, or soldiers. You are merely borrowing them from his majesty the king for a moment!”

The roar echoed the grand hall.

Few nobles nodded their heads and concurred.

At that moment, Roan turned his head and looked at Tommy.

The light in his eyes were still bold.

He faintly smiled and spoke in a quiet voice.

“Prince Tommy. Please watch your words.”

“Wha, what?!”

Tommy, making shocked rabbit eyes, stuttered his words. 2

Roan cheerfully smiled and added on as if to declare.

“I am a count of the Rinse Kingdom.”

T/N: Sorry about this chapter being late. I’m not too sure why this year is so hectic compared to the last year, but both Kuhaku and I are being grilled by our schoolworks and are having trouble even trying to match our time to work together on the chapters. On that note, this chapter is brought to you by Pyrenose, who stepped in to help proofread the chapter in place of Kuhaku, who was unavailable at the moment.

Hopefully and based on our new schedule, the next chapter will be up this weekend by Kuhaku and me.

Chapter 186




T/N Update: Sorry. The next chapter will take a rather long while. I recently found out that all of my mid term exams happen on the same week, with at least 3 of them on the same day. Right now really isn’t the time for me to translate, but I’ll get back as soon as possible with multi-chapter release. The earliest I can guarantee is next week’s Sunday, and the latest being the start of the US Thanksgiving Weekend.

The soft voice filled the grand hall.

Simultaneously, a silence descended.

Tommy became enraged.

“Y, y, you……”

However, he couldn’t carelessly spit out the curse that had climbed up to his throat.

Roan’s words were the truth.

The upper nobles of count and above were not existences that the princes, who had no special peerage or formal titles, could treat without care.

Roan once again looked at King Deni Von Rinse.

A bold yet not an unmannerly attitude on any account.

Faintly smiling, he lowered his head.

“Your majesty, it seems that there was a slight misunderstanding at my words. My words did not dare ask for your majesty’s possessions, but meant to request that your majesty to execute every affair as according to the palace and the kingdom’s laws.”

In short, it meant to give him every authority concerning the Chase County as according to the Rinse Kingdom’s rule of fief wars.

Roan, with his head still lowered, added on.

“Please uphold the customs of the law, set the principles straight, and become the model of every man.”

Although it was enveloped well and then said, the words contained the meaning that, if he were to perhaps have other thoughts, he did not have the qualification of a king.

Deni III panicked.

“R, right. Since the thing called the law is there to be upheld.”

Words spat out in bewilderment.

At Roan’s attitude and pressure, he had unknowingly been swept along.

“Hhm.”

Frustrated groans flowed out between numerous nobles.

There were weights even on the words.

Even if the words were the same, their weight differed depending on whose words they were.

Although words of Roan, a count, was also heavy enough for Prince Tommy to carelessly go against, the words of Deni III, who was the king, was much heavier than that.

In bewilderment or not, the words the king spat out once had a life of its own.

‘Oh damn.’

Deni III became shocked a step late and closed his mouth.

The inside of his head rapidly spun around.

Although he wanted to redress the situation a moment later, there was no suitable method.

The man whose name was called a king couldn’t flip over the words he had spat out once without any excuse.

Deni III’s eyes naturally turned towards Duke Francis Wilson.

“Huu.”

With a short sigh, Francis shook his head.

Meaning that he too did not have any appropriate method.

He could had flipped the words pretending to remonstrate if he had made a misstatement instead, but what kind of remonstration could he give to the words saying he will follow the law.

Ultimately, they could only do as Roan desired for now.

Roan too was clearly assessing that mood.

“I simply weep in gratitude at your majesty’s virtue.”

The words altogether hammered in the nails.

Deni III awkwardly smiled and nodded his head.

‘Looks like I’ll get scolded by Francis.’

Cold sweat flowed down his back.

Originally, he had planned to withdraw half of the Chase County that Roan had captured and also reduce the number of soldiers he had indecorously gathered to a suitable number.

Although the Lancephil County and the Chase County were located in a remote place, it was because their size was simply so big.

If not careful, he could grant too much strength to a mere noble.

For this, Deni III matched his mouth with Francis multiple times and had rehearsed.

The practices weren’t bad.

Deni III, and Francis too, all anticipated a positive result.

It was because they had thought that the other nobles would flock like a swarm of bees and respond once he provided the tune.

But.

‘To think we’ll lose the initiative like this.’

He couldn’t even take out the words they had prepared.

The inside of his mouth felt bitter.

Inwardly, Deni III and numerous nobles exhaled a short sigh.

‘We can only aim for another chance.’

‘It’s regrettable, but there are still many more chances remaining.’

It was already spilled water.

Rather than thinking of gathering it up, pouring a new cup was more effective.

The upper nobles, including the four dukes, forcefully made smiles.

They were smiles meaning that they will let it as he wished.

“Then, I will start the nobility ceremony.”

The Grand Chamberlain, Viscount Logan Dayle’s voice rang the grand hall.

Roan’s nobility ceremony was brilliant.

At the place where every core nobles of the Rinse Kingdom were gathered, the title of Count Lancephil was granted together with a new house crest.

Together with that, he was invested with the original Lancephil County and even the Chase County.

Finally, Roan had officially become the noble with the most extensive fief in the Rinse Kingdom.

That was not all.

Although everyone had forgotten due to having no particular interest, Roan had the Poskein Lake, whose width was comparable to the Rinse Kingdom.

When looking just at the extent of the area Roan’s breath touched, it could be said to be of a kingdom scale.

‘It would have been good if those guys came too.’

Looking at the numerous crests, badges, and medals that hung following his chest and belt, Roan thought of the retainers who stayed in the Mediasis Castle.

Keep, Pichio, and such core retainers voluntarily declined entering the palace this time.

‘Since they said that they will do their best at the duty they received……’

A situation where it was difficult to particularly rebuke them.

Furthermore, the surprising thing was.

‘Even Clay, whose ambition is incredible, has stayed behind at Mediasis Castle.’

He had predicted that at least Clay, even alone, would enter the capital, Miller.

But he too had sent a letter saying that he will devote himself to the duties he took as the administrator responsible for the fief’s governance.

‘He really is someone unpredictable.’

Roan inwardly formed a bitter smile.

Anyhow, the nobility ceremony ended faster than expected thanks to the core retainers of the Count Lancephil House being absent.

‘I will make sure that there is not a single bit of the retainers’ merit rewards lacking.’

Regardless of their status, regardless of their disposition, he planned to hold a fair and prudent merit awards based only on achievements.

When his thoughts inside his head reached that point.

“Now! Should we go to the banquet hall?”

As soon as the complicated and boring nobility ceremony ended, Deni III kicked off the throne and stood up.

Although he did momentarily show a political look, as expected, the look befitting him was a light look like that.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The The Grand Chamberlain, Viscount Logan Dayle, knocked on the marble floor three times with a large staff.

Deni III quickly adjourned.

Simultaneously, First Prince Simon Rinse and the nobles supporting him went towards Roan.

In reverse, Second Prince Tommy Rinse and Third Prince Kallum Rinse, with stiffly solidified expressions, led numerous nobles and exited out of the grand hall.

“Count Lancephil. You’ve done well. You have truly done well.”

Simon held Roan’s two shoulders.

He was admirable. Praiseworthy. And.

‘Trustworthy.’

Although there were many close forces around him, there was no one as reliable as Roan.

‘I definitely have to make him my man.’

No, to be exact, there was a need to tightly tie him up so that he can’t leave his side.

‘I’ll use Io Lancephil.’

Roan thought precious of the people near him, and especially of Io Lancephil.

‘So that he can never betray me, I’ll capture Io Lancephil as a hostage.’

A horrendous thought.

This was the point where Simon and Roan were greatly different.

If Roan made the people around him awe and remain near on their own, Simon worried of betrayal and treachery in advance and preferred somewhat oppressive and violent methods.

Of course, it wasn’t as if Simon had no other methods as one would expect.

‘Although there is one more method……’

His eyes flashed and shone a light.

From a certain point of view, it was a more stable and certain method.

A truly classical method.

‘If he were to simply marry my sister……’

If they became tangled not as strangers but as a family, he would be much more relaxed than now.

‘Katy needs to do well.’

Simon thought to connect his sister of the same mother, Katy with Roan.

Of course, this was entirely and only Simon’s thought.

‘I should watch for now.’

Simon invited Katy to the congratulatory banquet.

Since Katy originally liked places with many people, she wouldn’t refuse and definitely attend.

“Now, let us head to the banquet hall as well.”

Simon raised his hand towards Roan and the numerous nobles, then moved his steps at the lead.

He obstinately walked side by side with Roan, and the nobles who were watching that sight from the back each sank into various thoughts.

‘Although I admit that Count Lancephil has repeatedly raised many merits……’

‘Isn’t he favoring him too much……’

‘Like this, we will all end up getting out of his sight.’

Few nobles, with uneasy and restless light in their eyes, exhaled short sighs.

The prince they support becoming the next king was a greatly glorious and happy thing.

But if that king actually does nothing for them?

Could they continue feeling glorious and happy even at that time?

‘Although making Prince Simon the next generation’s king is also important, the more important thing is after that.’

‘I need to be promised a higher nobility or office.’

‘Even if Prince Simon climbs up to the kingship, what use is it if I were to go out of his sight.’

Right now, it did not exceed merely a small anxiety.

But the possibility of this anxiety soon becoming a giant schism was high.

An excessive favoring of one person was the cause.

Simon, who feared and guarded against betrayal and treachery so much, was in fact creating the spark of strife.

And that……

‘As expected……’

Was also something Roan had expected.

*****

She awaited.

She awaited the news and awaited to meet again.

‘I don’t know if he too was like that, but……’

Her heart, for once, raced after a long time.

Her face kept getting colored red.

“Greg. Do you think I can also attend the banquet?”

At the anxious heart, she kept throwing the same question.

Guardian knight Greg Katis, who was walking a step ahead, faintly smiled and nodded his head.

“Of course, your highness.”

A voice filled with certainty.

It was a reliable voice.

Even though he had to give the same answer to the same question countless times, there wasn’t even a little bit of an annoyed look.

Her heart slightly relaxed only then.

“Huu.”

Squeezing through her small lips, a long sigh flowed out.

Her face was still brightly colored.

Looking elated, looking anxious, the lady moving her steps towards the banquet hall was Princess Aily Rinse.

She, who was called the shadow princess, had heard the news that congratulatory banquet for Roan’s nobility ceremony was opening and had shown up.

“Eh? Just now……?”

“Shadow Princess?”

“Right?”

Aily’s appearance was something shocking even to the numerous nobles and knights.

The nearby people began to whisper.

At that moment.

‘Ah……’

Aily let out a quiet exclamation.

She could see him.

At a place close enough to touch with just six, seven steps, Roan was there.

However, she couldn’t move any further.

‘Katy.’

At Roan’s side was Katy.

A sister of a different mother and Simon’s sister of the same mother.

Roan and Katy, the two people looked truly cheerful and happy.

The gazes and laughter pouring towards each other.

Aily unknowingly stepped back.

The noise of people whispering slowly became bigger.

Naturally, the gazes of the people inside the banquet hall headed towards Aily.

Amongst them, even Roan’s gaze was there.

‘Ah……’

Aily once again stiffly froze like a stone.

The gaze that was smiling towards Katy pierced into her own eyes.

The sound of her heart echoed in her ears.

At that moment, Greg walked up and, in a small voice, spoke as if to whisper.

“It’s okay. Princess. You don’t need to hide anymore.”

A voice of support.

Greg was certain.

That Roan too was of the same feeling as Aily.

“But……”

Aily, without being able to do this or that, dropped her head.

Suddenly.

“Princess.”

From right in front of her nose, the voice she missed so much was heard.

Very slowly, Aily raised her head.

“Sir Count Lancephil.”

The end of her voice slightly trembled.

‘Idiot.’

She felt so like an idiot.

“Princess. It has been a while.”

Roan, together with a faint smile, slightly lowered his head.

The political stages where one couldn’t lower his guard even a second, the world of nobles where veiled strifes wildly danced, battlefields where heads flew off with a slightest mistake.

He was Roan, who at all times lived in a taut tension.

But right this moment, upon his life, at least on this moment facing Aily, he solely concentrated only on her.

“Congratulations.”

Aily shyly smiled and slightly lowered his head.

Roan wordlessly made and showed a smile.

‘Why do I feel so good?’

From his head to the tip of his feet, a warm and soft happiness twined around.

[Hey! What’s up with your face?]

Abruptly, Kinis showed up together with a sharp voice.

She, who was momentarily taking a rest due to repeated battles, had felt change in Roan’s emotion and had shown herself.

‘What did I do?’

Roan curtly asked inside his head.

His gaze was still looking at Aily and his face too had no single change.

Since Kinis wasn’t visible to other people, he thought that only he had to be careful.

Kinis, flying between Roan and Aily this way and that, made an odd expression.

[Just with a glance, you right now look amazingly ha……]

When her words reached about that point.

“Is this little lady a water spirit?”

With a casual expression, Aily asked as if to whisper.

Instantly, Roan and Kinis both widely opened their eyes and looked at Aily.

Both were of looks solidly petrified like ice.

“Ca, can you see her, your highness?” [You, you can see me?]

Both stuttered their words as if greatly shocked.

At that sight, Aily hid her mouth with one hand and snickered out a laugh.

Then as if embarrassed, she soon blushed her face.

“I’m sorry. It’s just, both of your faces were so funny that……”

Aily slightly lowered her head.

Roan quickly shook his hands.

“No. There’s really no need to apologize. It’s simply that you’re the first person to see Kinis……”

“I see.”

Aily nodded her head and looked at Kinis.

Kinis, with her arms crossed, was making a haughty expression in her own way.

[You. How can you see me?]

‘What do you mean you? What kind of manner is that to the princess?’

Roan slightly creased his brows and chided her.

But even while doing so, he plentily watched the nearby people’s gazes and put up a guard.

[What about it. She’s princess only to you guys, and merely a human girl to me.]

Kinis poutingly retorted.

Aily faintly smiled and nodded her head.

“Kinis’ words are right. Nice to meet you. My name is Aily.”

Conscious of the nearby people, she naturally greeted her as if speaking to Roan.

[Un? Uh, yeah. Right. My name’s Kinis.]

Kinis, who purposely tried to show a mean and cold look, slightly flustered when Aily approached modesty and politely first.

‘Even though I heard that all the human world’s princesses’ noses are so high that you can’t even joke about them……’

Remembering the rumors she heard in the past, Kinis tilted her head.

Perhaps finding that Kinis cute, Aily quietly stared at her, then turned her gaze towards Roan again.

“Hmm.”

Seemingly contemplating for a moment, she tapped her lips with the tip of her finger.

‘Yes. If it’s Sir Count Lancephil……’

She wanted to share the stories that she had tightly hidden.

Aily gently looked at Roan and smiled.

“Since you introduced a cute friend to me, I’ll also introduce my friends to you.”

A very quiet voice that seemed conscious of the people nearby.

“A cute friend?”

Rather, Roan focused on a strange point.

Kinis, who was flying above his head, hit the backside of Roan’s head.

[She’s talking about me. Me!]

A truly humorous sight.

Roan, slightly creasing his brows, glared at Kinis and then soon looked at Aily.

“I’m not sure where in this girl is a cute friend, but…… for now, I’m looking forwards to meeting princess’ friends. Since they do say that friends are similar to each other.”

Slightly showing intent.

In inwardly, it was true that he found it a little doubtful.

‘Princess Aily’s friends……’

Like the rumor of Shadow Princess, Aily took almost no trip outside and there also were almost no royalties or nobles whom she was close to.

Even if there were, most of them were impersonal relationships.

At least, it was so according to what Roan knew.

‘But to suddenly say she’ll introduce her friends……’

At that moment, Aily shyly smiled and lightly waved her right hand.

“You can look forward to it.”

Suddenly, four small drops floated up between Roan and Aily.

They slowly became bigger and soon turned about a fist big, but their each colors were distinctly different.

“Un?”

Roan, at the abnormal phenomenon unfolding in front of his eyes, widely opened his eyes.

[This is?]

Kinis too, as expected, was similarly shocked.

Roan hurriedly looked around himself.

Everyone looked greatly calm and unperturbed.

Even the nobles who were staring at Roan showed no particular reaction.

‘So only Kinis, Princess Aily, and I can see them.’

Roan quickly understood the situation and stared at the four drops again.

The shape of the drops soon twisted, then slowly took on a human look.

No, to be exact, it was a look greatly alike Kinis.

“Spirits?”

Roan murmured in daze.

Aily bashfully smiled and nodded her head.

“Yes. That’s right.”

A much too incredible an answer compared to the much too calm attitude.

She looked at the red spirit at the left.

“This here is fire spirit Lili.”

Following that, her gaze moved on towards the other spirits.

“This is earth spirit Soyl. This is wind spirit Brist. And this is……”

Lastly, Aily looked at the blue spirit.

At that moment, Kinis, who had been staying quiet, cut in.

[Water Spirit Ateil.]

Then the blue spirit, Ateil, lightly waved her hand.

[Hello. Been a while. Kinis.]

A sweet voice.

It was a truly happy look.

However, Kinis did not acknowledge he any further.

No, she couldn’t.

Her entire focus headed towards Aily.

That was also the same for Roan.

Roan and Kinis’ expressions were half dazed.

For one person to contract with four spirits each with different types!

Obviously, he had never seen such a person or learned of one through rumor.

Even.

‘It’s something that didn’t happen even in the last life.’

Roan inwardly shook his head.

It was literally an unprecedented event.

Roan and Kinis looked at Aily and, in a hushed voice, asked.

“Princess. Just what is your identity?”

[You. Who are you?]

Aily, while moved the spirits in front of her eyes to her back, smiled.

A beautiful and alluring and sweet and innocent smile.

Her small lips softly moved.

“It might be a little long story. I……”

Chapter 187




Her voice was slightly elated.

This was the first time Aily Rinse told her secret to someone other than her nanny Margaret or her Guardian Knight Greg.

No, she didn’t have any thought of saying it until now.

“In the past years, I actually……”

The moment her words reached that point.

“Count Lancephil.”

Together with a familiar voice, Simon Rinse suddenly came up.

[Eit!]

Kinis crumpled her face with a deflated look.

[What an unhelpful bastard.]

She grumbled with a sharp voice.

‘You’re right.’

Roan bitterly smiled and looked behind him.

He could see Simon and Princess Katy Rinse.

‘She got forcibly dragged in.’

Looking at Katy’s somewhat uncomfortable looking face, Roan formed a bitter smile.

As according to Simon’s plan, he had conversed for quite a long time with Katy since the banquet started.

As a result, the thing he learned for sure was just one.

‘Princess Katy and I are complete opposites, complete opposites.’

Unlike the calm Roan, Katy was excessively lively.

To say how much it was.

‘It’s to a point where I’m suspicious of how Princess Katy, who is lively enough to a give someone a headache, and Pierce, whose words are excessively few, lived happily in marriage.’

Roan newly found Pierce amazing.

It was to that degree.

Katy’s tomboy personality, that was.

“What were you doing here?”

Simon lightly smiled and looked back and forth between Roan and Aily.

A soft shape of the eyes and mouth.

But from the eyes hidden inside, a sharp pressure flashed.

‘Why with Aily instead of Katy……’

Simon couldn’t understand.

Aily was a royalty who was inconspicuous even inside the palace enough to be called the shadow princess.

She had no reliable backer nor prominent ability.

She even had no brothers or sisters.

To Roan, who was rising as a pillar of the kingdom and a hero, she was an existence that simply was of no help.

‘Compared to her, Katy is the only blood-relative of mine, who is closest to the next king’s throne.’

Her beauty too didn’t falter wherever she was placed.

‘Her personality is a bit wild, of course, but that’s something she could slowly fix.’

Even when looked from various angles, the girl that suited Roan wasn’t Aily but Katy.

‘Regrettable.’

Roan had guessed Simon’s such intention.

‘He is doing even love with his head.’

Simon saw even love as a part of political power.

Throughout the last life and the current life, the love of those close to power were almost all alike simon.

To them, love and marriage was no more than a method to maintain power.

‘I don’t live like that.’

Roan, who from the start had begun at the very bottom, was a man who knew how to love not with his head but with his heart.

Beyond numerous relations of gains and losses, he tried to be honest with his own feelings.

And.

‘My heart is……’

He clearly knew when, and in front of who, his heart beated more happily.

Although he had vaguely realized, he became more certain through today’s banquet.

Roan softly smiled and slightly lowered his head.

“I was talking with Princess Aily, your highness.”

“Hhm. I didn’t know that you were acquainted with Aily.”

Simon’s gaze headed towards Aily.

Constantly from the start, Aily was floating a faint smile.

Her deep eyes gently wrapped Simon’s gaze.

‘Older brother.’

She knew Simon’s intentions much better than Roan.

It wasn’t simply because they were step siblings.

‘It’s thanks to the mind’s eyes.’

Aily’s eyes weren’t ordinary.

The reason she could pierce through and see people’s hearts and thoughts.

Mind’s eyes.

The weight of the secrets Aily had was much heavier than anyone though.

‘Look at this girl……’

A conspicuous light frosted up in Simon’s eyes.

He hadn’t possibly expect that Aily, who was known as the shadow princess and who he hadn’t even minded until now, would calmly look back at his gaze that even the aged nobles dodged.

‘Have I made too hasty of a judgment……’

Within the palace, no, amongst the royalty to be exact, he thought that the only ones he had to check were Second Prince Tommy Rinse and Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

Besides them, he had demoted away or detained all those who could become a problem.

As an exception, he had simply left alone those he thought wouldn’t even be an opponent, and Aily was also one of those people.

But today, he thought that that decision might have been a mistake.

‘I should pay a bit more attention.’

The situation where he was far ahead in the throne succession competition.

Especially at the time like this, he had to be careful of even a single leaf, and then be careful again.

Carelessness was a taboo.

Simon deeply inhaled and looked at Roan and Aily.

‘If the two people were to possibly have favorable feelings towards each other……’

It wasn’t quite a pleasant situation.

He couldn’t clearly grasp what kind of thoughts Aily had towards himself.

‘There is no way it’ll be good……’

Even so, he could roughly guess.

Essentially in Simon’s case, those other than the faction supporting him were all enemies.

This was because he awfully liked to discriminate his men and those of others and also thought importance of it.

Simon’s gaze naturally headed towards Katy.

‘Are you going to just stay quiet like that?’

His eyes sharply glared.

But Katy wasn’t an existence who would move as Simon’s will like the other nobles.

He was Simon’s sole blood relative and sister.

One of the sole existence who could raise her voice against him.

Furthermore.

‘I don’t want to marry Count Roan Lancephil!’

Katy too didn’t quite like Roan.

Creasing her brows, she glared at Simon.

A soundless rebellion.

A soundless chiding.

A fierce staring contest unfolded between the two people.

Ultimately, Katy, who had no patience nor cared of other’s gazes, snorted first.

“Hmph! This banquet isn’t fun!”

Then widely fluttering her dress skirt, she went out of the banquet hall.

“Katy!”

Simon called out in a loud voice, but Katy didn’t look back even once.

‘Damn it.’

A curse raced to the top of his throat.

He wanted to immediately follow and reprimand her.

But.

‘If it continues like this, Count Lancephil and Aily will……’

His gaze naturally headed towards Roan and Aily.

The two people were standing side by side and staring at him.

That look seemed almost like a couple of many years, or perhaps a married couple.

‘It’s dangerous.’

Simon became restless.

But even so, to keep standing there was also humiliating.

No, he couldn’t even keep standing there.

Roan and Aily’s mood wasn’t something he could cut in by himself.

Furthermore, it wasn’t quite natural either.

“It seems something had happened.”

Simon awkwardly smiled towards Roan, then lightly waved his hand.

“I should go follow my sister.”

Roan and Aily lowered their heads instead of answering.

With a bitter expression, Simon moved his feet following Katy.

‘Damn it. Somehow, it feels like I’ll greatly regret this.’

His heart felt frustrated.

He felt that a day he would regret not separating Roan and Aily ahead of time would come.

Such apprehensive feelings always had high accuracy.

‘I can’t let it happen like that.’

Elements of danger had to be removed in advance.

‘I should investigate Aily.’

If cornered, he could simply use her as hostage.

‘Count Roan Lancephil. You must always be at my side.’

If he were to show a sign of leaving his side or betraying him.

‘Even I do not know how I will change at that time.’

His eyes flashed with a horrifying light.

Staring at Simon’s back that was getting further away, Roan and Aily, the two people made bitter smiles.

Then.

[Now! Should we continue what we were talking about?]

Kinis hastened Aily with a completely flushed face.

She couldn’t endure any longer.

Her face and her eyes were full of question marks.

Roan and Aily.

The two people looked at each other and silently laughed.

Their gazes were gentle and smiles warm.

[Oi. Are you really going to keep doing this?]

Kinis cut in with a sulky expression.

At those words, Aily shyly laughed and asked in a small voice.

“Should we change the location?”

Her gaze headed towards a small balcony located at one side of the banquet hall.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“I will lead the way, your highness.”

He moved his feet a step ahead.

Aily followed behind.

Naturally, the people’s gazes poured down.

‘Why is Count Lancephil and the Shadow Princess?’

‘How did the two get acquainted?’

‘Just what is happening this time?’

Numerous royalties and nobles busily spun their heads.

‘It’s hard to get close to Count Lancephil, but……’

‘Should I try approaching Princess Aily’s side?’

This was the moment that Aily, who lived without any presence as a shadow, slowly began to receive people’s attention.

“We wouldn’t get interrupted by anyone if it’s here.”

Aily whispered as she gazed at the beauteous scenery spreading outside the balcony.

A sweet voice.

Roan faintly smiled and nodded his head.

He quietly awaited her next words.

Cheerfully smiling, Aily continued to speak.

“You know that my nickname is the Shadow Princess, yes?”

“Yes. I know, your highness.”

Roan lightly nodded his head.

Aily turned her head and looked straight at Roan.

‘Hhm.’

The moment Roan saw her wide and deep eyes, he swallowed a quiet sigh.

His heart raced.

Aily’s small and red lips slowly moved.

“The reason I’m called the Shadow Princess is because I caught an illness few years ago and haven’t went outside for quite a long time.”

Roan quietly nodded his head.

It was a fact he also knew well of.

Aily brightly smiled and shook her head.

“But that’s a mistaken rumor. I……”

The sweet voice brushed past his ears like a wind.

“Have never gotten sick.”

“Hmm.”

Roan let out a quiet sigh.

But even so, he wasn’t greatly surprised.

He had already thought that the possibility of the rumor about Aily being wrong was high.

This was because the news concerning various medical treatment concerning her were nonexistent despite having caught an illness and being house arrested.

‘As expected, there was a different reason.’

This much was easily within the expected range.

But Aily’s stories that continued beyond this point were things that far, far exceeded Roan’s expected range.

“For a long time, I studied various things outside the palace.”

Already unusual stories.

Roan and Kinis slightly creased their brows.

[Study? Why study all of a sudden?]

“Study, your highness?”

A tremble appeared in Roan’s composed voice.

Faintly smiling, Aily nodded her head.

“I lived with four teachers at a place deep in the Grain Mountains.”

It was unbelievable.

A young princess living outside the palace, and in the most precarious of precarious lands where not even the knights carelessly enter, the depth of the Grain Mountains at that was something absurdly unbelievable.

However, Aily’s expression was extremely serious.

There was not a single bit of lie in her eyes.

“I learned many things from the teachers. Learning the basic studies goes without saying, and I also learned magic and spirit magic. Being able to make contracts with four different types of spirits is also all thanks to the teachers’ teachings.”

The instant she finished her words.

[Ridiculous! That’s a lie!]

Kinis shouted with a disbelieving face.

Although Roan did not also spoke out, he was of a similar feeling.

Kinis’ words continued on.

[You’ve made contracts with four different types of spirits thanks to the teachers’ teachings? Even if the teachers were elves, that’s something absolutely impossible. Maybe if those four teachers were dragons or spirit kings, but…… even so, it’s certainly not something easy. You’ll need four different types of affiniti……]

When her words reached that point, Aily brightly smiled and took out a gigantic secret that she had buried deep within her chest.

“You’re right.”

[Un? What’s right?]

At Aily’s sudden words, Kinis made a weird expression.

Aily slightly tilted her head to a side.

A cute look.

“My teachers were all……”

Instinctively, her voice became a little quieter.

“Dragons.”

Momentarily, a heavy stillness fell.

With their eyes wide open, Roan and Kinis slightly opened their mouths.

Until now, Roan and Kinis had experienced countless numbers of unbelievable events and also heard countless numbers of stories.

In Kinis’ case, she became a Spirit King candidate despite her insignificant origin.

In Roan’s case, he had came back to the past the moment he died and was living a new life once more.

Even just this much were unbelievable things.

But even so, the grand secret Aily revealed was shocking to be almost unprocessable.

Dragons.

The absolute existences that had already hidden themselves tens and hundreds of years ago.

The humans thought that they had turned their backs to the world and left for a world further away.

They didn’t think that they had all died.

For they believed that the dragons would never die.

To such a degree, the existence of dragons were almost of the same rank as the gods to the humans.

“P, princess is a pupil of not just one, but four dragons?”

The end of Roan’s voice shook.

Even he, who was famous to be normally calm and composed, couldn’t easily maintain his composure at this moment.

‘Dragons!’

Even in the last life, he had never seen nor heard rumors of their appearance.

“Yes. That’s correct.”

On the other hand, Aily was notably calm.

Rather, she seemed greatly relieved perhaps because of having revealed the grand secret she had kept secret.

Roan quietly stared at Aily’s eyes.

‘Dragon’s pupil…… why did such an individual not stand out in the last life?’

The thoughts within his head became disordered.

‘Did her life perhaps became completely changed as I came back to the past?’

His throat violently trembled.

At that moment, Kinis, perhaps understanding Roan’s tangled heart, asked with a voice full of suspicion.

[You’re a dragons’ pupil? That’s even more hard to believe in its own way, you know? A woman who’s a dragons’ pupil is imperceptibly wasting away her life while being called a shadow princess?]

At those words, Aily lightly shook her head.

“That’s only a part of my appearance. I am doing numerous works in my own way.”

[What work?]

Kinis snappily questioned.

Aily, without hesitation, answered.

For there was nothing more to hide.

“Various companies, including the Sale Trading……”

The moment her words reached that point.

“The Sale Company!?”

Roan, in a loud voice, asked back.

At an unthinkable situation, he heard a name he hadn’t even thought of.

Looking at Roan’s completely shocked face, Aily nodded her head.

“That’s correct. The Sale Company that’s investing in transportation in Sir Count’s fief is in fact one of the companies I run. I’m sorry about not revealing my identity sooner. I was worried that you might feel pressured……”

She was misunderstanding the reason Roan was being surprised.

Roan, still with a slightly dazed expression, stared at Aily.

‘Gold Master Sale who was hidden behind a veil. So his, no, her identity was Princess Aily.’

The head of the giant company that controlled 70% of the Rinse Kingdom’s trade.

The tycoon who was amongst the top five even throughout the entire continent.

This was the moment when Goldmaster Sale’s identity was finally revealed.

It was certainly a shocking and surprising event.

‘But……’

Roan quickly collected his thoughts.

A corner of his heart felt uneasy.

‘Goldmaster was certainly amazing, but……’

For an achievement a dragons’ pupil had achieved, it was somewhat disappointing.

Even in the last life, there were quite a large number of people who were more incredible than Goldmaster Sale when looked around the entire continent.

To such degree, there were many personages in the Great Warring Era.

‘Perhaps, does she have another different identity as well?’

When his thought reached about that point.

[You manage a company? Hmph. That can’t be all, is it?]

Kinis asked in a sharp voice.

She inwardly suspected something.

‘You contracted with four types of spirits because you’re a dragons’ pupil? That’s something impossible with just that. However amazing an existence dragons are, it’s something only possible with one’s own abilities also supporting her.’

She had to have an incredible affinity with each of the four different types.

An impossibility if one was an ordinary human.

A gaze of suspicion.

Kinis looked straight at Aily.

Aily, still with a smile, answered.

“Kinis’ words are correct. Besides the names Aily and Sale, I have another name.”

She, looking back and forth between Roan and Kinis, spoked in a quiet voice as if to whisper.

“Piscis. That is my other name.”

Instantly.

“Ah……”

Roan quietly exclaimed.

He could only be shocked.

‘Piscis……’

A lightning stormed within his head.

The Great Warring Era.

The grand column that held up that era of chaos.

And the name that supported that column.

Piscis.

‘The Queen of the Elves.’

Her name had abruptly appeared.

KCDS’s note

Hello guys,

CSV is back but due to personal issues (study, life issues, etc.), he will probably be able to release 1 chapter every 2 weeks at most.

Let’s all pray things get better for CSV as well.

Chapter 188




T/N: Hello, CSV here. I truly and most sincerely apologize for going into such a long hiatus. Between by college stats class and exhaustion from translating, I ended up falling apart last winter and couldn’t get back on track with translating until now.

But I’m finally back to translating IatM, and I promise for sure this time to make up all 16 chapters I missed during my absence since the first week of November.

So here are the first 6 of the missed chapters (ch.188~193), and the other 10 chapters (193~203) will be released throughout next week (+/- 2 days depending on editing speed).

The Great Warring Era.

The period when the entire continent fell into chaos.

An era of war whose beginning and even its cause were so intricately connected to a point of comprehension being impossible.

Especially the reason that the era of the Great War was exceedingly chaotic was that it wasn’t merely the human’s war.

A period when the oppressed, or perhaps disappeared, or perhaps even forgotten existences all raised their swords and blades.

Elves too, who were one of the disappeared existences, acted a pivot of the the era.

And the queen who led those elves.

Piscis.

She was the singular and strongest elf who showed off shocking archery, magic, and spirit magic that rivaled her emerald hair, ivory skin, and beautiful looks.

‘That Piscis is Princess Aily?’

Roan couldn’t believe her.

The appearances of Piscis he heard through rumors and Aily were simply too different.

At that moment.

[You’re Piscis? Don’t make me laugh. Maybe on dim-witted humans, but that kind of lie doesn’t work on me who’s a spirit.]

Seemingly slightly angry, Kinis pouted her lips.

Roan and Aily’s eyes turned towards her.

Kinis looked straight at Aily’s eyes.

[Piscis. That’s not just a name. That’s one kind of title signifying the elves’ leader and the supreme commander.]

Her voice slowly rose.

[It’s a sacred title granted only to those who has passed numerous tests even amongst the elves.]

Kinis flew round and round around Aily.

[You’re a human however I look. And you say that you’re the elves’ supreme commander? Say something that makes sense.]

Her voice held a sharp pressure.

Roan quietly stared at Aily.

He was awaiting her answer.

Aily’s expression was still calm.

Floating a faint smile, she answered in a soft voice.

“Kinis. You know about the elves’ world very well perhaps because you’re a spirit. Then, you can recognize this too, right?”

Aily fully opened her two hands, then pressing the thumbs and forefingers together, she made a small triangle.

Suddenly.

Paat.

Three small leaves with perfect symmetries floated up between her eyebrows.

Sublime leaves gently shining with a green light.

[Tezion……?!]

Kinis muttered with a dazed expression.

Tezion.

A term indicating the green emblem made up of three leaves, it was the ensignia and symbol of the elves’ supreme commander Piscis.

[You, you are really Piscis?!]

Kinis asked with a trembling voice.

Aily lightly nodded her head and parted the fingers she held together.

Simultaneously, the gently shining Tezion also disappeared.

[How could a human become Piscis?]

Kinis asked with a still trembling voice.

Roan also had a curious expression.

With a small voice, Aily answered whisperingly.

“I’m not a human. I’m a half elf.”

Half elf.

It was a term indicating a part elf born between an elf and another race.

Roan, who had been listening quietly, cut in with a cautious voice.

“Then do you mean that the deceased 4th queen was an elf, your highness?”

“Yes. My mother was an elf.”

Aily cheerfully smiled and nodded her head.

It was unbelievable.

Roan hesitated for a moment, then asked with a cautious manner and voice.

“But I heard that her highness the 4th queen Silen was a human with an ordinary looks……”

It was definitely recorded so in the in the archive of royalties he had learned of while accessing the palace library.

No, there was no one who wasn’t a human amongst the Rinse Royalty in the first place.

Aily answered in a calm voice.

“No. Mother was definitely an elf. And she was also her generation’s Piscis. She was merely living after having changed her looks with the dragons’ magic. And I’m of a human appearance instead of an elf’s because I’m still young.”

Originally, elves’ lifespan was much longer than that of the humans.

Because so, there were many cases of elves’ appearance showing up only after jumping well into the twenties in human years in the case of half elves born between elves and humans.

“That’s a shocking story. Does his majesty the king know of this truth?”

“No. My father the king only knows of my mother as an ordinary human. Since mother kept it as a secret to the end. The reason for that was…… uum. I can’t tell you this because it’s too personal a matter. I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay, your highness.”

Roan quickly shook his head.

After cleaning up the complicated thoughts inside his head, he threw a question once more.

“What was the reason her highness the 4th queen hid her looks even while using the dragons’ magic?”

He couldn’t help but ask.

The reason that the elves’ supreme commander hid her identity and lived while hiding amongst the humans.

Aily’s expression that had floated a soft smile until now slightly became darker.

“That…… was to not die and survive.”

A sad light shaded her voice.

“Mother was being chased.”

“What do you mean chased?”

Questions that he doesn’t wish but keep ending up asking.

It was something that couldn’t be helped to clearly grasped the surrounding situations.

Furthermore, the story that the elves’ leader lived in hiding in order to maintain her life was an incredibly shocking story.

Aily, looking out at the beautiful scenery that spread outside the balcony, exhaled a short sigh.

“This will be a very long story.”

Roan and Kinis, with their lips tightly closed, nodded their heads.

They were ready to lean their ears however much at her story.

“Where should I begin…… umm.”

Aily pondered for a moment, then took out a completely unexpected story.

“Yes. I should start from the dragons’ story.”

Roan, Aily, and Kinis’s gazes crossed.

“Dragons haven’t all died or left far away.”

The dragons that suddenly disappeared.

It was the moment the hidden truth was finally being revealed.

“They are currently at a place deep inside the Grain Mountains.”

A strength went into Aily’s voice.

The stories that followed were truly shocking and fantastical stories.

*****

“Why did only you guys came? What about the master bastard?”

A dark secret room.

Beyond the swaying candlelight, Duke Bradley Webster’s creased face was seen.

The young man who was standing politely on the opposite lowered his head.

“Apologies, sir. Master had an important work, so……”

“An important work?”

Bradley’s face exaggeratedly twisted.

“Is it a work even more important than answering my call?”

A sharp voice.

The young man did not panic.

“How can that be, sir? But he had left his seat empty from quite early on, so contacting him wasn’t easy, sir.”

Once again, he bent his back and bowed.

“We visited by ourselves since it seemed to be an urgent matter, sir.”

“Hhm. Lynce. That wily tongue of yours is still the same.”

Bradley wasn’t of a satisfied expression, but he didn’t let out any more words criticizing them.

But Viscount Hensley Forset, who was Bradley’s right hand man and of belligerent personality, had no thoughts of simply stepping back.

“Tch. Arrogant bitches. They should be throwing everything aside and running here when Sir Duke calls. There’s just nothing that’s satisfying about them. This is why hexers bastards get sweared at.”

A bucketful of swears poured down.

“I can only apologize, sir.”

Lynce bowed towards Hensley.

The young men who were standing at his sides were also the same.

Their faces were full of servile smiles.

Looks of having completely shrank at the violent words and swears.

They were the very existences the continent’s entire ruling classes including the royalties and nobles disgusted at, the hexers.

The beings who had hid their traces due to extensive subjugation had received Bradley’s order and had covertly came to the capital, Miller.

“That much is enough.”

Bradley, who had been staying quiet, waved his hand as if annoyed.

He didn’t particularly want to play around with the hexers.

He too used the hexers as his secret move, but he had no plans of intentionally staying close with them.

‘It’s uncomfortable when I’m with them.’

Bradley signalled with his chins at Hensley.

Hensley slightly lowered his head, then took out a thick bundle of papers from within his clothes.

“It’s this time’s target.”

A heavy voice.

The hexers received the paper bundle and carefully perused its contents.

“Hmm.”

Lynce creased his brows.

Although the paper bundle was thick, it was completely full of one person’s story and information.

“Why? Is it impossible?”

Bradley asked with a cold voice.

Lynce, soon smiling cheerily, shook his head.

“Of course not. There is no work impossible for us, sir.”

His expression changed oddly.

“Haven’t you already checked multiple times, sir?”

“Don’t smile slyly.”

Bradley cut his words with a chilly face, then once again waved his hand.

“Good. I will trust and leave it to you again this time. Roan. I will hand you a large reward if you churn up the inside of that bastard’s head.

At those words, Lynce and the rest of the hexers readily bowed at their backs.

“Oooh. Thank you so much, sir. Since you have already and even secured us a route to trespass the mansion he’s staying, we will take care of it within the next few days. Huhuhu.”

A disturbing laugher flowed out.

Lynce once again looked at the bundle of papers.

Large words were written at the top.

Roan Lancephil.

The Rinse Kingdom’s rising hero and the idol of the kingdom’s citizens.

The mission this time was to poke apart the inside of Roan’s head into a mess then turning him into an empty doll by placing a powerful hypnosis.

“Please leave it to us, sir.”

Lynce answered with a bold and confident voice, then walked out backwards.

The other hexers were also the same.

They receded back to a corner of the secret room where the candlelight didn’t touch, then soon disappeared.

Hensley, who had been watching, shook his head with a revolted look.

“Disgusting bastards……”

At those words, Bradley smiled oddly and shook his hand.

“Don’t be like that too much. Since even the bitches of dogs can face a tiger depending on how they are used.”

Of course, the even greater appeal was.

‘I can also mercilessly throw them away if it goes wrong.’

Since there are plenty of sons of bitches in the world.

*****

Shock. Shock. Shock.

It literally was a series of shocks.

Roan, who had returned to his mansion after the banquet had ended, sat alone in his office and sank deep into thoughts.

[Were you surprised a lot?]

Kinis asked with a slightly playful expression.

Roan gave no answer.

[Well, since even I was surprised.]

Kinis sat down on top of Roan’s knee and exhaled a long sigh.

[To think that the dragons are actually hibernating in the Grain Mountains. Just what kind of event has happened?]

“That we can’t know. Since even Princess Aily said she doesn’t know of that.”

Roan let out a short sigh.

[Anyhow, to think a bad blood rose up between the elves due to dragons hibernating…… that too is a shocking thing by itself.]

Roan quietly nodded his head at Kinis’s words.

The existences that overlooked the world’s balance, the dragons.

Their absence had fell the world’s balance little by little.

That was also the same for the elves who were the symbol of harmony.

They too lost their balance and had fallen from the inside little by little.

‘Elves and the dark elves’ animosity.’

During the time when the dragons overlooked the balance of the world, the dark elves called themselves shadows.

Being satisfied with their role, they formed a harmonious balance with the elves.

But after the dragons had disappeared, they were no longer satisfied by their role of shadows.

‘The dark elves aimed for her highness Silen who was the elves’ leader at the time.’

Thankfully, Silen was able to escape the dark elves’ trick and safely run away.

‘And she then became the 4th queen and hid into the Rinse Palace.’

Even the dark elves hadn’t thought that Silen might possibly hid into the Rinse Palace.

It was because the humans and the elves were no different than sworn enemies after the Great War that took place five hundred years ago.

The 4th Queen Silen, who had changed her looks with the dragons’ magic, married the current king Deni Von Rinse and gave birth to Aily.

‘Although she had afterwards asked the dragons who haven’t went into hibernation to push away the dark elves, they refused her request. According to what Princess Aily heard from her highness the queen, she said that it seemed almost as if they couldn’t leave the Grain Mountains.’

Grain Mountains and the Dragons’ hibernation.

There definitely must had been some sort of reason.

Afterwards, Silen recovered her original looks the year Aily became ten years old and returned to the elves’ forest.

She had intentionally became a target to protect Aily’s life from the dark elves who were continuing to chase after her back.

Afterwards, Aily became a pupil of the dragons that were the last to enter hibernation, went into the elves’ forest the year she became an adult, and obtained the title of Piscis.

Of course, she tightly kept the fact that Aily and Piscis were the same person a secret in order to fool the dark elves’ eyes.

Furthermore, she did not carelessly showed off her abilities in preparation against various events that might happen and abstained from going outside.

This was the very reason that she had continuously came to be called the shadow princess.

‘This too is questionable. For them to take Princess Aily as their pupil even though they actually refused the request to push away the dark elves……’

He could hardly understand the dragons’ actions.

“Huu.”

The thoughts inside of his head was chaotic.

There was one more thing that bothered his heart.

‘The dragons’ absence. If the world’s order and balance is falling down little by little because of that……’

And if that caused an influence powerful enough for even the elves who were the symbol of harmony to arose bad blood……

‘Aren’t other species including humans also in danger?’

Then.

‘The reason that the Great Warring Era opened up wasn’t simply because of humans’ greed but because of the dragons’ absence……?’

His heart felt frustrated.

“Huu.”

A long sigh kept flowing out.

[Roan. You don’t need to worry so much like that. It’ll be okay if we help Aily from now on.]

Kinis’s consolation.

She didn’t know what Roan was contemplating and feeling frustrated because of.

Roan tapped his lower lips with the end of his forefinger and delved into a deep thought.

‘Just what could it be? Just what had happened that all the dragons have went into hibernation?’

There was no way that the dragons didn’t knew that the world’s balance would be shaken if they all went into hibernation.

‘Then that means that they could only go into hibernation even while knowing that, but……’

A cold sweat flowed behind his back.

An instinctive reaction.

‘There’s still too many things that I do not know of.’

Even though he was living a second life, there were much more things that he didn’t knew than the ones he knew.

‘Come to think of it, I don’t even know how the Great Warring Era actually came to an end.’

A bitter smile hung.

It was regrettable.

He died much too quickly than he had thought in the last life.

But even so, he couldn’t just leave his hands off.

Since he came to know a new truth, a reorganization was needed once again.

‘For now, I should organize the things that will happen from now on.’

The best method he could do right now was to organize the future.

There was a need to calmly organize and draw a slightly bigger picture.

After this day, Roan abstained from going out as much as possible and organized the events that would happen from now on, no, the events that had happened.

And the day it became the fourth day he had sat down inside his office.

“Damn it.”

Roan creased his forehead.

He grasped his hair with both hands.

“To think I was this dumb.”

With a thick bundle of papers in front of him, Roan spat out a long sigh.

On the bundle of papers made by even attaching a leather cover, the numerous events that would happen from now on were tightly written down.

From a glance, it was an incredibly vast content.

But in reality, its content was excessively lopsided.

Majority of the content was stories about battles and wars.

Even that were all Roan had personally experienced or studied.

“Even though there definitely must be many this and that things I’ve heard and experienced……”

He had cleanly forgotten the subjects he hadn’t usually given much attention to.

‘Like this, it can’t be of much help.’

He might be able to lead the lost battles to victory using the contents he had organized just now, but it was almost impossible to draw a big picture using just that.

“Damn it.”

Curses flowed out.

Knocking his own head, he stood up from his seat.

“It would be nice if I could look inside my head……”

Saying nonsense, he stretched.

Because he had squeezed out the future’s events for days, there wasn’t a time he went outside his office.

‘I should just cool my head.’

Roan quietly moved his steps and went out of the office.

A thick darkness had set in his surroundings.

‘Is it a twilight?’

Even his sense of time was faint.

Passing through the corridor of grand mansion he was momentarily staying at, he headed towards the splendid and large garden located at the back yard.

“My lord.”

Few knights and soldiers who were standing sentry duty discovered Roan and saluted.

Roan called them away because he wanted to spend the time alone, then moved his steps towards a place deep inside the garden.

‘How nice.’

The cool night air cleanly cooled his heart and head.

‘Yeah. Let’s relaxed for a little bit.’

It was certain for even things that are possible to become ruined if one unnecessarily act impatiently.

‘If I slowly relax and think, even the old memories will float up.’

Roan breathed in deeply and raised his head.

Countless stars that flew up onto the night sky were seen.

At that moment.

“Un?”

One of the stars suddenly sharply fell down.

It wasn’t falling while drawing a long tail like a shooting star.

As if a late fall persimmon that pitifully hung on was falling down, a star fell straight towards Roan.

“Just what is……”

Roan slightly creased his brows and tried to step to a side.

But for some reason, his body didn’t move as he wished.

Simultaneously, the objects in front of his eyes grew blurry and then the whole world turned into a world of darkness.

‘Magic? No. It’s not magic.’

Suddenly, a wicked and sinister voice was heard by the edge of his ears.

“Even Roan Lancephil who’s called the hero of the generation is a helpless human. For him to be caught by a simple ghost spell and hypnosis spell like this. Kukukuk.”

A frightening and disturbing laugher.

Soon, similar voices followed and were heard one after another.

“Then should we poke apart his head?”

“What kind of memories would he have.”

“We’ll reveal apart even the terrifying memories you’ve hid deep, deep inside.”

“You are now becoming our doll.”

“Let’s quickly take care of it before the knights and the guards come.”

Bizarre sounds continued.

Roan wanted to shout at the very least, but his mouth didn’t move as he wished.

Suddenly, a pain like a needle was stabbed inside his head was felt.

‘Kuuk.’

An awful pain.

But it wasn’t enough to scream out.

“Aaaaaah!”

“Kuaahk!”

Rather, screams came from a bizarre place.

“Just damn it! Fuck! What is this!”

Voices whose panicked expressions were obvious.

Amongst them, someone screamed at the top of his lungs.

“W, what the? Just what is this memory?”

“Past? No? What is this?”

“Uuak!”

“Thi, this isn’t the past! This isn’t the past!”

Suddenly.

Paat!

Roan felt the world going quiet.

No, to be exact, he lost his consciousness while fully enjoying a greatly comfortable and snug feeling.

In the center of all this, only the inside of Roan’s head was violently roaring like a storm.

Chapter 189




“My son. Eat some of this.”

“This is medicinal herb, this is poison. Got it?”

“Careful!”

“Run! Hurry!”

“Don’t move a bit and stay here. Okay? I love you. My son.”

“Look. That’s Roan, right? They say his parents all died during the last monster attack, no?”

“Village head. I’m sorry. I have eat and live too.”

“You orphan bastard!

“You’re gonna be a soldier? Lunatic.”

His head felt dizzy.

As if a powerful stream flowed, the old memories tore through his head.

“Just why is that thing so dumb?”

“I tell you there’s no use if you are simply earnest.”

“I told you. I knew that you’ll be thrown away even if you devote yourself like that.”

“I heard that you failed to advance to adjutant again, no?”

“You try giving some bribes too.”

“It’s war again. A disgusting war.”

Following that, numerous battles and wars, veiled strifes and schemes filled his head.

“That Pierce became a noble?”

“They say we’re doing a war with the Estia Empire!”

“They say Pierce became a duke, no?”

“It’s the Grand Commander!”

After that, it was the turn for the memories he had forgotten.

And finally.

“There is a bastard alive here.”

The last memory from the last life.

A steel sword stabbed his chest.

And the memories that started again.

“This bastard of a greenhorn slipping out! You dare to sleep while we are on standby for battle?”

“You really are a coward. This is a safe area. There are no such things as monsters.”

“It’s the Ghost squad.”

“The one that died right now was your underling?”

“I’ll definitely get you to Potter fief, sir.”

“Amaranth Troop march!”

The things he’d experienced until now were painted like a scenery.

And.

“Thi, this isn’t the past! This isn’t the past!”

The death throe he heard right before losing his consciousness echoed through his head.

At that moment.

“Huugh!”

Roan gasped and instantly opened his eyes.

“He, he awoke!”

“The lord woke up!”

Suddenly, thunderous voices exploded out from around him.

“Get the doctor and the priest here!”

“Hurry!”

Soon following, hurried orders fell down.

Although Roan had opened his eyes, he wasn’t yet at a state where his senses were clear.

‘What? What’s going on?’

His entire body felt heavy as a wet cotton.

His ears were stunned and his vision was blurry.

Most of all, he felt dizzy as if the inside of his head was spinning.

Soon, a doctor and a priest ran up and meticulously checked Roan’s state multiple times.

“For now, it’s correct that he has awaken.”

“It seems we’ll just have to watch for now.”

Stories that anyone can tell.

“Do move aside sirs.”

Austin pushed the doctor and the priest and came up to Roan’s side.

“My lord. Have you come to? I’m Austin, sir.”

It was a desperate voice.

Following behind, Harrison, Chris, and Brian swarmed up to the bedside.

“I’m Harrison, sir.”

“I’m Chris, sir.”

“I’m Brian, sir.”

The other retainers were also the same.

They all looked at Roan with worried expressions.

Battle-tested warriors.

Majority of them were comrades that went through countless twists and turns together with Roan since the time he was a rank and file spearman.

‘Uum.’

Roan effortfully swallowed the groan that filled up to his throat.

As the blurry vision came back, the faces of his retainers that were surrounding him were seen more clearly little by little.

Faces that seemed like they might immediately burst into tears.

No, the ones like Harrison whose hearts were soft in the first place were already shedding tears.

Roan unknowingly made a faint smile.

“He, he smiled! He smiled!”

Everyone including Austin flustered about.

Harrison brat too wiped his tears with the back of his hand and made a bright smile. (

Collecting his breath, Roan arduously spat out the words that filled up to his throat.

Ten days.

The words Roan, who regained his consciousness ten days after receiving the sudden attack at the mansion’s garden was,

“Harrison. Something bad will happen to you if you cry then laugh.” 1

*****

“During the time, his majesty the king has sent famous doctors and priests, and Prince Simon and nobles sent countless medicines.”

Austin briefly explained the events that had happened within the last ten days.

‘Even his majesty the king’s own doctors and priests came by, you say.’

Even so, there had been no particular improvement.

The retainers including Austin, in case Roan’s health may suddenly slip away, abstained from eating and drinking and stayed up all nights at his side.

The doctors and priests were also frustrated.

Because the state of Roan’s body was extremely normal.

There was not a single reason why he couldn’t awaken.

Roan, who couldn’t come to without even a clear symptom nor treatment method.

The retainers could only watch with restless hearts.

“And I awoke in the middle of that, yes?”

Roan faintly smiled and looked around at the many retainers including Austin.

He was talking while still lying down on the bed with just his upper body up.

“Yes. That is correct, sir. I really thought my lord was……khm.”

Austin couldn’t keep continue his words.

The end of his voice trembled and something hot kept rising up.

He thought Roan was going to die just like that.

His eyeballs hotly heated up.

A look as if thick tears would immediately fall down.

‘Oops.’

Inwardly and slightly shocked, Roan quickly changed the subject.

“What happened to the ones who assaulted me?”

Chris answered as if he had been waiting.

“We’ve caught them for now, sir, but……”

A perplexed look was clear on his face.

“For some reason, they are all in a madden state, sir.”

Brian continued off the rest of the words.

“At first, we interrogated them rather harshly believing that they were acting, but it’s been revealed that they have actually gone mad, sir.”

Since many doctors and priests had checked, it should be an undoubtable truth.

Roan slightly creased his brows.

‘The attackers all lost their minds……?’

On the other hand, his body.

‘Has no particular fault.’

His mana hole went without saying, and even the amount of mana accumulated had absolutely no difference.

Merely.

‘I feel excessively fresh.’

Even though he had lost his consciousness for a long time, the inside of his head felt incredibly clear and fresh.

A feeling as if a headache he suffered for a long time had cleanly been cured.

‘It’s a feeling as if a fog has been clea……’

The moment his thoughts reached that point.

‘Kuk!’

Suddenly, he felt an intense headache.

A pain like a needle was stabbing his head.

‘This is the pain I felt during that attack!’

Roan unconsciously gritted his teeth.

A situation where he didn’t knew if he might soon lose his mind.

At that instant.

Paat!

A light flashed in front of his eyes.

Simultaneously, incredibly many and complicated memories floated up on their own.

‘Memories from when I was young? My parents? This is before entering the army, this is the battle of Ale Gorge……’

Clear memories, hazy memories, forgotten memories.

The memories, meshing together, tangled up complexly.

‘Kuuk.’

With the memory of steel sword stabbing in his chest, the time began to run backwards.

The memories started again from the Rose Battalion.

‘It’s the memories of my second life.’

Memories much clearer than those of the first life.

Numerous memories rapidly flew by one after another.

The memories reached to the point when he was being attacked in the mansion’s garden.

‘Is this the end?’

When such thought entered his mind.

An explosion rang out within his head.

Boom!

Simultaneously, a completely unfamiliar and bizarre memories filled his head.

Even so, they didn’t feel repulsive.

As if they were originally Roan’s memories, they naturally continued and opened again.

But one thing certain was,

‘These aren’t my memories.’

Unknowable memories that wasn’t his own continued on for a long time.

Even Roan, who at first greatly panicked, now found his calm.

Rather, he meticulously perused and looked at the unfamiliar memories full of interesting things.

‘This is……’

Each different and unfamiliar memories opened up five times in a row.

Only then, Roan was able to realize whose memories were inside his head.

‘So they’re the bastards who assaulted me.”

Shockingly, the attackers’ memories were saved inside Roan’s head.

No, not at a simple level of being saved, they were absorbed completely as Roan’s own.

Thanks to that, it wasn’t so difficult to grasp their identities.

‘The identities of the ones who attacked me were hexers. They tried to search through my memories and then turn me into a doll afterwards.’

The surprising point was the person who gave such order.

‘Duke Bradley Webster.’

The light in Roan’s eyes calmly sank.

At that instant, the continuing memories reached their end.

Simultaneously.

Paat!

A light once again flashed in front of his eyes.

“Huu.”

A long sigh flowed out through the gap between the slightly parted lips.

“What is it, sir?”

Austin and the numerous retainers asked with worried expressions.

Roan, with a stiffly hardened expression, looked at Austin.

Suddenly, one memory floated up within his head.

‘Austin. The day we first met, he walked from the camp’s west, picked a fight with Pierce and Glenn, then slantly stood facing me.’

He clearly remembered the situation at the time.

It wasn’t that he remembered since before.

At this very moment, he remembered the old memory he had forgotten.

That wasn’t all.

‘After ten days from now, a small outbreak of monsters will arise in the Pidel region.’

The events of the future that he had dimly known, no, the small and unremarkable events that he had forgotten completely floated up clearly.

‘The memories that were asleep must have all awaken thanks to the hexer bastards.’

A misfortune turned into a blessing.

Roan made a bitter smile.

Inside his head, countless informations and memories repeatedly floated up and sank down without a break.

“My lord?”

“My lord. Are you alright, sir?”

Because of Roan’s somehow blank looking expression, the core retainers asked in worried voices.

Roan cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

“Ah, hmm. I’m fine.”

As he collected his breath, the inside of his head that was complexly storming also found its calm.

‘Then what exactly is the reason the hexer bastards lost their minds……?’

First, he had to check that point.

Roan’s gaze turned towards Chris.

“Then have we not grasped the attackers’ identities?”

The naturally starting question.

“That is so for now, but it isn’t as if there aren’t any possibilities, sir. Because they kept muttering the same words during the interrogation process, we are separately checking that part, sir.”

“Same words?”

When Roan asked back, Austin quickly stepped in.

“They were bizarre words that we simply couldn’t understand, sir. For now, we wrote them down as they sound and sent them to President Clay. Together with my lord’s symptoms, sir. It should soon be about time for the contact to come……”

His gaze naturally headed towards Chris.

Chris faintly smiled as he nodded his head.

“Coincidentally, we just received the news that the reply has arrived and an agent has went outside.”

“Good.”

Roan responded shortly and formed a smile.

“What were the words you said they kept muttering?”

He might be able to suppose the reason why they went mad.

“That’s……”

Chris rummaged through his clothes and took out a small notebook.

“Umm. We’re not sure what they meant, but they were certainly pronunciations like this, sir.”

Very slowly, he exactly pronounced each and every word.

“Venepi Venepi Tempes Inane Legresus.”

As soon as his words ended.

‘Kuuk.’

Roan creased his forehead again and gritted his teeth.

Once again, a sharp pain tore through the inside of his head.

At that instant, the hexers’ memories floated up within his head.

‘Venepi Venepi Tempes Inane Legresus. This is a spell controlling space and time?’

Roan widely opened his eyes.

The words the hexers muttered while insane was a certain spell.

And of that, it was a spell of controlling space and time passed down like a legend and said that no one had attempted nor succeeded.”

‘Control the space and time?’

Roan quickly groped through his memories.

It was as expected.

To control space and time was.

‘To return.’

Returning.

If he was like most people, he would have snort saying it’s an absurd story.

But Roan was different.

Since he himself was a one who directly experienced a return.

‘Let’s see……’

Amongst the hexers’ memories, Roan pulled out the information concerning the spell controlling space and time.

‘To execute the spell that controls space and time, one needs the god metal Astrom as a medium. But this Astrom is only minable from the Golden Dragon Lord Europas’s lair.’

Roan read on the memories inside his head as if reading a book.

‘Golden Dragon Lord Europas?’

There was a memory of hearing, and seeing it.

‘Right. I saw it in a book.’

It was definitely a story he saw at the Rinse Palace Library.

‘Grand Commander’s Baton.’

The unique rank that was temporarily used only when the Rinse Kingdom was set in a crisis.

‘When the Great Warring Era began, Pierce was appointed to the Grand Commander’s rank.’

The old memory, the memory of the future floated up.

The object which was alike the Grand Commander’s mark and symbol, and no different than a national hero and a guardian spirit, was the very Grand Commander’s Baton.

It was said that on the top of the Grand Commander’s baton lies the gem that the Rinse Kingdom’s founding king, Norman Von Rinse, received from the Golden Dragon Lord Europas as a present.

A feeling of one’s head clearing in an instant.

‘Perhaps that baton’s gem is Astrom?’

It was something plentily possible.

Around the time his thoughts were getting a bit deeper.

“My lord?”

He heard Chris’s voice.

It was because Roan was only blankly blinking his eyes without a word.

“Ah, hmm. Yes.”

Roan nodded his head a moment later and formed an awkward smile.

‘Right now isn’t the time to grope at something like memories.’

He couldn’t feign indifference while leaving aside his retainers who were as tired as they could be from looking after his health for ten whole days.

How long must had passed.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Sound of knocking was heard.

Soon, the door opened and a young soldier brought a thick letter.

He was the Agens’ agent who went to bring Clay’s reply.

Chris received the reply and directly passed it to Roan without daring to open it.

Rip.

The sealed envelope opened.

Roan opened Clay’s letter carefully and read it.

“Hmm.”

Instandly, a quiet groan flowed.

Although the letter’s content was significantly long, the core content was written at the head.

Venepi Venepi Tempes Inane Legresus. Although I too can’t remember exactly, the strange words you’ve written to me are similar to a sinister spell appearing in old books. It’s quite similar to the ones the beings often called hexers used, and……

Roan closely pored over each and every word.

If the attackers’ identities are actually hexers, and if the lord has been done in by a sinister hex, it isn’t easy for the state to improve with regular doctors and priests’ treatments. Even if he were to perhaps regain his consciousness, the possibility of him having become mentally crippled or insane is high. Looking at the precedents, there are cases at times where one overcomes the hex’s restraint and instead earns a unique ability as a misfortune turned into a blessing, but this is especially rare……

Clay was Clay.

Using those short information as a basis, he was leading a deduction that was almost close to perfection.

‘He certainly is an incredible guy.’

He couldn’t help but exclaim at his abilities once anew.

Furthermore.

Everyone. I will look for the lord’s treatment method starting now. Everyone, do please look after your bodies and hearts. Although this is purely my personal opinion, but from seeing how the hexers who attacked the lord have gone insane, it might perhaps be that instead of their hex causing harm to the lord they on the contrary caused a big harm to themselves……

Clay was seeing through even the possibility of Roan and the hexers’ position having each reversed.

‘As Clay’s words say, the hexer bastards and my position has reversed.’

The hexers tried to look inside Roan’s head.

But because of a certain reason, the hex became tangled and they instead handed over their memories to Roan.

‘What could be the reason that their spells became tangled?’

That should then be the same as the reason they went mad.

‘There’s a need to look through the hexers’ memories a bit more slowly.’

Roan neatly folded the letter and passed it to Austin.

“Read it.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Austin answered shortly, then closely read the letter’s content together with the many retainers.

Thanks to that, Roan was also able to have a time to separately think.

‘The inside of my head is full of all sort of spells even besides the hexers’ own personal memories.’

All of a sudden, a curiosity arose.

Roan oddly twisted the fingers of his hands.

‘Could I also use the hexes?’

When he fumbled through the hexers’ memories, the possibility of being such was plentily high.

But the problem was the divine power that was surely needed to use the hexes.

Right now, Roan was at a state where the thing called divine power was nonexistent.

‘Let’s see……’

Roan stared at the retainers who were completely occupied from perusing the letter’s content and pushed through the deeper and more secretive memories.

And finally, he found a very short and meaningless hex that he could use even without the divine power.

‘Should I try it?’

Roan twisted and crossed his left forefinger and middle finger, then softly wrapped them with his right hand.

‘Sterrnumen.’

A quietly murmuring sound.

No, a hex.

At the same time.

“Achoo!”

Austin, who was reading Clay’s letter, burst out a sneeze.

“Ehey. Vice Legion Commander. You’re spraying spit all over the place.”

Harrison tapped and dusted his clothes and creased his brows.

Austin, with a bashful expression, raised his hands.

“Sorry. My nose was suddenly itchy, so……’

He tilted his head for a moment, then focused again at the letter’s contents.

‘It succeeded.’

At that sight, Roan inwardly cheered.

A peculiar smile floated up on his face.

It was a smile almost like that of a young child who got a new toy.

The retainers, from focusing on the contents of Clay’s letter, didn’t see that face.

‘A misfortune really has turned into a blessing.’

Roan tightly clenched his fist.

The restoration of his old memories, the reason he came back to the past, the hexers’ abilities.

For having slept for ten days like a dead man, the things he earned were simply too many.

‘Then, should I slowly go back to the fief?’

Due to the unexpected issue, the returning to the fief was delayed longer than he had thought.

Now was the phase to quickly go back down to the fief and prepare for the next.

Of course.

‘I should go visit the princess before that.’

Roan had words that he wished to tell Aily.

The words he wished to say before it became even later.

For some reason, his heart raced and his face blushed brightly.

At that moment, Austin, who had completely checked out the letter’s contents, panicked with a startle-shocked expression.

“My lord! Are you okay, sir? You aren’t hurt anywhere, sir, no? Your face is red!”

Chapter 190




The capital, Miller, shook once again.

Sir Count Roan Lancephil has woken up!

The Miller Castle’s residents cheered.

In the case of commoners, it was general for them to quake with irritation at the nobles.

However, Roan was an exception.

It wasn’t because he was a general and a hero who raised outstanding military achievements.

“Sir Count Lancephil is different than other nobles.”

“He’s a man who’s at our side and not above our heads.”

A noble who treated people as people without discrimination of status.

That was the very reason the ordinary commoners loved and respected Roan.

And.

“I’m really glad.”

There was another person who was joyous enough to shed tears.

Aily Rinse.

Wiping the tears with a back of her hand, she gazed straight at Roan’s face.

She tried not to cry.

No, she thought she shouldn’t cry.

‘What would he think if I cry……’

Such thoughts entered her mind.

But the moment she saw Roan, clear tears flowed regardless of her will.

“Thank you very much for worrying about me, your highness.”

Roan slightly bowed his head.

The instant he saw Aily crying, a corner of his heart turned soft.

‘Princess Aily.’

Amongst the memories that awakened thanks to the hexers’ assault, there were also ones about Aily.

‘Three years from now, princess will catch an epidemic and die.’

A news he heard through one ear and out the next in the last life because she was an individual with such a lack of presence.

It was a dreadful future.

But he didn’t worry.

‘It probably was a faked death.’

The reason Roan thought so.

‘Since three years from now is the time when Gold Master Sale fully begins to move.’

Probably, Aily met the Great Warring Era and threw away her status as a princess.

‘Is the princess Aily, Sale, or Piscis……’

Roan gazed quietly at Aily’s large eyes.

‘If she, as princess willed and not by someone else’s decision, lived a life she herself wanted, then……’

Her desire and wish.

Roan planned to help so that Aily can live as such.

And he wished that he would be at her side.

‘I merely do as my heart says.’

In the last life, he lost love while chasing his dream.

In the end, both dream and love, he failed all of them.

But the life this time was different.

‘Dream, and love too……’

The first step.

Roan planned to embolden his feeling to Aily.

“Princess. I’ve visited today because I have something I need to say.”

The end of his voice slightly shook.

“I really don’t have a talent in this kind of thing, so I’m not sure how to say this.”

A feeling like he had became a fool.

But it wasn’t an unpleasant feeling.

His heart rapidly raced.

Aily quietly sat and nodded her head.

Her face too was colored brightly.

Roan faintly smiled and collected his breath for a moment.

“I thought that there are reasons to loving someone. So I thought once, twice, thrice, tens, hundreds of of times.”

HIs gaze went towards Aily.

“Of the reason I liked your highness princess.”

Aily tightly grasped her two hands.

The tips of her eyes rapidly trembled.

“But I couldn’t find it.”

Roan’s words continued on.

The story of his heart that began to burst out once continued on unhesitantly like a violent stream.

“There was no reason. I just like you. Without any reason……”

Roan looked straight at Aily’s eyes.

“I like you, princess.”

*****

“Waaaaah!”

“Roan Lancephil! Roan Lancephil!”

Cheers poured down.

At the grand street that cut the capital, Miller, to north and south.

Around it, the Miller Castle’s residents poured out.

With crimson roses in their hands, they screamed at the top of their lungs.

“Roan! Roan! Roan!”

“The Crimson Ghost! The Crimson Ghost!”

Simon Rinse clicked his tongue at the boiling heat of the castle’s citizens.

“You truly have a great popularity.”

“It’s an excessive praise, your highness.”

The one softly smiling and slightly lowering his head was Roan.

But he too couldn’t hide his pride.

It wasn’t merely because people liked him.

‘It’s proof that what I’m doing is not wrong.’

Walking on the correct path.

And people recognizing that.

They made his heart proud.

“Anyhow, do you truly plan to leave like this?”

Simon shook Roan’s hand with regrettable expression.

The numerous nobles that lined behind him were also the same.

“Sir Count Lancephil. Please stay a bit longer before you go.”

“We didn’t in fact have much time to talk because you were down, sir.”

“I have a good wine, sir. I truly wish to serve it to you.”

Sweet words overflowed.

The nobles who supported Simon wanted to make favorable impressions with Roan in any way possible.

Looks that weren’t very different even at the fact that Roan was from a commoner background.

‘What use is that now?’

‘If Prince Simon becomes the next king like this, Count Lancephil will rise to a status with merely one above and everyone below.’

‘He’ll at least become a duke. Looking at the last time, it seems the prince is even considering him as the princess’ partner.’

The nobles were shrewd.

Roan too had surmised their intentions.

‘I have no heart to play with those games.’

With a sad and regrettable expression, he lowered his head.

“I’m sorry, your highness. I’ve left the fief empty for much too long.”

An indirect refusal.

“I know it can’t be helped, but…… even so, it’s sad and still regrettable, sir.”

Simon exhaled a short sigh.

“Once the work here is somewhat cleaned up, I will go take a visit to the Lancephil Fief.”

“Yes, your highness. I will await your visit.”

Roan once again lowered his head and then stepped back.

Once he climbed above a mammoth warhorse, the magnificence of a great general spouted out.

“Waaaaaah!”

The sound of citizens’ cheers turned much louder.

Roan lightly raised his right hand, then added a short salute towards Simon.

“Then excuse me……”

As he pulled the reins, the warhorse snorted a rough neigh.

Clop. Clop.

Roan, who went alone between the colossal waves of crowds.

The sight of his back on top of the warhorse truly looked grand.

Gulp.

The cheers slowly sank.

“Umm.”

All swallowed dryly.

Roan’s crimson armor reflected the light and flashed.

Although Roan was alone, he exuded an incredible presence and pressure comparable to an army of a hundred thousand.

A silence where the space and time seemed to have literally stopped.

Between that, only Roan was moving by himself.

Finally, he passed through the Miller Castle’s north gate.

“Waaaaaaaah!

“Roan Lancephil! Roan Lancephil!”

As if it had awaited, the incredible cheer that had been suppressed blasted out.

“Hmm.”

Simon and the numerous nobles, with slightly dazed expressions, moved their steps towards the ramparts of the north gate.

Swoosh!

When they climbed on top of the rampart, a southern wind pushed their backs.

Instantly, the wide plain that spread outside the north gate filled their views.

“Ah……”

A weak hearted man amongst the nobles let out a quiet exclamation.

The other nobles too all looked greatly shocked and daunted, and merely didn’t let out a sound.

A crimson wave.

“So that’s the crimson legion……”

Simon and Viscount Tio Ruin murmured with voices mixed with awe.

It was a grand sight.

Crimson soldiers neatly lined up on the wide plain murmuring with green light.

The Tale Legion and the Lancephil Legion, even in front of the violent southern wind, stood their places without a tremble.

The legion flag, the troop flag, and the commanders’ flags that rose at the vanguard violently flapped.

To the front of it, Roan was approaching.

Paat!

Suddenly, together with an incredible pressure, the legion’s soldiers saluted.

The soundless salute was, even just by the sight of it, was enormously pressuring.

“Uuuuh.”

Few scholarly nobles chattered their teeth and shrunk back their necks.

Meanwhile, Roan turned his horse and looked towards the Miller Castle.

No, to be exact, he stared at Simon and the numerous nobles standing at the ramparts.

Very slowly, Roan made a salute.

“Salute.”

A quietly worded sound.

It wasn’t even a sound that could be easily heard.

But soon, a shout like the eardrums would explode followed behind.

“Salute!”

The shout the soldiers of the crimson legion poured out.

That sound became a force and stormed the Miller Castle.

“Huugh.”

Not only the scholarly nobles but also the warrior nobles whose bones were battle-hardened on the battlefields couldn’t quite endur and trembled.

Goosebumps burst all over their bodies.

A feeling as if their throats were suffocated.

“Hhm.”

Simon leaked a quiet groan.

His heart was complicated.

A feeling both proud yet worried.

‘It’s a great strength when at the side……’

But if turned into an enemy, a vexing existence.

No, not only at a level of being vexing, he was an existence dangerous enough for the throne succession competition to flip in an instant.

‘I must make him my man.’

The several plans he had already made brushed through his head.

Meanwhile, Roan, who was watching the ramparts, pulled his rein once again.

He looked at the crimson legion and gave a short order.

“Crimson Legion, march.”

The instant the order fell, the thousand-man commanders and above shouted at the members of the troop below them.

“March!”

“March!”

“Let us go home!”

The enormous legion moved without an error like a single body.

The Crimson Legion that filled the Miller Castle’s southern plain disappeared with a rapid speed as if an ebb flows out.

“Viscount Ruin.”

Simon, who was watching quietly, called Tio.

Tio stepped in closer and lowered his head.

“Yes. Please speak, your highness.”

Simon chased Roan’s back that was receding further away and spoke in a much quieter voice.

“I will have to place a trap.”

“Where should we place it, sir?”

A cautious expression and voice.

Simon answered shortly.

“Aily.”

*****

Return.

Finally, the Crimson Legion finished the fief war and returned to the Mediasis Castle.

Furthermore, together with a sweet spoil of the war called fief war victory.

“Waaaaah!”

“Roan Lancephil! Roan Lancephil!”

“Tale Legion! Tale Legion!”

“Lancephil Legion! Lancephil Legion!”

“Crimson Legion! Crimson Legion!”

It was obvious that the Mediasis Castle shook from a welcoming ceremony.

Especially as the Mediasis Castle became selected as the capital of the new Lancephil Fief that expanded by more than twice, the heat of the castle’s residents were hotter and greater than any other time.

Because the Pavor Castle, which was the capital of the original Lancephil Fief, was scheduled to adjust and supported to become the center of culture, arts, and education, the responses of the old Lancephil Fief’s citizens were also not bad.

Harmony and coexistence.

Thankfully, the Tale Fief’s citizens and the Lancpehil Fief’s citizens understood each other well.

While the fierce welcome of the castle’s citizens was continuing, a noisy conversation was continuing at the lord’s castle, no, at a slightly large building located at the center of the Mediasis Castle.

“Eh?! Then do you mean the lord moving separately by himself?”

Clay, who usually had no case of being surprised, widely opened his eyes and raised his voice.

Austin, who was sitting on the opposite side, awkwardly smiled and nodded his head.

“That is, he said that there was a place he had to visit when half way……”

“Even so, so sent him to that place alone? The lord? There’s still Count Chase and Viscount Owells’ remnants……”

When his words reached about that point.

“He wasn’t alone. He went with Walter.”

Brian subtly squeezed in and cut his words.

“Ah, so we can relax since he went together with Walter whose left are was cut off and his mana hole destroyed?”

“Tha, that is……”

At Clay’s bladed words, Brian stuttered his words and then soon closed his mouth.

At that moment, Harrison, who had been staying quiet, spoke in a brusque voice while crossing his arms.

“It is what the lord wished. We simply need to follow his orders.”

At those words, Clay stared straight at Harrison’s eyes.

Bold eyes without a bit of hesitation or indecision.

Even, the ones with such eyes wasn’t only Harrison.

Austin, Brian, Keep, Glenn……

The light in the eyes of the core retainers were boldness itself.

‘Huu.’

With a short sigh, Clay nodded his head.

“Understood. It can’t be helped since it’s something that already happened. But I must definitely say just this one thing clearly.”

With a calm and clear voice, he added on.

“I understand everyone’s loyalties plenty well. But even so, it is problematic to give unconditional loyalty to the lord.”

“What do you mean? President Clay.”

Austin creased his brows.

Clay, with a tip of his finger, pointed at his chest.

“An unconditional loyalty makes one’s chest hot. But……”

The tip of the finger headed towards his head.

“It also makes one’s head stiff.”

His gaze swept through the numerous retainers.

“If you are a truly loyal subject, do not be afraid to remonstrate. Things that are wrong must be said to be wrong, and one must be able to present opposition at irrational orders. If we were to remain silent even while knowing that the path is wrong and follow unconditionally……”

Clay’s expression turned fierce.

“We will all fall down a cliff.”

“Hhm.”

Everyone including Austin and Harrison leaked a groan.

Clay’s statement.

They were words he had decided and spat out because he had already experienced similar events numerous times.

Clay looked at the retainers of grave expressions and lowered his head.

“I apologize if I was somewhat arrogant. To please think of it word for word as a warning.”

With those words as final, he exited the meeting room.

“Huu.”

A long sigh twisted and leaked through his lips.

‘Would they change a bit……’

A smile hang at Clay’s mouth.

Loyalty and remonstration.

If one was a good subordinate, there was a need to have all of the two.

But it wasn’t because of merely such reason that Clay spoke out the words this time.

‘It’s a given that even medicines good for the body have side effects.’

Clay.

Even while doing one work, he was always aiming for more than two, three effects.

‘Now, should I then see what the lord is doing?’

The smile hanging on his mouth became much deeper.

Chapter 191




A southern wind blew.

‘So summer is now coming.’

Feeling the sunshine that poured down above his entire body as if to shatter, Roan raised his head.

A blue sky without a single bit of cloud endlessly spread.

Swoosh!

At that moment, several small birds formed a flock and flew towards the sky above his head.

Instantly, the light in Roan’s eyes sank low.

From his mana hole, a strand of mana climbed up then quickly spun along the mana road.

His five senses opened up and all his senses turned sharp.

‘Hmm.’

As if sightseeing the scenery, Roan looked around his surroundings naturally.

Through the Kalian’s Tears, every direction was seen clearly as if his hands could touch them.

‘Is it merely birds and mice, cats and dogs……’

A bitter smile hang on his mouth.

‘Clay truly is busy.’

Sensing that Clay was spying on his every little move was something that happened a few days ago.

‘It was the moment before the Arslan Battle.”

At that time before the battle, Clay knew even the fact that Roan had given a secret order to Walter.

Meaning that he was using the spy and monitoring animals of the Bureau of Druids to watch him.

Although there was no definite proof at the time, that wasn’t so now.

‘As a result of checking from time to time after then, there’s usually two, three animals, and about seven animals at noteworthy moments attached to me.’

It was a somewhat excessive measure at the time when the number of animals assigned to Agens and Tenebra Troop still wasn’t large.

‘With what intent does he have……’

If that intent wasn’t just, he had no plan to particularly hold him close to his heart.

The Great Warring Era.

However much talented individuals were important, he couldn’t live while holding a knife to his neck.

Furthermore, the Great Warring Era was when betrayal and treachery were rampant.

‘With the newly gained memories and information as a basis, I will strengthen the internal affairs.’

Looking for Clay’s true intent was also one of those.

“What are you thinking of, my lord?”

At that moment, a quiet voice was heard from his side.

A young man without his left arm.

He was Walter Owells, no, simply Walter.

Roan took his gaze away from the sky and looked at Walter.

‘Walter.’

His heart ached.

With a single wrong judgment, he almost lost a valuable individual.

Although he had at least saved his life, he had lost his possibility as an ordinary knight.

Naturally, his face solidified stiffly.

“Are you blaming yourself again, sir?”

Perhaps having guessed Roan’s complicated heart, Walter formed a faint smile.

With his right hand, he touched his chest.

“The one who said he will personally untie the tie and requested it was me, my lord.”

It was the truth.

From the moment Walter had done undercover infiltration at Owells Camp, he had made a request to at least leave the cleanup of his father Kali Owells to him.

A cruel situation.

Roan too at first strongly opposed.

However, Walter obstinately asked for it saying that the Owells House must untie the knot the Owells House had twisted.

And the deep and adamant wrath towards Kali that showed at the same time.

Roan saw that look and made the wrong judgment and decision.

‘I should have opposed it to the end at that time……’

His heart felt stunned.

Walter, seeing that look, made a much brighter smile.

“It’s my fault for having a weak heart, my lord. It’s not my lord’s mistake.”

He too didn’t expect that he would end up lowering his sword at the last moment.

He thought that he should be able to slash Kali’s neck and perfectly untie the foully tangled tie.

But the result was,

‘I became like this.’

Walter exhaled a short sigh.

Everything was his own fault.

But.

‘Even so, the lord didn’t throw me away.’

Although Roan was endlessly sorry, Walter was instead truly thankful to Roan.

He did not threw away a one-armed swordsman, and a swordsman whose mana hole was destroyed at that, and embraced him.

That wasn’t all.

“I will give you a new chance.”

Roan spoke with a voice full of certainty.

He promised.

A chance to fly once again, a chance to spread his name once again.

Roan intended to open a new path for the one-armed swordsman whose mana hole was destroyed.

Walter, without hesitation, grabbed Roan’s hand.

He too didn’t wish to give up his life like that.

Roan and Walter.

The two people’s gazes fiercely met.

“Then should we go now?”

Now was almost time for the sun to set.

They had to hurry.

The name of a featureless village clearly float up.

‘Theturn village.’

The village itself had nothing special.

But on this season, there was an old man who was doing a bizarre act around the Theturn village.

An old man who no one paid attention to at the time.

But merely three years later, a young man said to be that old man’s apprentice would end up spreading an incredible fame.

‘Theturn’s Steel Warrior Higgs.’

A monstrous man who rejected mana and radically trained the body itself.

Roan’s eyes flashed and shone a light.

‘If Walter can become that old man’s apprentice……’

If it was Walter’s talent, he would easily become a powerful warrior that would exceed the Steel Warrior Higgs from the last life.

His footsteps naturally turned faster.

Together with tension, anticipation floated up on his face.

Far away, the Theturn Village was visible.

Although it was a small and unattractive countryside village, to Roan, no to Walter, no, to both men, it was a land of hope and a chance.

*****

“Is it neither failure nor success?”

The head of the 12 Hatchling and a viscount of the Rinse Kingdom Sith Wiggins, together with a short sigh, shook his head.

“He has now become a count instead of a baron. Meaning that he won’t feel the need to work together with us.”

The beautiful woman, baroness Elva Dionell looked around with a solidly stiffen expression at the young nobles. 1

The reason the 12 Hatchlings have all gathered today.

That was because of the issue of recruiting Roan Lancephil.

Although Elva had personally went and appealed, there was no particular progress to now.

“Even so, we can’t stop persuading him.”

Sith couldn’t give up like that.

His gaze naturally went towards Elva.

“Evla. It will be arduous, but I’ll ask of you once more.”

“You want me to go all the way to Lancephil Fief and back?”

Roan had already long left the capital, Miller.

Sith slowly nodded his head.

“Either way, it’s a situation where the members of us, the 12 Hatchlings too have to scatter due to the missions we each took on.”

Numerous nobles nodded at those words and added on.

“I have to follow Mills Voisa and and go to Estia Empire.”

“I’m scheduled to go to the Iimas Union together with Chester Kowan.” 2

“I’m to the kingdom’s south.”

“I’ve been given the border guard duty.”

The missions that follow one after another.

The majority of them were protecting and supporting the prince they each support.

Sith’s expression turned dark.

‘Since it’s difficult to obtain an opportunity to counter in the kingdom’s interior, they’re slowly turning their eyes towards outside the kingdom.’

Already, the Second Prince Tommy Rinse and the Third Prince Kallum Rinse’s supporting factions had frequent exchanges with numerous empires and kingdoms and their relationships were also on the very positive side.

‘I too can’t simply be sucking on my fingers.’

Sith too had received Simon’s order and had to go around and persuade the neutral faction nobles.

Compared to him, Elva was of a slightly relaxed state.

Although her abilities were outstanding, others didn’t easily entrust crucial duties due to the reason that she was a woman.

“Elva. Please.”

Sith softly stared at Elva’s eyes.

‘Hhm.’

Elva couldn’t quite refuse.

When Sith looked at her like now and asked, she wanted to answer whatever it was.

“Huu. I got it.”

Ultimately, Elva nodded her head together with a short sigh.

“I’ll personally go to the Lancephil Fief.”

A cool decision.

“Thanks.”

Sith faintly smiled and held Elva’s hand.

Throb.

Elva’s face instantly burned bright.

On the other hand, Sith’s expression showed no change at all.

Merely the thankful and sorry looks were lucid.

Elva lightly bit her lower lips.

‘Sith Wiggins. Do you truly don’t know my feelings?’

She wanted to ask.

But she didn’t quite knew.

That Sith was already answering that question with his entire body.

‘I know. Elva. Of your feelings…… but……’

His eyes became colored with inky light.

Tragically, that was not such a pleasant light.

*****

“Uah! Seriously! Oi! You bastards! I told you I’ll make your son into an invincible general if you just leave him to me!”

An unsightly old man with hair that was greyed with bits of white hair strands shouted while spitting out spit.

“Tch tch tch. One should turn old gently.”

“From what I heard, he already went around all the nearby villages.”

“They say he got chased out of all the other villages.”

“To have to pay one silver for entrusting one’s son. That’s a thief, a thief.”

The Theturn Village’s people gathered below a large tree and chattered acrid prattle.

The gazes staring at the old man weren’t very friendly.

“Just one silver! I tell you, I’ll make your son into an invincible general if you just pay one silver!”

The white haired old man, not minding even the people’s pointing, shouted aloud.

However, there was no one who showed interest.

No, rather.

“Oi! You insane old man! At least beg if you are hungry! Who knows if someone might throw you a moldy bread?”

There were ones strutting around and mocking him.

“Ei. So this village is also wrong.”

The old man clicked his tongue and shook his head.

Before he knew it, the dusk was falling on his surroundings.

‘Even though my remaining life isn’t very long……’

Finding an apprentice was as hard as plucking a star in the sky.

He stared at his two bony arms.

‘Do I look really that untrustworthy?’

At that moment.

“Sir.”

A soft and powerful voice was heard.

The old man slightly creased his brows and turned his head towards the direction the sound was heard from.

Two well-built young men were staring at him.

“Who’re you?”

A greeting without even an eye booger much of etiquette.

A manly looking one between the young men lowered his head first.

“You seemed to be telling an interesting story.”

Suddenly, a glow shined on the old man’s face.

‘Alright! I’ve done it!’

He quickly glanced meticulously over the two young men.

‘Both of them have good bone structure and even have good balance. Hhm. But one guy doesn’t have a left arm. Well, that isn’t a very big problem, but……’

His eyes flashed and shone with light.

But at that moment, the light on his face quickly turned dark.

‘Ei. This manly looking kid is already practicing mana techniques. Ei. Tch tch tch. Useless bastard.’

The old man squinted his forehead.

He became excited on his own, then became disappointed by himself.

Because numerous emotions were revealed plainly, it was a sight that naturally brought out smiles from the people who were watching.

The young man who spoke up first, with composed gaze, stared at the old man.

‘This person is the very old man who raised Theturn’s Steel Warrior Higgs.’

The young man’s identity was Roan.

Of course, the one-armed young man was Walter.

To walk a new path, they had finally arrived at the Theturn Village.

Roan looked at the old man in front of his eyes and inwardly shook his head.

‘To think an old man like this raised the Theturn’s Steel Warrior Higgs.’

It truly was incredible.

In truth, many people in the last life tried to find Steel Warrior Higgs’s master after he appeared.

But they ultimately couldn’t find Higgs’s master nor even find the place he had trained, and there was one big reason for that.

Higgs was simply and unbelievably dumb.

Not only the master’s name, he couldn’t even remember where he had trained.

A degree where remembering at least that the village he first met the master was Theturn was commendable.

The people swarmed to Theturn Village, but they couldn’t find Higgs’s master anywhere.

Meanwhile, the dumb Higgs roamed the battlefield believing in his strength then fell into a trap and died an untimely death.

An empty death.

The people quickly forgot about the memories about Higgs and his master.

Because the Great Warring Era wasn’t so poor in talents to hang over past events.

Roan too had completely forgot about Higgs and Theturn.

Even when he tried to remember it again, the name of the village was hazy.

During that time and with the recent hexers’ assault as a catalyst, he had came to remember the old memory.

‘Although he did die anticlimactically, the monstrous strength Higgs showed at the time truly was an incredible thing.’

If Higgs’s head was at least at an average level, he would more than become an invincible general like the old man’s words.

The people of that time often shared fierce debates on just why he had chosen dumb Higgs of all people as his apprentice.

And the instant Roan saw the old man today, he came to know the reason.

‘If it wasn’t someone as dumb as Higgs, no one would’ve became the old man’s apprentice.’

The appearance of old man in front of him was unbelievable to that much degree.

To call him the man who raised the Steel Warrior, he was simply too bony.

The old man, perhaps having read the light in Roan’s eyes, spread out grand words together with a cough.

“Khm. It isn’t just an interesting story. Although it’ll sound absurd, you can be an invincible general if you become my apprenti……”

When his words reached about that point.

“I accept, sir.”

Roan immediately cut his words and took out one silver from his cloth.

Instantly, the white haired old man creased his brows.

“You aren’t perhaps planning to be my apprentice yourself, right?”

The guy who learned the mana could never become his apprentice.

Roan nodded his head.

“Yes sir. The one who will become the apprentice is my brother.”

He turned his head and looked at Walter.

Walter, with deeply moved expression, lowered his head.

Already, he had heard from Roan that they came to meet an eccentric man when they arrived at the village.

And that old man would give him a new chance too.

Because of that, he had absolutely no doubts about the old man.

He was greatly and deeply moved at the fact that Roan had unhesitantly called him a brother.

Roan looked straight at the old man and spoke in a powerful voice.

“Please make my brother into the strongest general in the world, sir.”

“Hmm.”

The old man, who had been smiling sarcastically, leaked out a short groan.

A man who would react seriously and prudently like this to his words was a first.

“You, who are you?”

Even the haughty speech that looked down on them disappeared.

Roan did not particularly hide his identity.

“Roan Lancephil. I am a count of the Rinse Kingdom.”

“Ah……”

Instantly, the old man let out a quiet exclamation.

Although he lived an isolated life that wasn’t quite isolated deep in a middle of mountains, he too had heard of Roan’s name.

The Rinse Kingdom’s rising hero.

The old man quickly lowered his head.

“I’ve been discourteous to Sir Count.”

“No sir.”

Roan gently shook his head and then held Walter’s shoulder.

“My brother’s master is also my master, sir.”

At those words, the old man slightly raised his head, then made an awkward smile.

A look that was indecisive without being able to do this or that.

Roan faintly smiled and asked in a small voice.

“What is it, sir?”

“It’s……”

The old man hesitated for a moment, then answered in a cautious manner.

“My training method is truly arduous and painful. It is in fact even very dangerous. An ordinary person can never endure it. Even though I took in three apprentices until now, all of them couldn’t endure ten days and ran away.”

At those words, Walter, who had been silent, stepped forwards.

“I will never run away, sir.”

A voice filled with a determined will.

The light in his eyes too were sharp and bold.

The old man, looking at that sight, slowly nodded his head.

“You certainly seemed so, sir. But even if the person himself can endure it, there are cases of getting greatly injured with the smallest of mistake.”

To such a degree, the old man’s training method was dangerous.

Walter, this time as well, didn’t hesitate.

“I’m already a body without an arm. I’m not afraid of getting hurt.”

“Hhm.”

The old man once again leaked a groan.

But even at Walter’s bold spirit, his expression didn’t improve a bit.

Walter creased his brows.

“Am I that untrustworthy, sir?”

At those words, the old man shook his head.

“Not at all. I like you very much.”

“Then why is your expression so dark, sir?”

Walter asked again.

The old man hesitated for a moment, then looked at Roan.

“Sir count. The young man next to you is undoubtedly an incredible talent. If I were to teach him, he will certainly become an invincible general.”

Roan quietly listened to the old man’s words.

The old man, with quite a serious expression, added on.

“Would that be fine, sir? If this young man becomes an invincible general, he may climb to a higher position than Sir Count.”

The old man was worrying that Walter would no longer be able to stay under Roan if he became the strongest general in the world..

With a solidly stiffen expresion, Walter spoke.

“Whether I become a count, marquis, or duke when I become the strongest general in the world, I will always serve my lord.”

“But there’s the way of the world……”

When the old man was shaking his head with a serious expression.

Roan, who had been silent, softly smiled and spoke.

“I don’t mind, sir. Please make Walter into the strongest general in the world.”

“Would that be alright, sir?”

The old man cautiously asked.

Roan nodded his head.

“Yes. That is alright. Because I too……”

A gentle majesty poured out from his entire body.

“Merely need to become a man worthy of the strongest general in the world.”

“Eh? If it’s a man worthy of the strongest general in the world……”

The old man dryly swallowed.

Roan merely smiled.

Rather than with his mouth, he answered with his heart instead.

‘I plan to become the world.’

Chapter 192




“Huu. It’s still mindlessly busy.”

“Of course. Since he is the one that’s standing out the most these days.”

“His status has now climbed to count. Just how many people do you think are coming to visit from all over the place and trying to make good impressions?”

“Also, anyone with a strand of talent must all be rushing in since Sir Count Roan Lancephil is someone who inherently values talented people in the first place.”

Six young man looked at the Count Lancephil House’s enormous visitors reception room and shook their heads.

The reception room was, even from a glance, full of an incredible wave of people, but not a single small disturbance arose despite so.

When there occasionally were those who raised their voices, guards with neatly made uniforms came up and escorted them out with courteous manner.

An exceedingly mannerly reception.

At that moment.

“Welcome, sirs. I am Darren of Lancephil Division of Human Resources. May I ask your purpose in visiting our lord’s castle?”

A middle-aged man wearing a uniform approached and bowed his head.

“Ah, we heard that Sir Count Lancephil widely employs talented individuals, so we have lowered our heads and came to visit.”

One amongst the young men quickly answered.

“I see.”

Darren bightly smiled and opened up a thick visitor’s log.

Incredibly many names were already written down on the visitor’s log.

Although most people would had instantly lost their spirits the moment they saw that visitor’s log, the six young men had absolutely no such look.

“You may have to wait a little long, sirs.”

Darren apologized first.

Because although there were no one who acted thoughtlessly or cause trouble thanks to Roan’s fame, it was possible for dissatisfaction and complaints to explode out.

The six young men, with pleased expressions, nodded their heads.

“Yes. We can wait for however long.”

“It’s our fault for being later than others.”

Brightly smiling looks.

It was a sight that even made Darren pleasant.

“Thank you for your understanding, sirs. Then please tell me your names one by one.”

At those words, one of the young man pushed his head out.

“I’m Swift, sir.”

Following that, the other young men revealed their names one by one.

“Buro, sir.” 1

“I’m Raitler.”

“I’m Rotner, sir.”

“My name is Griffin.”

“Nunse, sir.”

It was the moment Darren nodded his head and was just about to write down their names.

“Eh?”

Together with a surprised voice, a middle aged man with a neatly worn uniform approached from a side.

Although it was a face truly without any distinct character, he was a man of an impression that strangely made people comfortable.

“Director Onil.”

Darren slightly lowered his head towards the middle-aged man.

The middle aged man was the head manager of the Lancephil Division of Human Resources he was in as well as his immediate superior, Onil.

Onil lowered his head towards Darren too, then stood in front of the six young men.

“All six sirs, it has been a while.”

A greeting passed with welcoming expression.

The six young men made surprised expressions.

“Do you remember us, sir?”

Seemingly having difficulty in believing, they widely opened their eyes.

On the other hand, Onil faintly smiled and nodded his head as if to say of course.

“Of course, sirs. You were descendants of noble houses and graduates of Tron Academy. Have you not visited the temporary mansion at the capital, Miller, in the past then left saying you’ve realized something and will come back after learning more about the world?”

“That is exactly correct, sir.”

Amongst the six young men, Swift nodded his head with a slightly dazed expression.

‘Even though hundreds of people should be coming and going each day……’

‘Even though it was just a moment-long meeting a few years ago……’

‘To think he would remember that……’

The young men couldn’t stop their exclamations.

The six young men.

Swift, Buro, Raitler, Rotner, Griffin, Nunse.

They were the graduates who had received Tron Academy’s Principal Fred Brown’s recommendation and visited Roan.

They, who were pompous at the time, met Viscount Reil Baker at a reception room and received a big realization.

They realized their narrow-mindedness and their deficiencies on their own and greatly felt ashamed.

They went out on a study of the world in order to fill the parts they lacked and had came to visit Roan after finally gaining desired results.

‘Their faces are all good.’

Onil looked at the six young men’s faces and inwardly made proud smiles.

The day the six young men realized their shamefulness on their own and left.

Onil met Clay in front of the visitors reception room.

‘At the time, President Clay……’

Said greatly arrogant words while looking at the backs of the young men who left.

‘He said what kind of big things could they possibly do without certainty and trust in their own abilities and that there wasn’t anyone that can compare to his talents even though there were so many people coming to visit.’

At the time, Onil couldn’t agree to Clay’s words.

He believed and didn’t doubt that the six young men who realized their deficiencies on their own and left to the world outside would one day return as great men.

And.

‘I resolved to personally write down their names on the visitor’s log myself like the last time at the time when they return……’

Onil extended his hand towards Darren.

“I’ll personally write them.”

“Yes. Understood, sir.”

Darren handed over the visitor’s log and a pen.

Onil meticulously wrote down the six young men’s names and their details.

“Should I bring out the refreshments”?

A question he asked while brightly smiling.

It was the same conversation like the time they first met.

Swift, unlike the last time, brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“Since it looks like we’ll have to wait a long time, please give us a lot if possible.”

They now had peace in their hearts.

“Yes, sirs. I’ll prepare plenty.”

Onil slightly lowered his head, then moved his feet.

‘They’re good individuals.’

At the least, he was confident that his eyes for people were good.

It was a part even others acknowledged.

Because so, he was able to climb up to the position of the Division of Human Resources’ director.

‘They are people who will do great things for our fief.’

He felt such certainty.

And as expected, the six young men would henceforth be called within few years as Lancephil’s Six Brains by the world.

If Lancephil’s Six Brains all gather, even the God Brain Clay cannot act as he wish.

A rumor that shook the world.

But a rumor even more famous than that was,

The one who breathed life into the Lancephil Fief isn’t the God Brain, the God Spear, or the Light, but the Gentle Breeze Onil.

Of course, these two rumors were still something that would be talked about by the people much later.

******

Roan quietly returned.

It was because he didn’t wish to once again raise an uproar when the Crimson Legion had already received a grand welcome.

From the day he arrived at the Mediasis Castle, he didn’t rest for even a single moment.

He rapidly processed the various and incredibly many pending issues that were backed up until now.

‘Chris knows this better than me. And Keep is an expert on this. Pichio is also excellent.’

Besides the issues Roan himself had to make decision on, he respected his retainers’ opinions as much as possible.

Because the retainers weren’t simply servants but were recognized as experts in each fields.

Thanks to that, the processing speed of the pending issues were blindingly fast.

It was a level even Clay would shake his head at.

‘Since the fief’s size has expanded by more than twice, I will also have to reset the overall field.’

Roan placed the talented individuals that swarmed up from every side at right places for the right individuals.

Simultaneously, he once again reorganized the county’s organization system.

With the various memories that newly awoke from the hexers’ assault as the basis and with Clay and the administrators’ help, he set up a much more fine and efficient advancement system.

‘I can’t neglect the academy and magic tower constructions, and expansion and aid to the mercenary guild either.’

It wasn’t a work that had results that would immediately show up.

But.

‘Although recruiting outside talents is also important, strengthening the internal stability by ourselves too is important.’

Roan planned to strengthen from the fief’s base and roots.

As much as the fief had increased, the number of fief’s citizens had also sharply rose.

Naturally, the number of individuals with outstanding talents amongst them also drastically rose higher than before.

Roan planned to give a chance at education to them and let them freely show off the abilities they have.

Each and every day, mindlessly busy days passed.

And finally, the first official event since Roan returned to the fief opened.

That was neither a merit ceremony, an inheritance ceremony, nor a nobility investment ceremony.

Ppabam! Ppababam! Ppabam!

Milta Military Band’s grand performance.

The commanders of thousand-man rank and higher, while wearing newly fitted crimson uniforms, lowered their heads.

Behind them, more than thousands of Crimson Legion’s soldiers soundlessly saluted.

Together with heated gazes, hotter tears welled.

At the place where everyone’s gazes met.

At the top of a giant gate that brought a triumphal arc to mind, a stone plate carved with powerful calligraphy was hanged.

Lancephil Hall of Heroes.

The first building, no, a symbol made and raised from spending Lancephil Fief’s finance.

On the giant field of green that spread inside of it, the graves of the comrades who forever entered sleep while fighting for the Lancephil Fief were built.

Ppabam! Ppababam! Ppabam!

The Milta Military Band’s performance reached climax.

The commanders of thousand-man and above rank raised their heads and looked at the front.

The young man standing in front of a grand altar.

The young man who was wearing a crimson uniform and a crimson mantle was Roan Lancephil.

Taking off his military hat and carrying it under an arm, he made a salute.

“I will not let your deaths be in vain.”

The small voice powerfully echoed out.

The Crimson Legion’s soldiers tightly clenched their fists.

Their hearts fiercely burned up.

Looking at the stone surface where the names of the fallen were written fully, Roan added on.

“With your blood, the Crimson Legion has been colored much redder.”

From his entire body, a presence that couldn’t be reached, yet endlessly gentle, flowed out.

“Rest comfortably there. You have the right to do so. And in your instead……”

Roan shouted as if to proclaim.

“We will embrace your blood on our chests and right the continent.”

He spun right around and looked at the Crimson Legion’s soldiers.

“Are you all ready?”

Ready to freely roam the continent together with the fallen comrades.

Without even having to say it, that meaning was delivered.

The Crimson Legion’s soldiers, in a perfect order, kneeled down on one knee.

A perfect sight without a single strand of hesitation or dislocation.

“Yes sir! We shall follow our lord’s order, sir!”

A grand sight.

In front of the incredible pressure and bravery that stormed around his entire body, Roan slightly trembled.

‘Together with them, I can achieve anything.’

His own resolve and certainty increased.

Roan wore the military hat he had held under his arm.

Below the hat, a sharp light flashed from his eyes.

The Crimson Legion’s soldiers, with one knee still kneeled, did not move thoughtlessly.

Seeing Roan taking care of the fallen the foremost, their loyalties had deepen much further.

Furthermore, Roan’s steps weren’t finished with this.

Opening up the fief’s finance, he had provided an incredible compensation and recompense to the families of the fallen.

The dead were dead, and the living were living.

Because majority of places didn’t gave out even a few pieces of coins to the fief’s citizens saying how much could they be to those who lost their loved ones, Roan’s action was something that deserved to receive applause from many people.

In fact, the number of people amongst the fallens’ families who were greatly moved by Roan’s careful considerations and interest wasn’t small.

“Huu.”

Roan, who finished the Fallen Memorial Ceremony, returned to his office and checked the next schedule.

At that moment.

‘Hmm.’

Roan’s sharp and sensitive senses picked up an unpleasant presence.

‘He really is busy.’

Tips of his mouth slightly went up.

Roan’ put down the bundle of papers he was checking, then moved his steps towards a window.

Through the slightly open gap in the window, two small chattering birds were visible.

Paat.

Roan’s hand weirdly moved and quickly snatched one of them.

A fast hand movement that it couldn’t quite escape from.

Chirp. Chirp.

The small bird struggled and tragically cried.

Roan, so that he doesn’t accidentally hurt it, gently grasp the small bird and looked straight at it.

For a moment, an awkward staring contest between a human and a bird continued on.

Chiiiirp.

The small bird now didn’t even cry and instead turned its head this way and that as if to avoid Roan’s gaze.

Finally, Roan made a faint smile.

“Rather than doing this, it’ll be better to directly see faces and talk.”

Words passed to the bird.

It was a sight that one would definitely think that Roan had gone mad if he saw it.

However, Roan was greatly serious.

“Come to my office right now.”

HIs voice was calm.

“Clay.”

Roan brushed the bird’s head once, then released him out of the window.

The small bird circled around the window, then soon flew towards the end of east.

And a moment later.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

A sound of knocking on the office’s door.

“Come in.”

As soon as Roan’s words fell, the tightly closed door cautiously opened.

The one who appeared together with a faint smile was Clay.

He lowered his head towards Roan.

“I have received your summon and came, my lord.”

Clay’s voice was greatly composed.

His expression too was greatly composed.

He didn’t unnecessarily laid out excuses or justifications.

Tips of Roan’s mouth gently went up.

‘Clay.’

The two people’s eyes flashed and shone lights.

As if passing an ordinary greeting, Roan lightly threw his words.

“Did you think I wouldn’t know?’

At those words, Clay faintly smiled and shook his head.

“Would I really have thought so complacently, my lord?”

Answer that asks instead.

The smile that hang Roan’s mouth became much deeper.

“And the reason?”

As expected, words that calmly ask.

Clay stayed silent for a moment and looked at Roan’s eyes.

An awkward and heavy silence.

Finally.

“It was for myself.”

Clay.

He did not unnecessarily said a lie.

“At the same time, it was also for my lord.”

A bold expression and voice.

Roan quietly stared at Clay’s eyes.

The two people’s gazes chaotically tangled and tangled again.

The time flowed slowly and the space shrank.

Like that, the conversation continued on.

Lancephil County (2) End.

Chapter 193




“For me?”

Roan asked back in a composed voice.

Clay nodded his head.

“Since my lord is occasionally obstinate without care to a point of being excessive, sir.”

The point of his words were simple.

There were times when Roan would forget the fact that he was a noble of the kingdom and a lord who was leading tens, hundreds of retainers.

He would raid into the enemy camps like his time as a rank and file spearman and even personally carry out dangerous plans and schemes.

Not only that, there were times when he would move without a single escort like the recent Walter’s event.

Actions that meticulously forgot of his duty as a lord.

“With the worry of whether my lord would encounter some accident, I have been having numerous animals to always guard your surroundings, sir.”

Words saying it wasn’t spying or monitoring.

Roan faintly smiled and shook his head.

“If it was for such a reason, then there shouldn’t have been a need to do so behind my back, no?”

“As I have told my lord before, I have thought that, If it is my lord, he would notice it himself.”

Clay was bold.

In truth, there was a point he was trusting.

‘In the Lancephil Fief right now, there is no individual as definitely necessary as I.”

Currently, Clay was administrating as well as commanding the Lancephil County’s entire administration.

Furthermore, he was even managing the Bureau of Druids.

A situation where there honestly wasn’t a thing that did not pass through his hands.

‘He absolutely cannot throw me away.’

The moment he throw him away, the Lancephil County will lose momentum and end up aground.

‘Furthermore, is the Sir Count not a person who values talented individuals and thoughtlessly throw people awa……’

When his thoughts have reached about that point.

Roan cheerfully smiled and stood up from his seat.

“Clay.”

A softly calling voice.

Clay slightly smiled and lowered his head.

He was still overflowing with confidence.

Roan quietly looked at Clay and spoke in a determined expression and voice.

“Leave.”

A short but shocking word.

“Eh?”

Clay widely opened his eyes.

Because the words he thought could never come from Roan had flowed out.

Roan looked straight into Clay’s eyes.

“I will acknowledge your achievements until now and won’t ask any more of your errors.

Leave. If you wish, you may take all of the druids along.”

It was a final decision.

A decision that absolutely was not easy even from Roan’s position.

The druids and the various species of animals the druids controlled were greatly important strength even to Roan.

Furthermore, the abilities Clay had were also the top of the top.

Roan, tight now, had decided to give up all of them.

“M, my lord……”

Clay blurred the end of his words.

His mind was disarrayed and with his senses flown away, he couldn’t finish his sentence.

At that moment, Roan threw up a long sigh.

“Clay. I greatly recognize your abilities and talent. You are the most outstanding amongst my retainers, no, great enough to be counted within a hand within the kingdom.”

“Then why……”

Although he had done an uncivil act, it wasn’t as if he had done a crime big enough to be chased out.

Roan, effortfully with a composed voice, added on.

“However much your abilities are outstanding, how could I entrust even single small duty to you when there is no trust between you and I?”

“Tha, that is……”

Clay couldn’t easily continue his words.

Roan gently wrapped his hands on Clay’s shoulders.

“Clay. The fact that you are an outstanding and talented individual is something anyone would know of. Leave and go find a master fitting for you.”

It was a beautiful goodbye possible because it was at the least before the Great Warring Era, the age of anarchy had came.

‘If the world was chaotic, I would have slashed his neck instead of chasing him out.’

In the anarchy, one was an enemy if one was not a friend.

If one couldn’t take it, one had to destroy it.

‘Of course, I don’t have any plan to really chase him out right now.”

But Clay simply couldn’t grasp Roan’s such intent.

Because he had greatly panicked at the unexpected words.

‘Truly leave?’

Clay couldn’t come to his senses.

‘Just how did I climb up to here……’

Starting from a rank and file administrator, he had became the head administration manager who led the County.

Furthermore, Roan was the Rinse Kingdom’s new star and one of the nobles with the most influence.

For Clay to make the world he dreamt of, he needed a powerful master like Roan.

‘Just where would I go after leaving here?’

There was none.

AT least within the Rinse Kingdom, there currently was no one who might be comparable to Roan.

To particularly nitpick, marquises who are names only and the four dukes who were outside powers.

‘But those places are basically already finished puzzles.’

There was almost no possibility of Clay squeezing in and taking a high position.

No, before that.

‘Even they are not the lord’s opponents.’

Although the powers of the duke houses might be greater right now, the possibility of growth was much greater for Roan.

In the end, it meant that there wasn’t anyone he could fittingly serve.

‘Then that means I’ll ultimately have to head to a foreign country, but……’

That was problematic on its own.

‘The situations in few kingdoms are disasters, and at places that are a bit good……’

His brothers had taken seat.

Most of all, he didn’t wish to turn his back on his mother nation the Rinse Kingdom.

‘The conclusion is……’

Perhaps it might already had been out from the start.

‘I cannot leave my lord’s side.’

The bold pride fell down.

As the pride fell down, the narrow view widely opened up.

‘It wasn’t that the lord couldn’t throw me away……’

His lips sharply trembled.

‘But rather I couldn’t leave.’

No, to be exact, it was a situation where he couldn’t throw him away, and he couldn’t leave either.

Roan must had knew that.

Despite knowing that he too could greatly get hurt, he didn’t hesitate in thrusting his spear into chaos.

Thanks to that, Roan was able to grasp the higher ground in the current situation.

‘Ah……’

Clay let out a quiet exclamation.

At least this time, he was perfectly tied up by Roan.

But he couldn’t knew.

That the reason Roan could come out forcefully like so wasn’t merely because he had endured his loss and made the decision with a bone-carving feeling.

‘I’m already receiving a big help.’

Roan deeply breathed in.

His heart rapidly raced.

‘Princess. No, Aily. Really thank you.’

Roan’s resolute decision.

That was something only possible because Aily’s help was there.

An incredibly secretive help that even Clay, who was always spying on Roan, couldn’t realize.

‘If there are the elves, there is no need to particularly be tied down to druids’ abilities.’

Humans and elves.

Roan and Aily was preparing for an coexistence that no one had tried before.

When his thoughts had reached about that point.

“My lord.”

Clay kneeled down on one knee and lowered his head.

A look that his disarrayed mind was quickly organized.

As much as his head was good, his decision too was quick.

“I was much too lacking and foolish.”

The end of his voice shook.

It was hard to determine whether it was a truth or a lie.

“Please give me one more chance.”

Completely switched positions.

But even in this while, Clay was setting up tens of plans within his head.

‘Now that it came to this, I’ll look to a higher place.’

He would dominate the fief to a point that Roan won’t be able to do anything if it wasn’t him.

‘And if a chance arises……’

His eyes flashed with a sinister light.

A step backwards to advance two step.

If he could merely stay attached to Roan’s side, he could aim for beyond that at any time.

Clay dismissed today’s humiliation as merely collecting his breath.

A feeling that his heart could only feel slightly better by doing at least so.

Roan quietly stared at such Clay.

‘I knew that you will react like that.’

Laughter filled up to below his chin.

Everything was as he and Aily expected.

‘Did she called it mind’s eyes……’

One of the abilities Aily had.

An ability similar to Kalian’s Tears but slightly different.

Aily’s mind’s eyes that she received from the dragon lords was an ability to see the light that exuded out from people’s body based on their personalities and feelings.

A red for rage, blue for sadness, gold for joy……

Thanks to that, Aily was able to grasp people’s true intents to a degree through the mind’s eyes.

But there very occasionally were ones who were hard to grasp their personalities and feelings of, and Clay was one of those very type of people.

Whenever Aily saw Clay, she could see only one color.

A dark wine light.

‘A foul narcissism.’

A feeling that went beyond pride and confidence.

Clay was a man who loved himself the most in the world.

‘That Clay is meekly stepping back? Ridiculous.’

A feeling of wanting to instantly cut him in a slash if possible.

But the situation was still a one where he had to leave Clay at his side.

It wasn’t merely because his outstanding abilities were regrettable.

‘Three years at the longest. The game board will flip within three years.’

Together with the Great Warring Era, the Rinse Kingdom would greatly shake.

The conclusion to the throne succession competition.

Clay was needed for that moment.

Using Clay, Roan planned to set a board that fitted his taste.

‘Clay. Since you tried to use me……’

The light in his eyes heavily sank.

‘I too will use you from now on.’

With a quiet voice, he called Clay.

“Clay.”

“Yes. My lord.”

Clay acutely lowered his head.

A look of having shrunk his entire body.

It was a look that truth and lies were mixed half and half.

Roan bitterly smiled and spoke in a small voice.

“I deprive you of all your current ranks and appoint you as bottom rank administrator. But I will tell you that advancement will be possible depending on your achievements afterwards. There will be no more loss beyond this.”

Demotion.

And it was an incredible demotion at that where the head manager fell to the bottom.

Uddk.

Clay clenched his teeth.

One excessively arrogant decision had brought much too big of an ordeal.

Even though he had raised many achievements by spying and monitoring Roan, he ultimately fell down again to the bottom.

But.

‘He said that there won’t be any more loss beyond this.’

Roan was of a personality that absolutely followed what he said once.

Clay deeply breathed in.

‘I will definitely return today’s humiliation.’

He effortfully made a smile.

“I will receive your order, my lord. I will do my best more than ever from now on.”

Clay deeply bowed his head.

He didn’t wish for his twisted face to be caught.

However, Roan had already guessed Clay’s heart.

‘Climb up. Clay. Climb up from the bottom to the top and fatten the fief.’

Of course, although that too would merely be for three years at the longest.

Roan and Clay’s gazes complicatedly tangled and intertwined.

The strange company began like that.

While pointing unseen tips of swords at each other.

Of course, although Roan was holding a shield on his opposite hand in his case……

*****

“Oh! So you mean it’s Lancephil County once passing through that gateway?”

A young man pointed with a slightly elated expression.

A middle aged man standing at his side, together with a short sigh, answered.

“That is so, sir.”

The place the two people’s gazes touched was a small gateway located at the end of a road.

The young man, for who knew what was so good, brightly smiled and frivolously moved his steps.

The middle aged man who was watching that sight spoke as if to admonish.

“Even though you are the master of a company that entered within ten fingers in the kingdom, your dignity seem too lacking, sir.”

“What does it matter if it enters within ten fingers. Even though we may end up closing it all if not careful.”

The young man laid out serious stories as if it was nothing.

The middle aged man slightly creased his brows.

“It’s still not at that degree, sir.”

“I know. It’s a joke, a joke. But it’s clear that the situation is difficult.”

The young man was still bright and cheerful.

Looking at the gateway that neared before they noticed, he asked in a small voice as if to whisper.

“Goden. Do you still trust my decision and judgment?”

At those words, the middle aged man, Goden, answered without a single bit of hesitation.

“Of course. Since I’m always on Sir Clyde’s side.”

As soon as his words finished, the young man, Clyde, raised his thumb.

“As expected! There really is only Goden.”

Clyde.

He was the master of Clyde Company’s master who before chose the Third Prince Kallum Rinse at the end of contemplating the prince who would rise to the Rinse Kingdom’s next throne.

“I thought too easily of Sir Count Roan Lancephil. I admit that. But even so, I don’t think my decision to choose Prince Kallum is wrong.”

It wasn’t an excuse.

However much he thought about it, the person who was fit to climb to the next king’s position was only Kallum.

‘Prince Simon is excessively hot-blooded and impetuous. Prince Tommy’s abilities are much too lacking compared to his ambition.’

In the first place, the throne succession competition would had ran with Kallum’s lead if it wasn’t for Roan.

‘If Prince Simon becomes the next king like this with Count Lancephil on his back……”

Not only Kallum, but he who supported him too would not avoid misfortune.

‘I can’t leave it alone to let it be so.’

They said that there was always a hole to rise up even when the sky fell down.

Furthermore, the current situation wasn’t as so tragic either.

‘One year has already passed since Count Lancephil won the fief war.’

People thought that Roan would drive that victory and momentum to finish the throne succession competition.

But actually, Roan left the capital, Miller, and returned to the Lancephil County, then afterwards focused on strengthening his internal affairs without showing any particular actions.

Rather, it looked that the nobles who supported Tommy and Kallum were going out at faction expansion a bit more enthusiastically.

Of course, the one who was standing at the lead in the throne succession competition despite so was Simon.

He, with a reliable backing called Roan, quickly recruited core powers around the capital, Miller.

Roan’s influence was that powerful.

Enough to bring small nobles of the neutral factions to their knees without necessarily moving.

‘Anyhow, we’ve maintained a thin ice-like peace for the last one year, but……’

The current Rinse Kingdom’s situation was where Simon had dominated most of the northern region with the capital, Miller, at the center.

And Tommy and Kallum each split the south of capital, Miller, and were executing their influence.

A situation that maintained an odd balance.

‘But that peace too, that is, is now at an end.’

Because a large event had happened at the capital, Miller, one month ago.

‘His majesty the king suddenly fell down.’

King Deni Von Rinse, who pushed national affairs behind him and repeated banquets almost daily, had suddenly fell down in the middle of the last month.

Although he wasn’t immediately wandering between death, it was a truth that a large variable had appeared in the throne succession competition.

‘Although all three princes still aren’t showing any particular movement……’

It was a situation where it wouldn’t be strange even if something happened whenever and wherever.

In the middle of this, there was a complicated reason Clyde had come to visit Roan.

‘Although it is also to protect our company……’

Clyde unconsciously held his hand on his left chest.

‘I will aim for a grand reversal using this card I have.’

It was an information he gained through all kinds of efforts in the last one year.

That was one of the information that Roan currently wanted the most.

‘News of Io Lancephil……’

Clyde unconsciously swallowed dryly.

The information he had was much more hideous and gruesome than anyone thought.

‘If it goes as planned, I could split Count Lancephil and Prince Simon.’

If it goes well, it would even be possible to recruit Roan into Kallum’s camp.

The information Clyde had was giant and incredible to such a degree.

When his thoughts were getting deeper.

“We’re now passing through the gateway.”

Goden’s voice was heard.

“Hhm? Already?”

Clyde organized his thoughts and looked around his surroundings.

The small gateway was exceedingly clean and strong.

“Anyway, a gateway at not even the national border but at a fief’s border…… isn’t this somewhat excessive?”

At Clyde’s words, Goden faintly smiled and shook his head.

“It probably is because of that last year’s intense fief war. It probably means that he doesn’t wish to experience the same thing two, three times. From what I’ve heard, he has set up big and small gateways along the fief’s border.”

“Anyhow, he really is a meticulous man.”

Clay shook his head.

HIs gaze headed towards the people who were going to and from the gateway.

It was an incredible crowd.

“There’s amazingly a lot of people passing through.”

“Since, as you know, the current center of Rinse Kingdom’s commercial supremacy is, the Lancephil County, sir.”

“Quite a many companies have moved here during last year, right?”

“Since the tax here is much cheaper than other places wherever you look. Because of that, our company’s branch was also built here.”

“Right. Since it’s not only that the tax is cheap but is the base of trade with the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom.”

“The water transportation using the Poskein Lake is also convenient.”

Clyde and Goden’s conversation hit off well.

The two people’s words were all true.

Roan, to make the Lancephil County into a prosperous fief, executed all sorts of economic revival policies.

But before those policies, the numerous companies and big and small businesses Roan himself owned were very prosperous and competitive.

Especially the Montea Mountain’s mana stone mine and the Istel Kingdom’s farmlands were producing colossal profits as cream of the crop businesses. 1

At that moment, the view of Clyde and Goden, who had been quietly chatting, suddenly opened up.

They had finally passed through the gateway and entered into the Lancephil Fief inside of it.

Suddenly, Clyde and Goden’s eyes widely opened.

“Go, Goden?”

“Ye, yes. Sir Clyde.”

The two people fumbled their words with half dazed expressions.

Looks of looking around their surroundings while dryly swallowing.

After who knew how long.

“This place really is Lancpehil County?”

“Yes. That’s definitely correct.”

Goden immediately nodded his head at Clyde’s words.

Suddenly, a giant carriage that tens of people were riding on passed in front of the two people.

It was a carriage two strong horses were pulling, but they didn’t had any looks of being tired.

Clyde, with a sharply trembling voice, muttered.

“This is a completely different world.”

Lancephil County (3) End.

The inside of the gateway was a new world.

But even so, it didn’t mean that it was a world where carriages flew in the sky and were decorated with all kinds of jewels.

“Look at this road.”

The road that widely spread in front of their eyes.

Because it was paved even stones, there was no worry of the ground being dug up even if heavy carriages passed by.

Furthermore, the road carriages and horse carts passed by and the road people walked by were differentiated, so there was absolutely no hindrance in each’s traffic.

“Even though it’s a gateway city at the fief’s border, look at the number of stores.”

Goden was being surprised at a different place.

Shops that were very various to a point where there wouldn’t be anything they didn’t sell were lined up on the road’s side, and they were all clean stone buildings.

“Oh my! That’s Istel Kingdom’s wheat!”

“Look at those gold ornaments.”

“There’s a bunch of good grade mushrooms.”

The people who passed through the gateway naturally moved their steps towards the shops.

Clyde and Goden’s gazes too kept turning, but there was no time for them to take their eyes off.

“Let’s stop by on our way back, sir.”

Clyde nodded at Goden’s words.

Their steps effortlessly headed towards the end of the road.

At that moment.

“Stagecoach to Mediasis leaves soon! People who are going to Mediasis Castle, please purchase the tickets!”

A loud voice.

“Un?”

Clyde and Goden’s gazes naturally moved following the voice.

“Hmm.”

Suddenly, a quiet exclamation flowed out.

At the place their gazes met, a giant carriage tens of people were riding on were seen.

It was that very giant stagecoach that passed in front of the two people the instant they passed through the gateway.

“Just two horses can pull a carriage that big?”

Clyde shook his head with a surprised expression.

Their steps, before they knew it, were leading towards the stagecoach.

When they exited the road and entered into a rather big lot, a scene much more shocking was spread out.

“It’s not just one or two?”

Inside the lot, five sets of giant stagecoaches were parked.

Ten people at fewest, and more than twenty people at the most were getting on.

The number of horses pulling the carriages also changed depending on the size, but however many there were, they never exceeded four.

When Clyde and Goden were looking at each other with surprised expressions.

“Welcome to the Unham Stagecoach Station.”

A young man approached and lowered his head.

“You can purchase the tickets inside, sirs.”

On his left chest, a badge with his name called O’Connor, together with his organization name called Lancephil Transportation Division Unham Coach Station, written on was hanged.

Goden awkwardly smiled and asked about the curious thing.

“Ah, yes. Can we ride that giant carriage all the way to Mediasis Castle if we purchase the ticket?”

“Yes. Of course, sir.”

O’Connor cheerfully smiled and nodded his head.

Clyde, with an expression seemingly suspicious, asked.

“Even though there’s that many people riding on it, could it make proper speed with just two horses?”

At those words, O’Connor answered in a gentle and bold voice as if to say not to worry.

“You must be using our Lancephil Transportation Division’s stagecoaches for the first time. Our stagecoaches are magic carriages that carved Reno Magic Tower’s magic array onto the latest carriages that Lancephil Alchemy Department and the Lancephil Engineering Department have worked together to create.”

“Magic carriages?”

Clyde’s eyes widely opened.

O’Connor lightly nodded his head.

“I don’t know exactly what kind of magics are engraved either, but I heard that magic that reduces the carriage’s total weight and a magic that sets the carriage’s balance are included as standard.”

“Hmm.”

Clyde and Goden once again leaked quiet groans.

‘Although I’ve seen magic to reduce weight many times……’

Research to reduce heavy armors’ weight for application of powerful infantry troop was actively in progress.

In fact, heavy armor troops with weight lessening magic arrays carved on were partially active in Estia Empire and few other kingdoms.

‘I have never thought of grafting that magic on carriage transport.’

Clyde inwardly shook his head and looked at O’Connor.

“How many magic carriages like this are being run?”

“There aren’t that many yet, sir. Even if we include the number of carriages being operated across the entire fief, it should be about a bit over twenty sets. Of course, that number is continuing to grow larger.”

An inconcealable pride was felt in O’Connor’s voice.

Clyde and Goden slowly nodded their heads.

Twenty sets of magic carriages.

That was absolutely not a small number.

‘For a result gained from merely one year, it’s incredible instead.’

In fact, although O’Connor didn’t know of the detailed situation in his case since he was the Transportation Division’s bottom level employee, the Lancephil County was currently repeating brilliant developments under the fief development plan.

Especially the Lancephil’s transportation network that was represented with the magic carriage was participated by not only the Lancephil Alchemy Department, Lancephil Engineering Department, and Reno Magic Tower as well as Lidia Lumber Co. and Ford Mining Co. that were producing the raw materials.

On top of here, the Sale Company that Goldmaster Sale, no, Aily was master of was directly operating the road construction and the Transportation Division together.

In short, it meant the transportation network business was one of the most important businesses amongst the Lancephil County’s development plan.

‘Incredible.’

Clyde inwardly exclaimed greatly.

He knew that the Lancephil County had risen as the Rinse Kingdom’s new center of commercial supremacy.

But he hadn’t expected for it to be completely redoing its infrastructure itself.

‘Count Lancephil may be much more amazing person than I had thought.’

Rather than obsessing over short term results, he was leading the fief with long term insight.

Of course, Roan must not had done all this alone.

But the fact that geniuses who could make such things possible were staying at his side too was an amazing feat.

“Goden. We should also use the stagecoach.”

Clyde cheerfully smiled and signalled with his eyes.

His curiosity arose.

He wanted to personally experience and feel it.

Goden soon nodded his head, then purchased two tickets to Mediasis from a ticket booth inside.

“Please have a pleasant trip.”

O’Connor bowed with a polite posture.

Clyde and Goden lightly nodded their heads, then moved their steps towards the signpost where trip to Mediasis was written on.

On the giant carriage, there were still a few empty seats.

A carriage made with thick and soft cloth as the roof.

When they entered inside, small yet comfortable wooden chairs appeared.

‘Not bad.’

If they could actually carry and transport this many people with just two horses, they would be able to carry and transport goods as well as soldiers in emergencies.

‘Transportation of goods and soldiers become much faster?’

If the transportation network was to be set like this, Lancephil County’s military strength would become tens of times stronger.

Clyde and Goden, sitting opposite of each other, looked at each other’s eyes.

Complicated looks were clear on both people.

At that moment.

“Number 3 Stagecoach to Mediasis is now departing.”

The voice of the driver sitting on the coach box was heard clearly as if he was talking from right next to them.

Simultaneously.

Ggiiig.

Together with a sound of wooden boards twisting, the giant carriage gently began to move.

Clop. Clop.

The two horses, without even a little bit of tired look, powerfully kicked the ground.

The carriage that slowly began to move soon left the Unham Stagecoach Station and entered into a wide road.

Clyde, shining a light from his eyes, looked at Goden.

“The shaking isn’t as harsh as I thought.”

“Like that man named O’Connor said, I believe it’s because balancing magic is also carved.”

Goden immediately answered and raised his sense of touch to the carriage’s movements.

Although it was comfortable without shaking, the speed wasn’t on the very fast side.

“It’s slower than I had thou……”

When his words reached about that point.

The driver’s voice was heard once again.

“We have left the gateway city Unham Village. We will now begin to increase our speed. Please have a comfortable trip.”

The instant his words ended, the speed of the carriage went up.

The one thing that was at least well was that the sense of speed instead greatly went down as the speed went up.

It was to a point that they wouldn’t have realized that the carriage was running if it weren’t for the rough windows that were periodically punctuated.

Clyde and Goden looked at each other and shook their heads.

They now looked too tired to be surprised any more.

“Since a gateway village is this much, how much would the Mediasis Castle be?”

Clyde muttered in a small voice.

When Goden couldn’t answer because he too didn’t have anything he knew of, another merchant cheerfully smiled and answered.

“That place is really a different world. It’s a city where the night view is especially fantastic.”

Night view.

Clyde and Goden creased their brows.

Unfamiliar words.

Did that mean that there was something special to the night’s scenery?

‘It should probably be about putting on few oil lamps at most.’

Even the capital, Miller, was lighting the dark by installing oil lamps in the palace and parts of the main street.

The capital, Miller, that was called the most brilliant and large city in the Rinse Kingdom was about that much level.

‘But……’

Clyde had a feeling of maybe.

From some time onwards, he began to anticipate the unknown from Roan.

Clyde’s chest raced as quickly as the running carriage.

*****

A space that was simple but not crude, and frugal yet not poor.

The Lancephil Lord’s Castle located at the center of the Mediasis Castle was essentially work focused space that only had the essentials.

“Have we still not found any traces?”

The head seat that technically was not a head seat.

Roan, who was sitting at the end of a long circular table, asked with a serious expression.

“I’ve no face, my lord.”

“Apologies, my lord.”

Agens’s President Chris and Tenebra Troop’s Vice-Captain Keep, who were called the Lancephil County’s eyes and ears, lowered their heads with dismal expressions.

Roan exhaled a short sigh.

“Where has godfather gone……”

The person Roan and his numerous retainers were desperately searching for was Io Lancephil.

It was already one year since Io had disappeared.

They found out to the fact that he had left the capital, Miller, and headed towards the Estia Empire during the fief war.

However, they couldn’t figure out the reason he chose the trip to the empire nor his whereabouts since entering the empire.

‘We couldn’t yet stretch our hands all the way to Estia Empire.’

Even though Agens and the Tenebra Troops too had strengthened their internal affairs and increased their sizes, they were still insufficient to collect even the information within the Estia Empire.

Within the last one year of time, Roan strengthened the fief’s internal affairs while searching for Io’s whereabouts on the other hand.

But despite all kinds of efforts, he couldn’t find Io’s trace.

At that moment.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Together with a sound of knocking on the conference room’s door, a sentry showed up.

“Lady Baroness Elva Dionell has come, my lord.”

At those words, the faces of the core retainers including Austin solidly stiffened.

“I’ve come to meet Sir Count.”

Simultaneously, a woman beautiful yet exuding a powerful presence, Elva Dionell, showed herself.

Approximately one year ago, Elva had come to the fief and was staying up to now at the Count’s House as an important guest.

From a glance, it wasn’t a situation with a big problem.

But as the time flew, her status came to the fore as a problem.

When Elva first visited the Lancephil County, she called herself a representative of the youth party nobles’ organization, 12 Hatchlings.

At the time, she requested of Roan to become the 12 Hatchling’s thirteenth member.

However, Roan couldn’t accept that offer since he was chasing the disappeared Io’s whereabouts and strengthening the fief’s foundations.

An indirect refusal.

Then Elva became stubborn and settled down at the Count Lancephil House, but she herself began to confuse her role as the time passed.

Originally, Elva was a noble who supported the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

As she left her seat vacant for a long time, Kallum began to send letters and people to her through various reasons.

He had wished to draw Roan into his camp using Elva.

From this point on, Elva began to wander between her two roles as the representative of the 12 Hatchlings and a person of Kallum’s camp.

Count Lancephil House too fell into a concern that technically wasn’t a concern on how to deal with to her.

“As whose person did you come today, Lady Baroness?”

At Roan’s question, Elva faintly smiled and lowered her head.

“I came as Prince Kallum’s person, Sir Count.”

Quite a bold look today of all days.

‘She seems to be overflowing with confidence today.’

Roan inwardly made a bitter smile.

Although she was an important guest of the house, right now was a conference table that dealt with the Count House’s major issues.

It wasn’t a situation where they could share a talk.

“Baroness Dionell. I apologize but let us talk a bit later since I’m in a conference now.”

At those words, Elva faintly smiled and shook her head.

“Just a moment is fine, sir. I brought a very important news, you see.”

“An important news?”

“Yes. It’s an important news.”

Elva looked straight at Roan’s two eyes.

Roan, looking at that bold and brave light devoid of deceit in her eyes, nodded his head.

“Alright. What news is it?”

At those words, Elva collected her breath for a moment, then answered in a small voice.

“We’ve discovered news of Sir Io Lancephil.”

*****

Neeigh!

The carriage that was running well suddenly stopped.

“We will be momentarily stopping.”

Soon following, the driver’s hurried voice was heard.

Clyde and Goden, who were having a light sleep for a moment, stretched with puzzled expressions.

At that moment, one of the merchants who were looking outside the window shouted with surprised expression.

“It’s the Lancephil Legion’s military truck troop.

A military truck troop.

They were separately called Gale Troop at the Lancephil County, and was a troop newly made together with the magic carriage development.

Dudududududu!

Together with an incredible sound of horsehooves, a cloud of dust rose up around the stagecoach.

“Just what’s happening?”

“For the Lancephil’s military truck troop to suddenly surround us……”

“Is there perhaps Count Chase’s remnant hiding amongst us?”

Scared voices poured out from everywhere.

Clyde and Goden dryly swallowed with slightly nervous expressions.

At that moment, the tightly closed carriage door widely opened.

Simultaneously, a trustworthy looking young man wearing a crimson armor showed himself.

“I’m Gale Troop 1st Squad commander Caldwell. Is Sir Clyde perhaps here?”

Although it was a thunderously ringing voice, the tone of the voice itself was greatly polite.

Clyde, who was sitting at the very back in the carriage awkwardly stood up from his seat.

“I’m Clyde.”

Following that, Goden stood up from his seat and stood in front of Clyde.

A movement that he naturally practiced into his body while aiding Clyde for over thirty years.

Caldwell slightly bowed his head and saluted.

“I’ve came to escort you on the lord’s order. Please board our military truck.”

“Sir Count Lancephil has……?”

Clyde muttered with a slightly shocked expression, then soon nodded his head.

He finally had a rough grasp of how the situation was flowing.

‘So Lady Baroness Dionell spoke up the story first.’

Roan must be wanting to hear the news of Io Lancephil even a moment faster.

Clyde pulled Goden with one hand and climbed off the carriage.

In front of his eyes, a solid and giant military truck colored red was seen.

Although it was a very simple looking shape without a cap or a roof unlike the carriage, it exuded a feeling that it would be much more faster and destructive instead because of a such point.

“Please hook your feet on the floor ring after climbing on, and tightly hold the strap hanging on the side wall.

Together with an explanation, Caldwell personally demonstrated it.

“Yes. Thank you.”

Clyde and Goden, nodding their heads, followed Caldwell and fastened their bodies on the inside of the military truck.

“Please hold tight.”

Caldwell meticulously checked the two people’s state, then held the reins that was longly drooped.

The warhorse that was panting out rough breaths soon raised its head and powerfully cried out.

Neeigh!

When the two warhorses began to dart off, the military truck much smaller than the carriage brushed the ground as if dragged along, no, as if flying.

“Uhugh!”

Clyde and Goden emptily gasped from the wind that struck their ears.

It was a breakneck speed not even comparable to the magic carriage.

Dududududu!

Together with the loud horsehoove sounds, ten sets of military truck crossed the fields.

The destination was Mediasis Castle.

Dodging the wind that hit his face, Clyde lowered his head to the military truck’s below.

It was hard to breathe.

Unconsciously, he grasped his left chest.

“Once I arrive at Mediasis Castle……’

Once Clyde and Goden meet Roan, no, the moment the letter inside his chest pocket is passed to Roan to be exact, the precariously continued peace will meet its end.

Clyde slightly raised his head and looked at the sky.

The sun, before he knew it, was going over to the west and spraying a crimson light.

‘So the world is already starting to be colored in a red light.’

A bitter smile hanged on Clyde’s mouth.

The sunset yellow world would change to bloody red world.

A war they knew of but can’t dodge nor were allowed to avoid.

It was the moment when that prelude was just about the open.

Lancephil County (4) End.

Chapter 195




They raced like the wind.

The speed of Lancephil Legion’s Gale Troop’s military trucks was that fast.

The wide road was cleanly emptied out.

Thanks to that, the military trucks didn’t reduce speed even once until they arrived at the Mediasis Castle.

Although Clyde and Goden didn’t know of its reason, this too was an act possible thanks the warning system, one of Lancephil County’s many systems.

“S, Sir Clyde.”

Goden stuttered his words and pointed in front of them.

Clyde, who had lowered his head to the truck’s below due to the ferocious wind, nimbly raised his head.

Suddenly, his eyes widely opened.

“A castle of light?”

The castle located in the dark was definitely shining brightly.

Caldwell, who was driving the truck, brightly smiled and nodded his head.

“The people who see the Mediasis Castle’s night view all do say that it’s a castle of light as one.”

Voice full of pride.

‘Did they actually mount jewels or something?’

If so, that could be called the most extravagant form in history.

But as they neared the Mediasis Castle, they could tell that that the identity of that light wasn’t a jewel the nearer they became.

“Lamps?”

The two people looked at each other and muttered.

This time again, Caldwell, who was driving the truck, answered shortly.

“They’re magic lamps.”

“Ah……”

Clyde let out a quiet exclamation.

It was magic again.

‘Was there a place that used magic to this extent?’

Clyde soon shook his head.

In the current era, magic was one of the types of extravagant acts.

After the dragons disappeared, the strength of magic, types of magic, and the popularity of magic died down little by little.

‘I thought that only attack magics that are helpful in wars and battles have survived now……’

He thought there was no noble or influential houses who would patron and support magic that couldn’t be immediately helpful to fighting.

Even just Clyde had no single magic tower he was separately paying attention to and sponsoring.

When his thoughts had reached about that point.

Paat!

One of the magic lamps that was lighting the castle wall lit up the military truck troop.

Clyde and Goden were of slightly panicked expressions at the stream of light that suddenly poured down.

However, Caldwell’s expression was greatly calm.

“Raise the flag!”

At the full voice, a troop flag soon soared up above the military truck that was running at the head.

Gale Troop 1st Squad.

A flag communicating the squad’s association.

It was a flag that didn’t exist in the past.

It was one of the changes that followed the troop organization system reorganizing that took place in the past one year.

Kuung.

There was no more confirmation procedure.

The stream of light that poured down disappeared and the tightly closed castle gate gently opened.

A perfect cooperation.

The group of military trucks didn’t stop and went through the castle gate.

Simultaneously.

“Ah……”

Even though they resolved to not be surprised, Clyde and Goden couldn’t help but burst out in exclaims once again.

A new world opened up in front of their eyes.

‘Right, the words that merchant said back then……’

He remembered the words of the merchant he met on the magic carriage.

That place is really a different world. It’s a city where the night view is especially fantastic.

He felt that he could understand those words’ meaning.

Simultaneously, of why many people including himself called the Mediasis Castle the castle of light.

“Goden. It looks like there’s no night in the Mediasis Castle.”

“Th, that seems to be so, sir.”

Goden nodded his head at Clyde’s words.

The scenery that spread in front of their eyes.

On the grand street that starts from the castle gate they just passed through to the center, tall lamp posts were located on each side.

The lamps that were pouring out white lights were perfectly pushing out the city’s darkness.

Below that, countless residents of the castle were enjoying strolls and sharing chats.

It was a completely different sight than the other fiefs where everyone all returned into their homes when the sun fell.

Caldwell slowly parked the military truck.

“We will have to ride a carriage from here on, sirs.”

Because the transit of military trucks was forbidden inside the castle.

“Yes. I understand.”

Clyde and Goden untied the rings they hooked their feet in and climbed down from the military truck.

As if it had been waiting, a carriage showed up.

It truly was a perfect and faultless sight.

The three people rode the carriage together and headed towards the Lancephil Lord’s Castle.

Clyde and Goden were mindlessly busy sightseeing the Mediasis Castle’s sight that spread outside the carriage.

Looks that even forgot how important a mission they were responsible for right now.

In truth, the sight inside the castle wasn’t something unique or marvelous.

But it merely was that the sight of stone buildings below the magic lamps shining twinkling lights were beautiful enough to lose one’s mind.

“This place really is a different world.”

Clyde unknowingly muttered with a half-dazed expression.

The world outside the Lancephil County was a battlefield of survival where every day was intense.

There was no place as relaxed and peaceful as here anywhere else.

‘Would that difference widen further now? Or……’

Would it all turn into hell whether here or the world outside.

His heart felt frustrated when he thought of the things that would happen from now on.

At that moment, the carriage that had been running nonstop slowly decreased its speed.

The scenery beyond the window also changed.

“It’s the lord’s castle, sirs.”

The lord’s castle.

They had entered Roan’s residence.

Caldwell soundlessly smiled, then opened the carriage door.

An expression that almost seemed to say that his small duty was all over with this.

Suddenly, the scene outside the door entered his eyes in a glance.

“Ah…… Sir Count Lancephil……”

Clyde unknowingly froze like a stone statue.

The young man standing in front of the carriage.

He definitely and certainly was Roan Lancephil.

‘Was he that big?’

A feeling of his airway suffocating in an instant.

He remembered the first time he met Roan in the past at the capital, Miller.

‘He’s different than back then.’

Even though the thought that he wasn’t an ordinary individual also passed his mind back then, it wasn’t as much as now.

‘Although a thought that I might be able to take him on if I use my full force passed my mind back then……’

Now was a degree where he couldn’t even dare to meet his gaze.

“Sir Clyde. It has been a while.”

A gentle but powerful voice.

Roan’s heart was urgent, but even so, he did not err in courtesy.

“Ah, yes. It has been a while, sir.”

Clyde effortfully smiled and once again lowered his head.

Roan lightly greeted Goden who was standing at the side, then took out the main topic.

There was no more leisure to wait.

“Where is my godfather?”

At those words, Clyde deeply breathed in, then took out a thick envelope from his left chest pocket.

With both hands, he politely extended the envelope.

“Please see it directly.”

Roan looked down for a moment at the envelope, then gently extended his hand.

Tap.

The tip of his fingers touched the envelope.

Every person who was standing there dryly swallowed.

They were all instinctively feeling it.

That the precariously continued era of peace would end the moment that envelope opened.

*****

“Your majesty. I’m sorry.”

Duke Francis Wilson, one of the Rinse Kingdom’s four dukes and the one who supported the current king Deni Von Rinse from the back, lowered his head with grave expression.

“Don’t lower head that much. Since it’s not something you did wrong.”

A dry voice.

Deni III, who was lying down on a sickbed, effortfully smiled.

Francis was kneeling near the sickbed.

“I will safely keep hold of the royal family’s crest and the national seal.”

“Yes. That should be better.”

Deni III slowly nodded his head.

An enfeeble look was clear on his face.

“So it’s not that my body got destroyed from the wild lifestyle until now?”

Even though it was a question he already asked a number of times, he wanted to ask again.

Likewise, even though he had said the same answer number of times already, Francis once again answered clearly without an annoyed look.

“Yes, your majesty. Although we can’t tell the kind, you have definitely been poisoned.”

“Hmm.”

Deni III leaked a groan.

Once again, he took out the question in his heart.

“And you can’t tell who the culprit is?”

Francis could only say the same answer.

“I’m sorry, your majesty. We cannot tell at the current time.”

Even though he had stealthily searched the route of poison through various directions, there was not one thing that was clearly revealed.

For a moment, a heavy silence spun.

After who knew how long, Francis effortfully smiled and opened his mouth.

“Even so, there were doctors and priests’ diagnosis that there is no danger to life. You should be able to instantly shake it off and stand up if your majesty takes care of your health well.”

They were words said with deceit just to comfort the complicated and gloomy heart.

In fact, Deni III merely lost his strength and wasn’t at the edge where life was precarious.

Only, the fact that they couldn’t find out the one who played foul on him was the biggest problem.

‘Me, who is a duke of the kingdom, can’t even catch the tail of the mastermind.’

It meant that, at the very least, the identity of the mastermind was of his influence or higher.

Because of that, Francis discussed with Deni III and decided to move the royal family’s crest and the national seal to a safe place.

‘It’s merely a work in case of the very unexpected, in case of the event that might just happen.’

Francis himself too tried not to hold a big meaning to moving the crest and the national seal.

At that moment, Deni III looked up at the ceiling with empty eyes and called Francis.

“Francis.”

“Yes. Please speak.”

Francis quickly lowered his head.

Deni III hesitated for a moment, then very arduously added on.

The question he wanted to ask multiple times but couldn’t quite ask.

“It’s not something my children did, right?”

The First Prince Simon Rinse, the Second Prince Tommy Rinse, the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

A suspicion that they had become blinded by the next generation’s throne and fed poison to their father.

It was a suspicion that he didn’t even want to think of.

Francis couldn’t easily answer.

He gritted his teeth.

He couldn’t confidently say the words ‘no, absolutely no, your majesty, there was no such event’.

There weren’t many people stronger than his faction.

The three princes were included amongst that not so large a number.

“Right. You said that you can’t tell at the current time.”

Deni shook his head with a hollow look.

Francis quietly watched that sight, then slowly stood up.

“Your subject Francis Wilson. I will be back soon, your majesty.”

“Yes. Do come back soon.”

It wasn’t an evasion.

He planned to move the royal family’s crest and the national seal for now and return.

Francis’s steps leaving the king’s bedroom were heavy yet fast.

But in the future, Francis would end up repeatedly regretting this decision today.

Because history began without even himself knowing and demanded someone’s sacrifice.

******

He was calm.

Clyde and Goden thought Roan would slam down on the table and scream out in rage.

But he was truly calm.

Roan put down the envelope and then deeply breathed in.

“Are you fine, my lord?”

Austin asked with a careful voice.

Roan tapped the envelope with a tip of his finger, then looked straight at Clyde.

The light in his eyes were fierce.

“Is he truly safe?”

“Yes. For now…… he is, sir.”

Clyde hesitated for a moment, then nodded his head.

“Huu.”

Roan instead let out a long sigh.

“So my godfather is held in the Holy Palace……’

At the quietly muttered words, the retainers all lowered their heads with subdued expressions.

The Holy Palace.

If just looking at the size, it was a place smaller than the Rinse Palace.

However, the influence they had could be said to be the continent’s greatest.

The headquarter of Ruth Faith that the empire and the kingdom both chose as national faith and the order that ruled over the entire world’s Ruth Faith devotees.

Although they were located within the Estia Empire, their independent status was recognized.

In short, it was a place not even the empire’s breath touched.

It was not strange that Agens and the Tenebra Troop couldn’t find Io Lancephil’s whereabouts.

Rather, the fact that Clyde, who was a mere merchant, found out the news inside the Holy Palace was an incredible feat.

‘Since Clyde Company’s roots are originally said to be in the Estia Empire……’

Furthermore, although the amount was small, they were said to be delivering goods to the Holy Palace.

“He went at Prince Simon’s order……”

Roan muttered in a small voice.

Clyde, whose ears were good, immediately nodded his head.

“Yes sir. Prince Kallum has confirmed that part.”

“Have you not discovered the reason, sir?”

“Yes. We couldn’t find out the reason Sir Io Lancephil went to the Holy Palace. But the fact that the mood at the Holy Palace isn’t good is certain, sir.”

Clyde answered in a careful voice.

However much Kallum and Clyde flew and crawled, they couldn’t find out even the fact that Simon needed the Holy Palace’s God’s Medicine.

Roan slowly nodded his head, then placed the envelope inside his chest pocket.

“It seems I will have to directly ask Prince Simon of that part.”

“A, ask Prince Simon?”

Clyde asked with a slightly surprised expression.

He hadn’t known that Roan might react as quickly like this.

“If you wish, Prince Kallum could look for it, sir.”

He poured out the words he prepared at once.

He planned to give favor and make him carry a debt.

However, Roan faintly smiled and shook his head.

“No. Even without this, I was planning on having a meeting with Prince Simon. There are various things I need to ask him, you see.”

The light in his eyes coldly sank.

“I apologize, but please empty the seat for a moment.”

“Eh? T, that’s……”

Clyde fleetingly glanced at Elva.

Elva slightly nodded her head.

“Sir Count. We too wish to involve……”

When her words reached about that point.

“Baroness Dionell.”

A quietly calling voice.

Light in his eyes that sank even colder.

Gulp.

Elva unconsciously twitched and trembled.

‘There shouldn’t be a need to unnecessarily make petty trouble.’

Although regrettable, now was a time to step back.

Elva signaled at Clyde and Goden with her eyes, then exited out of the conference room.

Clyde and Goden too couldn’t endure any further and followed Elva’s back after politely giving adieu.

Roan, after feeling the presence outside the door, turned towards Austin and Semi, Harrison and Chris, Keep and Brian, and so on.

“We’re going to the capital, Miller.”

A short order.

Austin asked in lieu of everyone.

“Should we ready for march?”

All retainers dryly gulped.

Lead a legion-size force and charge towards the capital.

If not careful, they could receive a crime of treason.

Roan shook his head.

“Only Harrison, Keep, Brian and I are going.”

“It’s too dangerous, sir.”

Chris immediately went out in opposition.

Roan nodded his head.

He too was being careful to not act rashly himself through the conversation with Clay in the past.

“I plan to separately take five hundred Taemusas and Tenebra Troop’s troopers.”

No, to be exact, he planned to make them follow behind secretly, very secretly.

At the order that fell following, the retainers exhaled held breaths and lowered their heads.

“Yes, my lord. We will prepare them as your order.”

The situation advancing rapidly without a pause.

Meanwhile, Elva, Clyde, and Goden, who went out of the conference room, were of fraught feelings of their own.

‘For now, we have to send a letter to Prince Kallum.’

The situation was changing suddenly.

So that Kallum could prepare ahead of time, they had to report the events that were happening in the Lancephil Fief.

But in actuality, the sudden disaster that could flip the world and for both the sky and land to shake exploded in the capital, Miller.

“Urgent news! Urgent news!

Four days later, an agent of Agens raced up with urgent expression to Roan and his party who were about to start towards the capital, Miller.

The agent raced like the wind and kneeled down on one knee in front of Roan.

He, towards the people whose puzzled looks were obvious, screamed at the top of his throat.

“His Majesty the King’s Ascension!” 1

A thunder like sound and thunderbolt like shock.

Everyone’s faces stiffly froze.

The agent once again lowered his head and shouted at the top of his throat.

“His Majesty the King has ascended!”

The sudden change began from the capital, Miller.

Sudden Change (1) End.

Chapter 196




‘Ascension?’

Roan’s face stiffly froze.

It wasn’t something possible.

No, he thought it was something that wasn’t possible.

‘Even though the king died after promoting the Third Prince Kallum to the throne and moving back from the front?’

It definitely happened so in the last life.

Since the First Prince Simon Rinse was seized by madness and became the Mad Monarch in that process.

When everything awoke including the sleeping memories after the hexers’ assault, there was no way that only that memory was incorrect.

‘Of course……”

The fact that the current King Deni Von Rinse had bad health in the twilight of his life was a truth.

Even Roan, who was a rank and file spearman at the time, had heard the rumor once before that Deni III was living a sickbed life for quite a long time.

Therefore, he thought that was plentily possible even when he heard the news this time that Deni III fell down and was recuperating.

‘But an ascension so suddenly?’

The countless memories and information of the last life whirled inside his head like a storm.

Death of the king.

This was not a usual kind of big event.

‘What happened in the last life after the king has died……?’

He fumbled through his memories.

Suddenly, a chilly look floated up on his stiffly frozen expression.

‘Byron and Istel……’

The two kingdoms moved.

It wasn’t really because of Deni III’s death and the Mad Monarch Simon’s rampage was the bigger reason, but based on the time period, the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom raised their armies after Deni III had died.

‘Perhaps this time as well?’

Based on the experiences he went through until now, he couldn’t discount such possibility.

The future that was same as the one he knew, the future that was subtly different, the future that didn’t exist, and the future that disappeared.

Which future would the world that would unfold beyond Deni III’s death be one of?

His thoughts became deeper.

At that moment.

“My lord. Will it be alright to head to the capital, Miller, like this?

Austin asked with a cautious expression.

Harrison added on.

“As the situation is so, I think there will be a limit with just the Taemusas and the Tenebra Troop’s troopers, my lord.”

“He is right. Since his majesty the king has ascended at a situation when the Grand Duke of Grain still hasn’t been decided, something, whatever it may be, will definitely happen, my lord.”

“A bloody wind could blow in the capital, Miller.”

Numerous stories flowed out.

But their connection was one.

It was dangerous as now.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“We will reorganize the entire legion. Make full preparations so that we can march at any time.”

Austin dryly swallowed at those words.

“Will we be going to the capital, Miller, my lord?”

Nervous looks were obvious on everyone.

Roan slowly shook his head.

“There is a work we must do before that.”

There was a need to check which future the world, the world that would spread out from now on, was one of.

His gaze headed towards Chris and Keep.

“Turn all available members of Agens and Tenebra Troop towards the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom.”

“Ah……”

A long explanation wasn’t particularly needed.

Everyone, together with quiet exclamations, nodded their heads.

There was no way that the enemy nations would simply watch the incredible chaos called the king’s death.

Roan’s gaze naturally headed towards the northeastern region.

‘I will have to hope that my guess is wrong……’

The Lancephil Fief’s citizens had only now healed the wounds of the last year’s fief war and regained peaceful daily lives.

No one including Roan wished for the Lancephil Fief to once again become a battlefield.

“Yes sir! We will carry out the order, sir!”

Soon, Chris and Keep gave salutes and then went inside the lord’s castle.

Since a new mission was given, now was a time to busily move.

A south wind violently blew.

*****

“Your highness prince. There is no more time to delay.”

“We have to first acquire, no, calm the palace for now.”

“That is correct. Everyone is feeling apprehensive right now.”

“The one who was originally standing furthest at the lead in the throne succession competition is your highness the prince. Your highness the prince entering the palace the foremost is right.”

The nobles who fully filled the conference room raised their veins.

The place the excited voices and gazes headed was the head seat of a long table.

It was the place the First Prince Simon Rinse was sitting on.

“Your highness the prince. The many nobles’ words are correct.”

“Now is the time your highness must move.”

His closest aide nobles such as Tio Ruin and Delph Blick whispered in small voices.

“Hmm.”

Simon exhaled a long sigh with a solidly stiffen expression.

He, with flaring and fierce light in his eyes, looked at Tio.

“Viscount Ruin. My father the king’s health wasn’t serious even when I greeted him just days ago. And that my father the king suddenly passed away?”

His voice was cold.

He looked around at the numerous nobles and added on.

“I simply can’t seem to understand that.”

Rather than feel sad, Simon filled up with rage at the news that his father Deni III had died.

If a little more time had passed like before, he would have been named the Grand Duke of Grain.

He would finally become the Rinse Kingdom’s crown prince.

But as Deni III suddenly died, everything became disrupted.

‘It absolutely isn’t a natural death. This is definitely an assassination. I’m not sure who it is, but how dare him block my path.’

The individuals that immediately floated up in his mind were his brothers the Second Prince Tommy Rinse and the Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

His reasons, together with rage, turned hazy.

At that moment.

“Prince. Please analyze the situation cool-headedly.”

Tio advised with an urgent voice.

“You must enter the palace first before anyone else. You will be able to find out everything of what had happened to his majesty the king if you were to only enter the palace.”

At those words, Simon came back to himself a moment late.

The killing intent on his eyes gently disappeared.

‘I almost made a mistake at an important moment again.’

It became more and more difficult to control his consciousness and personality these days.

Simon deeply breathed in.

The inside of his head became a little clearer.

“Alright. Everyone get ready. We are going to the palace.”

An order made with a powerful voice.

“Yes! Understood, your highness!”

The nobles instantly stood up from their seats and answered in loud voices.

On the faces that were exiting the conference room, some fervent desires were floated up.

‘It’s done. The time to fly has finally come.’

‘I should go up a status at least by one.’

‘I hope he would increase my fief……’

Imagining the crumbs that would fall down when Simon become the king, they formed foul smiles.

Tio stayed at the conference room until all the nobles went out.

“Prince.”

A very secretive voice.

Simon, who was about to exit out the conference room, paused and stood his place at Tio’s call.

“What is it?”

An unpleased voice.

Tio unnecessarily took a look around the surroundings, then exhaled a short sigh.

“However it is, I think it would be difficult to hide the truth from Count Lancephil any further, your highness.”

“Is this about Sir Io Lancephil?”

Simon’s face solidly stiffened.

Boom!

He slammed down on the table with both hands.

“Damn it. I just don’t understand it! Holy Palace those insane bit……”

“Please watch your words. Your highness the prince.”

Tio quickly cut off Simon’s words.

Simon effortfully calmed his breath and then shook his head.

“However I think about it, there is no reason for the Holy Palace to detain Sir Io. If they don’t want to hand me the God’s Medicine, they can simply refuse.”

“That certainly is so.”

Tio nodded his head with a bitter expression.

He added on with a secretive voice.

“Could someone perhaps had made a move?”

“To capture Sir Io?”

Tio wordlessly nodded his head when Simon asked back.

It was something plenty possible.

Simon reflexively asked.

“Did Tommy and Kallum have connections to the Holy Palace?”

“Since their personal connections are various, there shouldn’t not be one, your highness.”

“Hmm.”

Simon, together with a groan, bit his lower lips.

Even if he were to reveal who had separately made a move, it was a useless act.

“How about instead truthfully telling Count Lancephil at least now……”

Tio blurred the end of his words and searched Simon’s mood.

Simon soon shook his head.

“No, I can’t do that. Since the one who sent Sir Io to the Holy Palace was me either way. And the one who tightly hid that for one year was also me. Even while knowing that Count Lancephil was searching for Sir Io that much.”

Even worse, a disgusting scheme to hold Io as a hostage was also included amongst the reasons he sent him to the Holy Palace.

It was better to instead hide it to the end as long as possible.

At the same time, he had to safely return Io who was caught in the Holy Palace.

Only then could he tie Roan to his side as according to the first plan.

Simon still believed so.

“For now, be careful as much as possible so that the information doesn’t leak out.”

He gave a useless order to Tio.

The two people completely didn’t know the truth that Roan had already found out Io’s whereabouts and the story hidden on the other side.

“Yes, your highness. I will do my best.”

Tio lowered his head.

A look that didn’t seem confident for some reason.

Simon tapped such Tio’s shoulder and widely opened his chest.

“Viscount Ruin. Open your shoulders. This isn’t the time to be dispirited like that.”

Voice that spoke effortfully energetic.

“Should we go to the palace?”

The steps he put out were also bold.

Tio looked at that sight for a moment, then halfheartedly moved his steps.

At least until this time, they did not quite know.

That each step and step they were walking were leading to a foul swamp.

*****

“Kukuk. I see, so he finally moved.”

“Yes. He has entered the palace.”

A dark secret room.

Eleven men were gathered at a table and were conversing.

Amongst them, the one who was seated at the head seat was one of the Rinse Kingdom’s four dukes and Simon’s maternal grandfather, Bradley Webster.

An unconcealable glee was floated up on his face.

“Simon. Whomever he takes after, he’s simply too sluggish. He probably would have lost the lead already to the other bastards if I hadn’t used my hands ahead of time.”

At those words, one of the ten nobles spoke in a furtive voice.

“The one thing certain is that he doesn’t take after Sir Duke. Even though he would already be a king if he took after Sir Duke…… kuk.”

“That is true.”

“He completely takes after his father’s house rather than his mothers. That idiotic Rinse House’s blood……”

Contumely and haughty words popped out as if they were nothing.

Even worse, Bradley made satisfied expression at those words.

At that moment, Viscount Lapa Kathers, who was one of his close aides, burst out a laughter.

“Kuk. But he did send even that Io old man to the Holy Palace saying he’ll do something.”

At those words, Viscount Billy Contess, who also was one of the close aides, clapped his hands and delighted.

“Right. He did do that. Then what’s he going to do, when we already played a hand even at the Holy Palace. Kukuk.”

“God’s Medicine? Something like that, we would already have gotten him that a long time ago if we wanted. Our Sir Duke and Holy Emperor’s relationship is so close.”

Lapa laughed and echoed.

Bradley, who was sitting still and listening to the nobles’ conversation, quietly waved his hand.

Instantly, the noisy secret room turned silent.

“Now, do stop the chatters about here. So what is Simon doing now?”

At those words, the noble who first passed the news of entering the palace cheerily smiled and answered.

“He collected the king’s corpse and has sent letters telling his brothers to enter the palace.”

As soon as the words finished, a round of laughter burst out from everywhere.

“What collecting the corpse. They won’t know however much they look, you know? Just how furtive do they think our methods are.”

Shocking stories came out.

Deni III’s death, they were behind it.

Furthermore.

“Kukukuku. It’s exactly as we expected.”

“Tommy and Kallum should also move as we expected, right?”

“Of course. They’ll never enter the palace.”

“What kind of insane kid walks into a tiger’s den on his two feet?”

Voices full of certainty.

“Even they would never do something like entering the palace if they have a thought.”

Bradley thinly closed his eyes as he formed a peculiar smile.

“The probability of Tommy and Kallum, who are at the kingdom’s south, entering the palace as Simon’s request is basically none. Rather, the chance of openly raising a flag of revolt on Simon since the situation became like this is high.”

“It’s exactly the situation we want.”

Lapa bloodily smiled and echoed back.

Bradley leaned his back on his chair and spat out a long sigh.

“It took truly a long time to come all the way here.”

A period of waiting whose end he couldn’t tell.

Even worse, that period wasn’t a time only Bradley had felt alone.

“The wish of our house that has continued on since father’s, and grandfather’s time.”

A deeply moved expression and voice.

The ten nobles who sat around the table tightly clenched their fists.

“Our Webster house is more fitting to be the royal family than that idiotic Rinse House, sir.”

“So the wish that’s continued on since the grandfathers’ time would finally see the light now.”

The ten nobles.

They were all from Duke Webster House’s branch families and were either close or distant blood relatives.

“We only need to do the end well. Just the end……”

Bradley deeply breathed in.

“Now we only need to egg Simon to attack Tommy and Kallum and make them bloodily fight each other.”

A sharp killing intent was rubbed on his voice.

“Simon will ultimately end up winning. But the kingdom will fall into misery from the three princes’ throne succession war.”

Lapa added on the final words.

“The kingdom’s citizens will step up to denounce Simon. And at that very moment……”

“The bastard’s evil mana explodes! Is this not it?” 1

Billy shouted with a completely elated expression.

Bradley nodded his head.

“Yes. Simon will be caught by the evil mana and become a mad tyrant, and the kingdom’s citizens will suffer even further.”

For this day, for this situation, he taught that very forbidden mana technique to him since he was young.

Elated looks were clear on the nobles’ faces.

Bradley’s story reached climax.

“At that moment, I, with the heart of a grandfather, with a feeling of shedding bloody tears, will step up to punish the grandson and a tyrant Simon for the kingdom and its citizens.”

“Kuuh!”

Numerous nobles couldn’t endure and revealed their elated hearts.

The tips of their mouths were all hanging on their ears.

“In the end, Simon will have his neck cut on my hands and the throne will become empty. The citizens’ anger towards the Rinse Royalty will have reached its apex and will want a new person to lead them.”

Furthermore, a situation where there would be no direct bloodline of the Rinse House to continue the throne due to the throne succession war’s impact.

Bradley ended his words and gently stared at all nobles’ eyes.

The tips of his eyes and mouth sharply trembled.

“The royal family of the new era, of the new kingdom is……”

Boom!

Bradley slammed the desk with his palm.

“Our Webster House.”

A sickening and hideous truth.

Bradley and the Webster House.

They were behind the Rinse Kingdom’s sudden change.

For the house’s wish that continued on for tens of years, they had been hiding razor-sharp talons.

Bradley abruptly stood up from his seat.

“We too will go to the palace.”

The nobles all stood up from their seats.

Bradley, standing in front of the secret room’s door, shone a sharp light from his eyes.

“Although we enter the palace with status of guests for now, the next time……”

The smile hanging on his cheeks became much deeper.

“We will enter the palace as owners.”

Sudden Change (2) End.

Chapter 197




The entire Rinse Kingdom was engulfed in war.

The First Prince Simon Rinse.

The Second Prince Tommy Rinse.

The Third Prince Kallum Rinse.

The three princes pointed their swords at each other.

A tragedy of kindred feud.

The three camps, with the capital, Miller, at the center, repeated fierce battles.

And at the kingdom’s northeastern region slightly afar from there.

At that place, a battle of completely different character was unfolding.

“Kuk!”

“Uak!”

Bitter and gruesome throes of death echoed the battlefield.

Bloodred steel swords bisecting the heads and the chests.

Solid horse hooves trampling the chests of barely breathing soldiers.

The fiercest battle under the sky.

But the most one-sided battle was unfolding on a riverside field.

“Damn it! This is ridiculous! Ridiculous!”

A middle-aged man wearing a brilliant armor was shouting as he swung a longsword.

A rage-filled roar.

He simply couldn’t accept the situation unfolding in front of his eyes.

Two kingdoms against one kingdom.

Even still, the situation of that one kingdom was not even sound.

He thought that it was a war with an obvious result.

“I thought it would be different at least this time……”

The light in his eyes were hollow.

The rage disappeared and a despondent look floated up.

Brutally falling allied soldiers.

Beyond them, soldiers wearing crimson armors were running riot like evil spirits.

“So even the soldiers are ghosts in the Crimson Legion.”

Sage Celuman, one of the Istel Kingdom Army’s generals and one who held the status of a baron, tightly clenched his teeth.

“Even if I die when I die, I’ll die after cutting one more of you bastards’ throats.”

Sound spat out like gnawing each and every letter.

At that moment.

“That would be problematic.”

From the edge of his ears, a quiet and soft but powerful voice was heard.

Sage instinctively turned his head and swung his sword.

Clang!

A spark flew together with a metallic sound.

“Hgh.”

Suddenly, an incredible presence choked his breath.

‘Just what……’

Between the arduousness, he forcefully clenched his teeth and glaringly opened his eyes.

“Ah……”

A dispiriting feeling.

“You, you are……”

At the place his sight stuck.

At the place his horse’s head led towards, a young man suited with a crimson armor and a crimson cloak stood.

The vanguard of the crimson wave and the owner of the Crimson Legion.

The man who anyone would tremble at if one was of the Istel Kingdom Army.

Roan Lancephil the Crimson Ghost.

He, while slantly holding the black Travias Spear, was pouring out an incredible presence.

“Uuuuh.”

Sage trembled while clenching his teeth.

His heart wanted to immediately swing his sword and cut Roan’s neck.

However, his hands and feet froze and couldn’t do anything.

‘A, are you telling me that I, Sage Celuman, got scared?’

A situation he didn’t wish to believe.

He was not such a coward.

He was a fierce warrior who would unhesitantly go out to the final duel even if his neck got cut from lack of his skill.

Sage, clenching his teeth, glared at Roan with bloody eyes.

That was the only thing he could do.

Roan, calmly looking at Sage’s such gaze, formed a faint smile.

‘The binding hex is being quite a help.’

A satisfying and proud feeling.

In truth, there was a reason why Sage couldn’t move his body that he couldn’t know of.

Roan had performed the hex he effortfully trained and honed for the last one year as a surprise attack.

A thing categorized as basic binding hex, it had the effect of momentarily paralyzing the body.

And when Roan’s pressure and presence was added here, even a heavyweight of Sage’s level could only be caught by the spell unless one defended oneself in advance.

‘Since there is no one who knows that I’m using hexes.’

Preparing for hexes in advance was illogical.

Roan lightly swung the spear he held.

Ssskuk!

The sharp spearhead cut Sage’s neck.

A hollow death.

One Taemusa who was following along at this side stabbed Sage’s neck with the tip of his spear and then raised it up high.

“The lord has cut off the enemy general’s head!”

“Waaaaaah!”

Instantly, cheers exploded out from every direction.

“Uuuuh.”

“Ru, run!”

“Run!”

“They’re ghosts! Ghosts!”

The Celuman Troop fell apart into pieces and began retreating in defeat.

Roan, without hesitating, gave the order for chase.

“Chase them! Do not send back the invaders sound!”

Only when they indisputably trampled and crush them could they not come and attack again.

Roan personally led the soldiers on the front line.

It was different than the carefree commanding of his rank and file soldier time that Clay worried so much of.

It was the commanding of a great general that raised up the morale and the spirits of the soldiers below him.

Already, there was no one on this battlefield who could endure Roan’s skills.

He was the sole predator of this expansive battlefield.

The Istel’s small and frail deers ran and ran again dodging Roan.

Of course, even though they would be swallowed by the tsunami-like crimson wave even so.

*****

“Die!”

“You die instead!”

Bloody roars rode the wind and flowed.

On an afternoon that hot southern winds blew, the plain that shone with emerald light began to be colored blood red.

Simon Rinse.

Tommy Rinse.

The two princes’ armies clashed at Stellon Castle located at the southwest of the capital, Miller.

The Stellon Castle was a place that supported Tommy since long before.

Tommy was confident that he could employ the sturdy Stellon Castle as a shield and repel Simon.

But when the battle actually began, the war situation flowed differently than he had though.

“Damn it! To think Simon’s skills were this good.”

Tommy harshly emptied his wine cup together with a curse.

“Kuugh.”

A pungent fragrance rode his throat and climbed up.

“P, prince. Even so, drinking on the battlefield is……”

One amongst the commanders stepped up to remonstrate.

The faces of nearby nobles bleached white.

As expected.

“This bitch dares!”

Tommy pulled out a longsword just like that and slashed the neck of the commander who raised a protest.

“Gurruk.”

An absurd death.

It was a dog’s death.

‘He’s doing it again.’

‘Just who would want to stay at his side like this……’

Few nobles lowered their heads and exhaled short sighs.

In fact, the nobles who followed Tommy, after the three princes began the war over the throne, began to slowly hold their swords backwards as time passed.

Putting aside the fact that his abilities were deficient compared to his ambition, it was because Tommy’s personality was cruel and supercilious.

‘I should also rethink once more around now.’

‘Prince Tommy is hopeless.’

‘He’s already started to be pushed back even by Prince Kallum.’

Schism.

Cracks were forming in Tommy’s camp from the very bottom.

“What happened with Duke Voisa?”

Tommy, knowing or perhaps not knowing such mood, looked for his maternal grandfather Duke Edwin Voisa.

The nobles reacted timorously and couldn’t easily answer.

“I asked if he’s here yet!”

In the end, Tommy exploded once more.

“N, not yet, your highness.”

“Duke Voisa is still on standby at his fief, your highness.”

“He is waiting for his firstborn Mills Voisa.”

The nobles flinched and quickly poured out words.

Tommy huffed and breathed deeply, then once again emptied his cup.

“Kuugh. I see. So he is still waiting. Still waiting……”

He didn’t like it.

If he could, he wanted to immediately throw him onto his knees and cut his neck whether maternal grandfather or not.

But to flip the current unfavorable war situation, he was absolutely needed.

No, to be exact, his firstborn, Mills Voisa, was needed.

“Kuku. Simon, Kallum. They must be laughing at me right now, no? Alright, laugh and curse to your heart’s content. Since there isn’t even much time left to do so.”

Only Mills, who was out in the Estia Empire, needed to come back.

“The moment Mills return together with the Imperial Army, the Rinse Kingdom will become mine. Kukuku.”

Together with a crazed laughter, Tommy shone horrifying light from his eyes.

He once again emptied his wine cup, then stood up from his seat.

The wide plain that spread outside the castle wall was seen.

“Uaaak!”

“Kuuk!”

“Die!”

The sight of his soldiers one-sidedly falling down.

Tommy looked at Simon’s forces that approached as if to immediately capture the Stellon Castle and threw his cup.

“Hii.”

Few nobles shrank back with completely scared expressions.

Tommy for a moment looked back with disinterested eyes at the nobles, then curtly spoke.

“Let’s go. We will abandon Stellon Castle.”

A truly simple and light decision.

The Stellon Castle, the strategic points amongst strategic point, the fortress amongst fortresses, wasn’t a place that should be easily abandoned like so or easily conquered.

But with the slightly unfavorable war situation as an excuse, Tommy made an idiotic decision.

The nobles, without the heart to dare remonstrate, only lowered their heads.

Even to them, there was only one life and was greatly precious.

“Yes, your highness. We will follow as you command.”

An absurd situation.

A situation of the entire command group retreating in a situation where thousands of soldiers were fighting with their lives had arose.

The news inside the castle soon was passed to the outside.

“We’re already retreating?”

“Then what about us?!”

“Damn it!”

Tommy’s soldiers, who were fighting against Simon’s forces, panicked with half dazed expressions.

Simon immediately noticed Tommy’s forces’ change.

“So the idiotic little brother has ordered an even more idiotic command.”

Simon, who was watching the situation, bloodily smiled and pulled out his sword.

Viscount Tio Ruin and so on, who were at the side, took up their own weapons with tense expressions.

Simon glared at the Stellon Castle of firm walls and kicked his horse.

“We are conquering the castle in a single breath!”

A sonorous voice.

Tio and numerous warriors followed his back.

“Attack!”

“Attack! Capture the castle!”

A force of thousands, tens of thousands charged towards the Stellon Castle at once.

The Stellon Castle, where the command group had already left, was no different than a candle before a wind.

“Su, surrender! We surrender!”

“We were wrong, sir!”

“We’ll throw our weapons away, sir!”

Tommy’s soldiers quickly threw down their weapons and lay down on the ground.

A situation where the entire command group including Tommy had already left.

In the middle of this, there was nothing they, common soldiers, could do.

Boom!

Together with an deafening boom, even the tightly closed castle gate widely opened.

The defending soldiers who were left inside all ran up and lay down on the ground.

“Waaaah!”

“The enemy has surrendered!”

“It’s our victory!”

Simon’s soldiers shouted cheers and reveled in the joy of victory.

Simon and the numerous nobles stared at the Stellon Castle in front of the drawbridge.

Smiles floated up on their faces.

“I didn’t know that we will capture the Stellon Castle that is famed to be impregnable so easily like this, sirs.”

“This is all thanks to your highness the prince’s outstanding abilities.”

“You are truly amazing, your highness.”

The nobles’ flattery and sycophancy poured down.

Tio looked at the thousands of soldiers who were lying down on the ground and made delighted expression.

“We will reform the surrendered to each troop, your highness.”

A situation where a single soldier was regrettable.

Thousands of surrendered soldiers were a great military strength.

At that moment, Simon, who had been quietly watching the situation, gave an order with calm voice.

“We will kill every surrendered soldier.”

Because it was such as calm order, even Tio unknowingly nodded his head.

“Yes, your highness. Under…… eh?! Wha, what did you just say, your highness?”

But he soon grasp the order’s meaning and formed startled expression.

That was also the same for the other nobles.

“P, prince. Even the surrendered are our kingdom’s people.”

“Those guys are also the same Rinse people, your highness.”

Flustered voices.

But Simon, as if to say what did that matter, widely opened his eyes.

“Are you telling me to forgive the bastards who pointed their swords at me for merely such reason?”

“Tha, that is……”

The nobles, with panicked expressions, quibbled their words.

Simon soon burst out a laughter.

“Furthermore, there are still many who follow Tommy and Kallum within the kingdom. I plan to clearly show them. Of what happens if they raise their swords at me……”

A killing intent reflected on his eyes.

‘The evil mana again……”

Tio clenched his teeth.

He stepped up to raise a protest to Simon.

But.

‘Even though it is a truly vicious and cruel order, prince’s word is not wrong……’

What if they could sacrifice the surrendered soldiers in front of their eyes and save many more people’s lives?

Gulp.

Tio dryly swallowed.

His gaze went towards Simon.

Simon was already looking at Tio.

A light in his eyes that said “you understand me, right?”.

“Huu.”

Tio spat out a long sigh and stepped back.

The faces of nobles, who were at least putting their hopes on Tio, turned pitch dark.

On the other hand, an odd smile floated up on Simon’s face.

He looked at the surrendered soldiers prostrating on the ground and once again gave the order.

“Kill them all without leaving a single one left.”

A cold voice.

The answer did not easily come out.

However, they couldn’t disobey the order either.

“Yes. Understood.”

Finally, numerous nobles lowered their heads.

Simultaneously, numerous commanders led the troops and moved.

“Eh? Eh?”

“Wha, what are you doing?”

“We, we are also Rinse people, you know?”

“I came out to the battlefield for the first time yesterday.”

“I only came because they said they’ll give flour. Really.”

“Let me live. Let me live!”

The surrendered soldiers falteringly stepped back and shouted.

“So you should’ve chosen your master wisely.”

“It’s all you bastards’ fault.”

The hearts of Simon’s soldiers who had to execute the order were also uneasy.

They shifted the blame of the current situation onto the surrendered.

Since they could only lessen the guilt even a little bit by doing so.

“We are also Rinse people!”

“You sons of bitches!”

“Uaak!”

“Kuuk!”

Curses and screams.

Wailing cries filled the battlefield.

Simon and the nobles watched that sight for a moment, then soon turned their horses and disappeared.

They moved to find the next prey.

Screams, without ending, kept continuing on at the Stellon Castle.

Simon’s vicious and cruel order seemed to radiate with light.

Because few commanders and nobles who followed Tommy and Kallum became afraid in advance and surrendered one after another.

“Hahaha! All of you look! Were my words not correct? Yes? Hahaha!”

Simon bursted out a crazed laughter.

Numerous nobles effortfully smiled and nodded their heads.

However, a corner in their hearts still felt heavy like lead.

“Hahahaha!”

Simon’s laughter pierced the sky and spread out in every direction.

It was a crazed laughter of a true sense.

But he did not quite know.

That a black flower sculpted by his wretched order was growing in the shade.

The black flower soundlessly and dolefully cried.

The people who inscribed a black flower symbol on their chests.

They all gathered their mouths as one and whispered.

“We are no longer Rinse Kingdom’s citizens.”

Sudden Change (3) End.

Chapter 198




Simon Rinse, Tommy Rinse, Kallum Rinse.

The Rinse Kingdom’s three princes raised a war over the throne.

At the time when King Deni Von Rinse left the world, Simon, who was staying at the capital, Miller, at the time, entered the palace foremost, recovered the king’s corpse, and calmed the palace.

He, while getting into funeral preparation, promptly sent letters to Tommy and Kallum, who were staying in the kingdom’s south, to immediately enter the palace.

But Tommy and Kallum, who realized that Deni III had died without choosing the next generation’s crown, did not follow Simon’s order and instead raised armies.

To this, Simon too instantly reacted.

He raised a large scale force together with the nobles who supported him and then attacked Tommy and Kallum.

At this time, he also sent a conscription order to Roan, the allied leader of the northeastern region and who had the strongest military force in the Rinse Kingdom, but Roan refused.

No, he could only refuse.

Because the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom had timely came and invaded.

Roan, cooperating with the Eastern Regional Corps Supreme Commander Viscount Aaron Tate, organized a defending army. (t/n note: Aaron Tate was a Baron back in ch. 153 Poskein Subjugation (1) which is the last time he appeared according to my memory, but the author seems to have changed his status in this chapter.)

A situation where other nobles were absentminded by the throne succession war and weren’t even lending their fief regiments.

Roan was essentially facing two kingdoms by himself.

From a glance, it was a greatly disadvantageous situation.

But in reality, the war situation flowed favorably, and one-sidedly at that towards Roan.

Although there were various reasons, the biggest were four.

First was that the defense of the Lancephil Fief, which touched borders with the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom, was well-made to a perfect degree.

Following the kingdom’s border, gateways and forts were located without a single gap for even water to flow. (t/n: “without a single gap for even water to flow” is a Korean phrase for really tight. Use “without a single leaking gap” instead?)

The second was Lancephil Fief Regiment’s mighty military strength.

The Lancephil Fief Regiment boasted a military strength mighty enough to be unable to be seen as a mere fief regiment. The actions of Taemusas, which anyone could apply for so long as their abilities were met unlike knights that emphasized bloodline and house, were in fact incredible.

Although the Lancephil Mana Technique, the further developed and tinkered Tale Mana Technique that was born through three kingdom’s basic mana techniques, wasn’t a very powerful mana technique, it was a truly effective mana technique that even ordinary soldiers could show great effects if they persistently trained.

The Byron Kingdom Army and the Istel Kingdom Army, which were relying on few knights, were being helplessly defeated by the Lancephil Fief Regiment’s Taemusas.

The third was the existence of Poskein Navy.

The Poskein Navy, which had seized the Poskein Lake’s North, West, and East, boasted a mighty military force with the military port of Exos Island as its base.

No, rather than a mighty military force, it was almost the sole navy force amongst the numerous kingdoms.

The Poskein Navy, when the Istel Kingdom invaded through land route, separately crossed the Poskein Lake’s North and directly hit the Istel Kingdom’s rear western region.

Thanks to that, the Istel Kingdom Army had an obstruction formed in their ration supplying and couldn’t exhibit proper strength.

Byron Kingdom Army too, as the Istel Kingdom Army that they invaded together with kept collapsing and getting held back, experienced various bottleneck problems in their advance.

And the biggest reason that the two kingdoms couldn’t maintain a sound strength.

The Pershion Kingdom, which touched borders with the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom, had suddenly raised an army.

The Pershion Kingdom, the instant the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom attacked the Lancephil Fief, immediately attacked the two kingdoms’ borders.

The Pershion Kingdom’s Prince Manus Pershion had personally raised an army to help Roan.

Thanks to that, the Byron Kingdom and the Istel Kingdom couldn’t focus their entire strength on only Roan due to minding their frontlines with the Pershion Kingdom.

With these various reasons, Roan had not only perfectly blocked the two kingdoms but also was going out on a fierce counterattack.

But because the three princes were able to focus on the throne succession war thanks to Roan’s such grand performance, it could be said to be a truly paradoxical situation.

“Phlam Region Victory Report, my lord!”

“Traltier Fort Victory Report, sir!”

“Pinto Gateway Victory Report, sir!”

Messengers raced up from every direction.

Undisguisable pride floated up on the faces of retainers who fully filled the conference hall.

The things that were arriving one after another were all news of victory.

Everyone’s gazes turned towards Roan.

Currently, he had completely destroyed the Istel Kingdom Army’s main army and had returned to the Mediasis Castle.

“If it’s like this, the two kingdoms won’t be able to hold any further and retreat, my lord.”

“We should now slowly think of what to receive as war reparation, sirs.”

“Hahaha. I knew that we were strong, but I didn’t know that we were possibly this strong, my lord.”

Voices overflowing with confidence.

But in actuality, Roan had no particular words.

There was a separate messenger he was waiting for.

After who knew how long.

“The agents have arrived, my lord.”

The door abruptly opened and Chris appeared.

Roan deeply breathed in as he nodded his head.

Soon, more than twenty agents of Agens appeared.

They lined up on one side of the grand conference room and saluted.

Roan looked at the agent who stood leftmost amongst them and nodded his head.

“Should we hear it?”

A lightly asking sound.

The agent lightly bowed his head then took out a small piece of paper from his clothes.

“I have monitored the Arrten Region of the kingdom’s West, my lord.”

The Arrten Region was one of the places the three princes’ throne succession war was unfolding.

The report that followed afterwards was truly horrendous.

“Ebbing and flowing battles are unfolding and the losses of the kingdom’s citizens are becoming severe, sir. Furthermore, in the case of Prince Simon, he is either killing or turning surrendered soldiers into captives.”

Many retainers formed shocked expressions.

“The surrenders soldiers?”

“Even though they are all citizens of the same kingdom as us?”

Sounds of shaking heads.

The agent bitterly smiled and continued his report.

“The bigger problem is Prince Tommy’s side, sirs. At that place……”

He couldn’t easily continue the words and hesitated.

“He laughs at people’s lives. Not only thoughtlessly killing his soldiers and retainers, he is even killing the ordinary citizens of the kingdom.”

“What?!”

“No, how could such a thing……”

“Ridiculous.”

The retainers angrily opened their eyes and shouted.

Roan was also the same.

With his brows creased, he bit his lower lips.

The agent’s story continued.

“Prince Simon had once executed all surrendered soldiers. Afterwards, few troops of Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum became scared and surrendered to Prince Simon.”

“Hmm.”

Roan leaked a short groan.

The situation of how it happened roughly became drawn inside his head.

“It must have been on the pretext of executing the traitors.”

At Roan’s words, the agents nodded their heads.

“Yes. That is correct. Prince Tommy has recaptured the troops and regions that had betrayed him and has committed a revenge of blood.”

It was an absurd event.

Even though it was the middle of the throne succession war, everyone was the same Rinse Kingdom’s citizens.

No, even when in a war with an enemy kingdom, no one carelessly touched the ordinary citizens of the kingdoms.

Because controlling the captured land became difficult later on in the case ordinary citizens’ resentments poured down.

Furthermore, there was no particular need to create infamy.

Unless one planned to become a despot.

“He’s crazy.”

“Even if he climbs to the throne after doing such rabid acts, just how would the kingdom run properly.”

The retainers shook their heads with expressions full of rage.

The agent’s report continued on.

“Prince Kallum is showing the most faultless actions, but……”

As expected, the aftertaste wasn’t good.

The agent exhaled a short sigh.

“Prince Kallum seems to be trying to pull in a foreign power, my lord.”

“By foreign power, Aimas Union?”

In the first place, Kallum had a rather deep relationship with Aimas Union.

It was because his maternal grandfather Liss Kowan had a friendship with Aimas for a long time.

But Aimas Union was, with the Poskein Lake in between, far away from the Rinse Kingdom.

Them sending an army to the Rinse Kingdom shouldn’t be an easy task.

At that moment, the agent shook his head.

“No my lord. It seems he had joined hands with the north’s Diez Kingdom. And……”

A truly troubled expression.

He hesitated for a moment, than cautiously continued his words.

“There are rumors that he joined hands even with the Istel Kingdom.”

“Istel Kingdom?”

The retainers soon creased their brows and asked back.

The Istel Kingdom was an invading kingdom.

To join hands with the enemy kingdom, it simply wasn’t something that one would do with a sane mind.

“It’s a field of dogs.” (t/n note: Korean phrase meaning “mess/chaos”, but I translated it directly to maintain the vulgar tone.)

Ultimately, someone couldn’t hold back and burst out in rage.

It wasn’t a speech that a mere noble house’s retainer could dare to say of princes.

However, there was no one who berated him.

With current situation, the Rinse Kingdom would fall into hell regardless of whoever became the king amongst the three princes.

The reports of the agents that followed too were gruesome and horrendous.

“I have monitored the Hoel Region of the East, my lord.”

“I have monitored Miste Region of the South.”

“I have monitored Southeast’s……”

“I……”

The reports of the regions where the throne succession war was unfolding kept continuing.

Like the first report, the other regions too were suffering from the princes’ wrongdoings and idiotic orders.

Execution of surrendered, destruction of villages, enslavement of the kingdom’s citizens……

Everything was of worst.

In no time, it became the final agent’s turn.

“I have monitored the capital, Miller.”

The center of the Rinse Kingdom and where the apex of the political power was located.

“There was no noteworthy state of crisis in the capital, Miller, because it was under Prince Simon’s control. But……”

As expected it wasn’t a good report.

“Prince Simon raided the noble houses that support Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum and has executed all of their families and relatives. On top of this, he immediately hunted down and arrested even in the case of citizens who show actions that may perhaps support other princes and is sending them to the Grain Mountains’ mines.”

“It’s a hell there too.”

The retainers formed bitter smiles.

“And this is a rumor circulating amongst few nobles, but……”

The agent too formed a bitter smile.

“They say that Prince Simon is preparing a coronation ceremony.”

The retainers once again asked back with shocked expressions.

“Coronation ceremony? On what grounds?”

“Even though the throne succession war is still going on?”

“Would other princes and their supporting factions stay still?”

At those words, the agent answered in a calm voice.

“It seems to be a judgment that there is no big issue since he already rules over more than half of the kingdom’s land, sirs. Anyhow, that is a rumor that is going around amongst few nobles. And……”

His gaze headed towards Roan.

The agent, deeply breathing in, formed a peculiar smile.

“There is an odd rumor that is going around amongst the Miller Castle’s residents, and especially between ordinary commoners.”

“An odd rumor?”

Roan showed a reaction.

The smile hanging on the agent’s mouth became much thicker.

“It’s a rumor that says, since the kingdom and the citizens have fallen into distress and screams don’t end anywhere due to the three princes’ throne succession war, a hero who would break up and save this situation must appear.”

“Hmm.”

Roan leaked a quiet groan.

The agent’s story continued.

“And every person, as that hero,……”

He left the end of his words hanging.

Naturally, everyone’s gazes headed towards Roan.

The agent cheerfully smiled and finished his words.

“Is choosing my lord.”

The retainers smiled along and nodded their heads.

Even for them to think of, that rumor was not so wrong.

The sole person who was shining even in such a difficult situation.

That person was in fact Roan.

But in actuality, Roan had no particular change in expression.

He complimented the agents who had worked hard, then called away all the retainers and only left Chris at his side.

“A hell opened up over the entire kingdom.”

His heart felt bitter.

Chris, together with a short sigh, nodded his head.

“I can more than understand their feelings of wanting a hero, my lord.”

He looked straight at Roan’s two eyes.

“To the three princes, the kingdom’s citizens are currently existences same as mote. They have no thoughts of looking after and embracing them. Rather, they treat them as burdensome existences.”

Existences who were only being hindrances to going all the way to the apex of political power, the throne of the king.

The three princes considered them to be just that much.

Roan deeply breathed in.

“Your thoughts?”

A shortly asking sound.

Chris unhesitantly answered.

“You save them, my lord. They require of my lord.”

A voice bold and full of certainty.

Roan quietly stared straight at Chris’s eyes.

A silence flowed.

Although there were no words, many stories were held within the two people’s gazes.

Finally, Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Chris.”

“Yes. My lord.”

Chris stood up from his seat and lowered his head.

Roan too leaned on the table with his hand and stood up from his seat.

“Bring Clay.”

“Are you finally calling him, sir?”

Chris delighted and asked.

Roan slowly nodded his head.

“Yes. I now plan to personally set the board and draw the picture.”

The big picture called salvation of the kingdom and its citizens.

Clay would become the paint that would draw that picture.

His heart quickly raced.

At the same time, the tips of his mouth gently went up.

“Let us go flip the world.”

Sudden Change (4) End.

Chapter 199




T/n: Sorry, only two chapters today. I had a rather important paper due tonight, and that took up my time. Also, Sai101 was busy today so Fujimaru helped out with proofreading. Next update will probably be Sunday this week with more chapters.

“Have you heard the rumor?”

“What rumor?”

“What do you mean what rumor. The rumor about Sir Count Lancephil.”

“Ah…… I heard it, I heard it of course.”

Few soldiers gathered and chatted in quiet voices.

On their chests, a blue longsword symbolizing the Second Prince Tommy Rinse was etched.

The soldier who first spoke up, with a slightly nervous look, added on.

“Sir Count Lancephil repelled the Byron Kingdom Army and the Istel Kingdom Army and……”

When his words reached about that point.

“Nah, it isn’t that Sir Count Lancephil repelled them. From what I heard, the Pershion Kingdom invaded the two kingdoms……”

Thin-eyed soldier cut in with a sharp voice.

Instantly, numerous soldiers squinted their eyes.

“The two kingdoms weren’t even a match for Sir Count Lancephil even before the Pershion Kingdom attacked, you know?”

“Right. They probably haven’t even won once, no?”

“It was Sir Count Lancephil’s complete victory.”

The voices turned higher.

Although all the soldiers were following Tommy, they too were Rinse Kingdom’s citizens.

Roan, who achieved complete victories against the two kingdoms, Byron and Istel, whenever the kingdom was in difficulty, was their pride and treasure.

“I, I got it. I just meant that the rumors are like that.”

The thin-eyed soldier shrunk back his head and formed an awkward smile.

The soldier who spoke up first glared his eyes once, then continued his words.

“Anyway, it looks like Sir Count Lancephil is going to enter the throne succession war full on after defeating the two kingdom’s armies. I heard the rumors that he already has completely subdued the surrounding regions around Lancephil County.”

Another soldier nodded his head and echoed.

“And those subduing weren’t simple subjugation either. They say that the number of places he subdued with force is a small minority. It seems that the countryside nobles who followed Prince Tommy and Prince Kallum raced to surrender the moment the news Sir Count Lancephil has entered the war was passed. He has subdued the kingdom’s northern region without even fighting.”

“Thanks to that, they say the supporting factions in the North that were barely continuing their existences all got wiped out.”

“Now the north of the capital, Miller, has truly became Prince Simon’s territory.”

One soldier bitterly smiled and sighed.

At that moment, the thin-eyed soldier who got a round of curses once again spoke in a gruff voice.

“Tch. We don’t know that. Whether it’s Prince Simon’s territory or Sir Count Lancephil’s territory……”

“What?”

The other soldiers creased their foreheads once more and glared at the thin-eyed soldier.

“Wha, what…… no I’m just……”

When he awkwardly smiled and tried to lay out excuses.

“No. Those words do have a point.”

The soldier who spoke up the story about Roan shrugged his shoulders.

Soon following, other soldiers echoed.

“Right. And since the topic came up, isn’t Sir Count Lancephil much better than Prince Simon from our position?”

“Right. They do say that Prince Simon executed all surrendered soldiers before……”

“If Prince Simon climbs to the throne like this……”

The soldiers wordlessly unfolded their world of imagination in their heads.

“Uuuuh.”

River of blood, mountain of corpses.

A horrible end as plain as day.

Goosebumps peaked all over their bodies.

And what was even worse was..

‘That it doesn’t feel like it’ll get quite better even if we serve Prince Tommy like this.’

That was also the same in Kallum’s case.

Regardless of whoever amongst the three princes became the king, the Rinse Kingdom would meet an era of schism and strife.

A sigh flowed out.

It wasn’t just one or two people.

“Huu…… just how did the kingdom become like this……”

All the soldiers dropped their heads and spat out long sighs.

“Anyhow, since Sir Count Lancephil has completely subdued the kingdom’s northern region, he should soon come to Eastbury Region here.”

The place closest to the North with the capital, Miller, as the center was the very Eastbury Region here.

Because it was also a strategic point of its own, it was also a place that Simon sent the Relt Legion, Tommy the Uppe Legion, and were intensely waging a battle.

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers nodded with dark light on their faces.

The time to face the Crimson Ghost and the Crimson Legion had drawn right in front of their noses.

Suddenly.

“There’s no need to have such worries already.”

Together with a crude voice, an explosive and muscular man appeared.

“Ah, squad commander.”

“Please sit here, sir.”

The soldiers stood up and lowered their heads as they moved to the sides.

The muscular man called the squad commander took place between the soldiers and burst out a bizarre laughter.

“Kukuk. It’ll take at least ten days if he were to lead a large-scale legion and climb south to here from the kingdom’s North. There’s no need to worry already.”

It was the truth.

Although he would arrive in only two to three days or so if he only led the cavalry and climbed south, he couldn’t do something so reckless with a great war before him.

If he were to set a complete legion including infantry and supply troops and climb south, it took at least six days regardless of however fast he was.

Even then, it was about that much when he would do an incredibly strained march.

The squad commander eccentrically smiled and clapped his hands.

“So all of you rest well and save up on your strength instead. Because a big battle will happen ten days from now.”

At those words, one of the soldiers cautiously asked.

“The opponent is the Crimson Legion said to be the kingdom’s strongest. Could we be a match to them?”

“He’s right.”

“Our Uppe Legion is made up of fief regiments……”

It was a united legion made up of numerous nobles’ fief regiments.

The squad commander, at the soldiers’ moaning sounds, snickered out a laugh and pointed towards the outside of the camp.

“We began camp maintenance work starting today. And we decided to make pitfalls on the outside of the camp. If we were to do wage a grand battle, a frontal fight with strength against strength, the possibility of us losing will be high. But if we face them after placing pitfalls beforehand and thicken our camp’s defense, even the Lancephil Fief Regiment won’t be able to do anything.”

“Ah! So we’re doing a type of a castle defense battle?”

“Right. That’s exactly it. We’ll just plant ourselves tight in our camp and hold onto their ankles.”

The squad commander loudly laughed and nodded his head.

A castle defense battle waged in a field battle.

It was the strategy decided through the commanders’ meeting.

The Uppe Legion’s commanders didn’t show useless pride or ambition.

They had meekly recognized Roan and the Lancephil Fief Regiment’s might and had decided to stick themselves inside the camp and fight.

“So don’t worry too much.”

The squad commander, standing up from his seat, looked towards the north.

Confidence overflowed on his face.

“Because even the Lancephil Fief Regiment, that Crimson Legion won’t be able to conquer our camp.”

At those words, many soldiers clenched their teeth and nodded their heads.

Confidences filled up from places deep within their hearts.

‘Right. If we prepare and get ready from far beforehand, even the Crimson Legion won’t be able to do anything.’

‘They’re fighting on top of our palms. There’s nothing to be afraid of.’

‘Since we’ll place pitfalls and even thicken our camp’s defenses further.’

Their eyes flashed and shone with light.

However, such confidences of Uppe Legion’s soldiers were crumbled to dust in merely two days.

“Wha, what’s that?”

“Tha, that’s……”

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers stood on the camp’s watchtowers and stared towards the north.

All of their expressions were half-dazed.

Especially the soldiers who were setting up the traps outside the camp, seeing the white fume that fully filled the northern sky, froze like stone statues.

“I, isn’t that the Lancephil Fief Regiment?”

One amongst the soldiers pointed at the a highly soaring flag.

A flag that, together with a flower petal, two sets of spears and a shield were drawn.

It was definitely the old Baron Tale House’s crest and the current Count Lancephil House’s crest.

Dudududududu!

Soon, the sound of horse hooves shaking the ground hit their ears.

The dust cloud scattered and hundreds, thousands of cavalries showed up behind the highly soaring flag.

“Eh, eh, eh, eh!”

“Ho, how is the Lancephil Fief Regiment already?!”

Eyes widely opening as if they couldn’t believe.

Suddenly.

Drrrrr!

Together with a monstrous sound and parting the dust clouds, no, raising the dust clouds, more than tens of giant-sized carriages appeared.

“Wha, what is that now?”

“There’s a carriage as big as that?”

“Rather than that, look at the horses pulling the carriages!”

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers, with their mouths wide open, scowl at the carriages.

Shockingly, only two ordinary horses were all that were pulling the giant carriages.

Clank! Clank!

The metal armor the warhorses wore clashed against each other and produced metallic sounds.

“S, shouldn’t we be running away?”

“Uuuh. To think it’s the Crimson Ghost and the Crimson Legion!”

Few soldiers threw down their spades and pickaxes and falteringly moved back.

At that moment, the commander rank soldiers pulled out the swords at their waists and shouted.

“Do not retreat! Look closely at the Lancephil Fief Regiment! They have only brought cavalry and have urgently rushed south! They don’t have any infantry at all!”

At those words, the soldiers stood their places and thinly opened their eyes.

It was the truth.

The Lancephil Fief Regiment was made up of only cavalry and giant carriages of unknown identity.

‘Right. He did say that it’ll take at least ten days to get to this region.’

‘The fact that even the cavalry arrived in just two days means that they are as tired as they could be!’

‘They too aren’t of perfect condition!’

However strong the Lancephil Fief Regiment was said to be, there was something called affinity between troops.

Although cavalry had good mobility and destructiveness, the attack patterns were much too limited.

There were no distinct tactics besides piercing through or charging, and if they were accidentally trapped in a pitfall region, a problem where their room for movement narrowing broke out.

Furthermore, it couldn’t use any strength at all when alone in a fight with halberd infantry or archer class of soldiers.

“Aren’t they looking down at us too much?”

“If they’re all cavalry, we can simply send out long spear troops and take down their mobility.”

Uppe Legion’s soldiers sneered and shone a viper-like light from their eyes.

Perhaps having heard the soldiers’ such story, the Lancephil Fief Regiment’s cavalry and carriages slowly reduced their speeds, then soon completely came to a stop.

Neeigh!

Rough cries of the horses hit the ears.

Gulp.

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers, unknowingly with dazed expressions, watched that grand and incredible sight.

Simultaneously, the Uppe Legion’s main army charged from the camp’s rear to intercept.

Literally an explosive situation.

“Alright. Let’s try it.”

“We’ll show you that it’s not even enough with merely the cavalry.”

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers pulled out their own weapons and gritted their teeth.

When they got the thoughts that they were looked down on and that it was doable, the morale that had hit the ground slowly climbed up.

“Everyone grab your weapons.”

“Let’s fight do or die.”

Sounds of resolving hearts poured out.

At that moment.

Boom!

Together with an explosive sound, the giant carriage’s left and right sides fully opened up.

No, as if they were ripped away, the top section split and fully unfolded towards each side’s ground.

An event that simultaneously happened from tens of carriages.

It was a shape that seemed like they made a slope from the ground to the carriage’s inside with strong planks.

“Wha, what the?”

“Did the carriages break apart?”

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers blankly stood and merely blinked their eyes.

At that moment, soldiers stepped on the carriages’ walls that opened up to the sides and poured out.

They were crimson ghosts that all equipped from head to toe with red like one.

They, without a single tired look, came out of the carriages and set formation.

It was a moment that a lame legion with only cavalry was reborn into a powerful legion that had set all types of troops.

“Huhgh.”

At the thick presence and pressure, the Uppe Legion’s soldiers emptily swallowed.

In front of their eyes were all colored with a red light.

Meanwhile, the crimson soldiers perfectly formed an oblong formation and then pulled out their weapons.

A feeling like a riptide-like charge would begin at any moment.

“Uuuuh.”

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers trembled with completely unstrung expressions.

A situation where their minds were petrified by fear.

Suddenly, the crimson soldiers in the middle moved back to the sides.

Simultaneously, a young man riding a slick and muscular warhorse appeared.

A crimson helmet, a crimson armor, a crimson cloak.

Deep eyes on a manly looking face.

He was the very owner of the Crimson Legion and the Rinse Kingdom’s hero, Roan Lancephil the Crimson Ghost.

‘The magic carriages are usefully being applied.’

Roan, after quelling the Rinse Kingdom’s northern regions, began to climb south with the Lancephil Fief Regiment.

Literally a blitzkrieg, a situation where a single second was urgent.

But even so, it wasn’t a situation where he could do a straining march just because numerous situations were urgent either.

If not careful, they could also have taken the enemy force’s attack the moment they arrive at the battlefield and receive a great damage.

At that moment, the thing that floated up in his head were the very magic carriages, the center of the Lancephil County’s transportation network.

On top of the twenty or so magic carriages that were already in use, Roan pulled out all the magic carriages he had saved for military purpose and boarded the infantry.

Not only that, the ration and goods supplying that was indispensably needed in battles and wars too were proceeded together through the magic carriages.

Thanks to that, Roan was able to make a speed similar to a cavalry troop marching alone even while climbing south together with a large-scale legion.

That was the very reason that Roan and the Crimson Legion were able to quickly arrive at the Eastbury Region unlike the predictions of Uppe Legion’s soldiers.

Roan quietly stared at the Uppe Legion’s stiffly frozen soldiers.

A soft light in his eyes and faintly floated smile.

It was a look that truly calmed people.

However, the might and presence that burst out from his entire body naturally made people lower their heads.

“I am Rinse Kingdom’s Count and the owner of the Lancephil Fief of Northeast, Roan Lancephil.”

A powerful voice rode the wind and stir the battlefield.

Gulp.

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers all dryly gulped with tense expressions.

Roan quietly looked at them and added on.

“Those who surrender, I will respectfully receive as my soldiers. But those who oppose……”

A resolute tone and expression.

There was not a single hint of trembling in his eyes.

“I will not forgive.”

The instant his words finished.

Chang! Klang klang! Chachang!

The Uppe Legion’s soldiers threw down the weapons they held.

They quickly kneeled and lied down on the ground.

“We surrender!”

“W, we have no desire to fight Sir Count Lancephil!”

In the first place, the Uppe Legion’s soldiers had absolutely no thought of fighting outside the camp even if they set the traps and thicken the camp’s defense.

In such situation, being carried away by ill-advised bravery was no different than extending out their necks longly and begging to quickly cut them down.

Roan stared at the soldiers who prostrated on the ground and climbed down from his warhorse.

He moved his steps alone towards the soldiers.

The commanders including Austin and the Taemusas tried to follow up, but Roan faintly smiled and waved his hand.

Roan gently held the shoulders of the Uppe Legion’s soldier that was furthest at the front.

“Stand up.”

He raised up the soldier.

At those words, even the other soldiers stood up one by one from their spots.

Roan looked straight into their eyes and spoke in a bold and daring voice.
