The Dark Court


Screams echoed as the Dark Queen walked the Halls of Pain. Even after epochs, the sounds of suffering could still ease her mind. This section of the hall was reserved for her most skilled torturers and had been crafted by her best engineers. The torture chambers were shaped to magnify and channel the cries of pain. The immortal souls locked in perpetual agony had been worked on so long that their cries were as predictable as the notes of a perfectly tuned instrument. The torturers were artists who created a symphony just for her. This day, she barely noticed the thousands-strong orchestra. Other thoughts occupied her mind.

The plague squad had yet to find whomever had caused such a stir in the River Peninsula. It was such an inconsequential region of The Land, weak and petty kingdoms that bordered areas of old magic and powerful monsters. It was only these natural defenses that had allowed the kingdoms there to survive. Because of this, the agents she had available were limited.

And yet, her truth seekers and soothsayers all spoke of a rising power in the peninsula. They disagreed about everything, but they seemed fairly clear that the power was not from one of the kingdoms. Some said it was on the Plains of Gold, others were sure it was in the mountains, but most swore the power was localized to the Forest of Nadria.

This all would be fine. She could simply move agents from other parts of The Land, but now spikes of change and power had been detected in every corner of the world. Continent-spanning empires were being thrown into upheaval. Nearly forgotten Powers were stirring once again, and the Light Court was as curious as she. The only useful intelligence she had came from her Vizier.

The strange being said that he had detected new Powers walking The Land. He had spoken of men and monsters that seemed to possess a seed of chaos in their souls. The Vizier had identified more than one thousand and stated they were appearing with greater frequency. None had met yet, but he said they seemed to be attracted to one another. A few, the ones at the center of the greatest disruptions in The Land, actually seemed to be pulling others to them. The Vizier said that, from what he could see, the beings were completely unaware of this.

The only exception was, maddeningly again, in the River Peninsula. These “chaos seeds” were being drawn towards the Forest of Nadria, despite the fact that no chaos seed had been detected there. The Queen had asked the Vizier if he could have missed something. As always when she spoke, her voice was sharp and delicate, like a blade of honed obsidian that could pierce the heart before one felt pain. That voice normally struck fear in the hearts of all who heard it, but the Vizier had just replied in the same quiet voice he always used.

“It is possible. As you well know, my Queen, our powers are severely curtailed since The Exile.”

He had simply stood there after admitting his possible fault. Ultimately, she had dismissed him. If any others had failed her, she would have destroyed them utterly, but the Vizier was one of the few members of her Court that she found useful. It was that thought that had reminded her of something and had brought her to the Halls of Pain. There was, thankfully, one thing she could always count on: the stupidity of others.

It was rare for her torturers to get seven new subjects in a day. Even more rare that all were Exiles. When she had discovered that the incompetent cabal had sent a Plague Squad into the peninsula without her consent, the Queen had almost been grateful. Such a transgression could not be allowed to pass, however. A part of her considered forbidding breeding among her court again. The offspring of the Originals were always plotting and scheming; her own son was no different.

A scream of pleading agony reached her ear, and she allowed herself a faint smile. On the other hand, without the Exiles she would not now have seven new instruments to add to her symphony.





The Light Court




Screams echoed through the throne room of the Light Court. Celestial blood fell to the gleaming white floor as the former High Chancellor was tortured. Every member of the Court was present, by the King’s decree. He wanted them all to see the consequence of failure. The King sat on his throne and watched impassively as the torturer plied his trade.

Some members of the Court looked away, appalled at this reminder that they were not truly immortal. Very few things could destroy an Original or Exile, but they existed. Others grinned in savage glee at seeing a high-ranking member of the court brought so low. The King made mental notes of each. Nothing escaped his cold, dead eyes.

The chancellor had failed to find answers quickly enough for the monarch. Once again, he had come before the Court with only suppositions and theories. Without any expression, the King had struck the being down with his magic. A moment later, a portal to an abyssal realm had opened, and a demon lord had stepped through. The powerful being had bowed to the Light King and asked, in a voice like the scream of a burning soul, how he could be of service. Seconds later, the demon lord’s claws were digging into the cosmic matter of the chancellor’s body and swallowing it whole while the Court watched.

One idea that the chancellor proposed before all the screaming began was that a squad of vindicators be dispatched. While the King listened to hours of screaming agony, he pondered the idea, and a faint smile came to his face. Other sources of intelligence had brought it to his attention that a Plague Squad had been dispatched to the River Peninsula by the Dark Court. If nothing else, having one of the Light Court’s elite squads battle their Dark Court counterparts should be interesting.





CHAPTER 1 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




Richter looked up at the opening in the earth sixty feet above him. As his muscles ached, Sion shouted down at him to hold on, and he heard another sprite voice shout in the distance, “Your lord! I must speak to your lord! He has to know!”

The chaos seed hung there, battered and bruised. A stack of prompts flashed in the corner of his vision, waiting to be read, including one that had the clear, pulsing border of an absorbed memory. None of this interested him at the moment, though.

Despite everything that had just happened, despite all of the things that were waiting to be done, and even despite the mystery of what he had ‘to know,’ there was only one thing on Richter’s mind. He sighed heavily in frustration and pain, then shouted up to his people looking down at him, “Would you hurry the fuck up! I’m literally hanging off a cliff down here!

All that kept him from falling to his death was one hand clutching the hilt of his short sword. The weapon was jammed into the wall of the pit he hung over. As he had fallen, Richter had managed to desperately plunge the clear green blade into the stone as he fell. To be honest, he hadn’t actually expected it to work, but luckily the fey metal had been up to the task.

As he swayed slightly in the air, he swung his other hand up with a pained grunt. His muscles felt like they had been stretched and seared, and his free hand was shaking slightly as he came down from the battle high. Despite this, he was able to grab a small shelf of stone. Now somewhat more secure, he breathed out slightly in relief. That feeling didn’t last.

An internal voice told him, no screamed at him, not to, but Richter just couldn’t resist looking down. Both arms extended above his head, he twisted his neck back and to the right. Beneath him, a sea of black satin Dark magic undulated and hinted of hidden monsters.

Gazing at the pool of pitch-black magic beneath him, fear began to worm its way through his heart. That internal voice sat back, smug, and said, ‘See, dumbass? You shouldn’t have looked.’ The voice wasn’t getting any argument from Richter anymore. He kept staring for a few seconds, afraid that a creature of the Dark would rise up and attack him, but thankfully the level of roiling liquid began to drop. Whether it was because the spell duration had elapsed or whether it was because the Witch Doctor had been killed, Richter didn’t know. Even if he did, though, it would be safe to say that he gave absolutely zero fucks. The chaos seed was just happy that he wouldn’t be pulled down into whatever had made that blackness. A few seconds later, it had disappeared, leaving a narrow shaft that led deep into the ground. The bottom was obscured by the natural darkness of shadow.

Richter was about to shout up to his people again when a rope dropped down from above. He ground his teeth together in pure frustration when he saw that the end of the rope was still a few feet short of his position. To make matters worse, the wall he was hanging from was angled. The pit flared out from the hole like a cone with the top cut off. It meant that the rope was not only two feet above his head, but it was five feet behind him. His name wasn’t Pythagoras, and he didn’t know the hypotenuse, but he did know he was fucked! Trying to keep from screaming every curse he knew as he clung to the shaft wall like a fly on glass, he instead shouted up, “It’s not long enough!”

Sion’s head poked out over the hole, “It is all the rope we have. Now grab it!”

“You grab it!” Richter snapped back. He couldn’t help it anymore! “Gahhh!” he shouted in frustration. His body was battered, and he was exhausted. If the shaft rose straight up, he might have tried to scale the rock wall. His enchanted gauntlets gave a boost to climbing, after all. His stamina was already low, however, and the act of supporting his weight while he hung over empty air was making the green bar slowly drop even more. Richter’s jaw was tight with frustration, but he also knew that staring at the rope above his head wasn’t going to bring it any closer. The chaos seed took a deep breath as he steeled himself for what was about to happen.

Keeping a death grip on the hilt of his elementum short sword with his right-hand, he let go of the shelf with his left. For a moment, he once again rotated slowly over the bottomless chasm. The only thing anchoring him to this life was the foot-and-a-half of his green blade that he had managed to jam into a crack in the stone. It did not fill him with a sense of security. He felt even less ‘secure’ when his short sword slid two inches out of the wall.

“Shit! Shit shit shit shit shit shit!” While expletives flew from the chaos seed’s mouth, he yanked his Moonstone Dagger of +3 from his belt. Richter did a one arm pullup, using his already slipping short sword as an anchor, and slammed his white-bladed dagger into the stone above him. It did not enter the rock as easily as the clear green metal of his short sword, but the moonstone weapon was still able to give him another handhold. He had made sure to angle the blade perpendicular to the pull of gravity. With his weight distributed, the short sword stopped sliding. Richter exhaled in relief.

“Be careful,” Sion shouted down. “I think you almost fell.”

Richter’s nostrils started flaring. He breathed out slowly and softly spoke the truth of his heart, “Muthafucka, I’m going to kill you.” Deciding not to waste energy on shouting up his response to his friend’s superfluous advice, he implemented the next phase of his plan. Richter braced one foot on a small knob of stone to try and remove some of the weight he was placing on both blades. Then he began easing his elementum short sword out of the wall. This time, the fact that it slid free easily worked in his favor.

He stretched his body and jabbed the tip of the green blade into the stone above him several times. With each strike against the cliff face, the edge of the blade dulled. The impossibly hard fey metal was tough enough to only lose a few points of durability through the process, but Richter still knew that that Krom would be apoplectic if he saw the powerful instrument of war being utilized in such a fashion. At the moment, Richter didn’t care. The point was that it got the job done. A small hole appeared in the shaft wall.

The chaos seed coughed and shook his head to clear some of the dust and gravel that had fallen down on him, then slid the short sword into the sheath on his back. Richter pulled himself up, using his dagger as a handhold and stuck his fingers into the hole he had made. Slowly wiggling the dagger’s hilt, he eased it out of the wall. His other arm began to tremble, and his stamina bar started falling faster. With a loud cry, he jammed the dagger into a nearby crack several feet higher than its previous home, praying to find purchase. It entered the break in the stone… and it held!

Richter closed his eyes. For the brief moment before the dagger was secure, his heart had started hammering in his chest again. He took several deep breaths to center his mind. When he was able to focus clearly on his purpose, he increased his breathing again to psyche himself up. The chaos seed swung both feet up to the angled wall. Pulling up with both hands, he kicked off of the wall at the same time and turned to face the rope hanging in the air before him!

Richter stretched out, and his hand grabbed for the line that swayed in front of him. He reached like a parched man for rain. In the seconds that his body moved through the air, the rope bobbed away slightly, and his heart seized in his chest. His eyes stayed glued to the plaited cord, refusing to look down again. The chaos seed’s lips curled back in a snarl as a shout built in his chest. As the fingers of his left hand wrapped around the rope, he bellowed, “Yessss!”

The rope slid through his fingers as gravity tried to kill him a final time, but he was able to secure a grip before he slid off of the end. His momentum made the coarse line sway like a pendulum. Once he reached the end of the swing, his body started swinging back towards the wall. Deciding to double down, Richter reached out with one hand and was able to grab the tip of his dagger’s hilt. The rope swung back towards the center of the pit again, and the dagger slid free of the wall!

He was going to live! And he had gotten his shit back! Richter quickly placed his moonstone dagger back into its belt sheath and grabbed the rope with both hands. His legs still hung free, but as he hung there, he threw his head back and laughed maniacally. “All I do is win!” he shouted up as his stamina bar grew close to bottoming out. The damn rope swayed back and forth and he heard a shout from the top of the pit as they started to pull him up. Richter wasn’t about to wait. In a feat of athleticism that he hadn’t even known he was capable of, the chaos seed started pulling himself up the rope using only the strength of his arms. His abused muscles trembled. An electric pain shot from his shoulders and up into his neck. He pushed through it, but his head began to grow foggy as his stamina entered single digits.

Knowing there was not much time left, Richter wrapped one leg around the rope and used his other leg to trap it. He freed one hand and reached into his Bag of Holding. Focusing on what he wanted to retrieve, a potion materialized in his hand. He brought it to his mouth and grabbed the top with his teeth. A slow pull was all it took to free the stopper. He spat it out and poured the green solution into his mouth. He almost cooed as sweet, blessed relief swept through his body. The stamina potion made the green bar on his interface start to rise. He dropped the glass vial into the abyss and tilted his head back as he was pulled back up out of the abyss. A smile of pure lassitude grew on his face, and he spoke quietly to the air around him, “Win, win, win no matter what!”





CHAPTER 2 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





As soon as he was over the lip of the pit, he rolled over three times. Richter didn’t care if it made him look ridiculous, he was absolutely NOT trusting the integrity of the earth right next to the hole. When he was what he considered a minimal safe distance away, he just lay on his back and looked up at the sky. His heart continued to thud in his chest.

Richter closed his eyes and took a deep breath. A moment later, he exhaled while thanking whatever gods might be listening. The chaos seed never thought he would be so thankful for the simple pleasure of gravity being his friend again. A familiar weight settled on his chest as Alma landed to comfort her master.

Only a few moments passed before a voice interrupted his peace and zen. “Are you just going to lay down all day? There is still work to do, you know.”

Richter cracked one eye and stared at Sion, “Do you know that I almost died down there?”

“I could always throw you back down the hole if you left your balls behind,” Sion retorted. “Do you seriously not hear all of that?”

Richter honestly had been blocking everything out, just happy to be alive, but then he heard what his friend was talking about. Muttered curses in goblin-speak, muted moans of pain, and an urgent voice speaking in the sprites’ tongue, “I have to speak with him!”

The irritation left Richter’s face. Sion was right. His own near-death experience aside, there were still things to be done. He sat up and Alma flew into the air. Richter looked around for the first time since the battle had ended. What he saw was a charnel house.

The dismembered and hacked bodies of dozens of goblins dotted the area. The inevitable scents of blood, piss, vomit and shit filled the air. Even though he had been through several battles over the past few months, the horrible smells and sights still surprised him. Severed arms and legs lay next to their previous owners, and large wounds showed spilled viscera out over the ground. The flies had already found the site and were buzzing around, delighted in their feast.

This was the part of the battles that had never been portrayed in movies and TV shows he used to watch. Richter was actually surprised that he had been able to ignore the noxious potpourri for even a few moments and wondered what that said about him. What it said about who and what he was becoming.

Unfortunately, the goblins were not the only fatalities. Three of his guards lay unmoving on the ground, never to rise again. As he looked around, Richter realized that no one had made it through the battle unscathed. Everyone sported minor, and in a few cases major, wounds. Caulder was leaning back against a tree, and blood ran freely down his face from a scalp wound. He was awake, thankfully, and was being tended to by one of the Life magi. Almost all of the sprites had suffered wounds as well, though thankfully they all still breathed.

As dismayed as he was at the deaths of his men, Richter was relieved that it hadn’t been worse. They had attacked a numerically superior force and destroyed them. If nothing else, the battle had proven what his grandfather had told him when he a child. The plain speaking, retired soldier had been telling old war stories and had impressed one point on his wide-eyed grandson: there is no replacement for training and superior weaponry.

Thinking of the gruff old man almost brought a smile to Richter’s face, but then he continued looking around. In addition to the death and blood, he saw that to his right several trees were on fire. The flames were already in the process of being quelled, however, by a single, isolated cloud that was raining on that exact spot. Without being told, the chaos seed knew that his Companion’s Air magic was to thank for that. Gentle Rain might not be of much use in combat, but the versatile spell was showing its value in quelling a potential forest fire. Richter was especially glad of the rainstorm seeing as how the fire was his fault. His Weak Fireball spell was more than effective, but Sion was right. It couldn’t be used in a forest without consequences.

Another bout of goblin-speak caught Richter’s attention. His gaze shifted to a group of three goblin scouts and two of the larger goblin fighters that were bound hand and foot. At the end of the battle, it seemed his guards had been able to capture some of the enemy warband. The goblins were cursing and threatening his people even as some of the guards were starting to gag them. Richter didn’t know what the green-skinned captives thought they were accomplishing considering the fact that his people did not speak goblin, but then, maybe they weren’t that bright. The point was he had time to figure it out. The battle was done.

Richter reached an arm out, and Sion reached down to help him up. When the chaos seed was back on his feet, he was once again struck by how strange it was to have Sion be a foot taller than before. Even though the sprite was still only four and a half feet tall, it was a marked difference from before his Companion had undergone the meidon bonding. Before he could make an appropriately asshole comment about growth spurts, though, he was distracted by a sound of extreme disgust. Turning his head, Richter saw a sprite that was starting to gag and followed the woman’s gaze. His own eyes widened, and he shouted, “Stop!”

His shale adder, not at all bothered by the carnage of the battle, had uncoiled its body from the death lock it had had on the Witch Doctor. Apparently, the snake thought it deserved a little treat for its contribution during the battle and had laid claim to a particular piece of post- battle booty: the body of the goblin Mage. It had dislocated its jaw and was proceeding to ingest the caster feet first! The Witch Doctor’s face was still frozen in a leer of hatred that was only made worse by the bulging eyes and burst blood vessels that had resulted from being squeezed to death. It had to be Richter’s imagination, but the dead Mage seemed to be staring at him as the chaos seed’s tamed creature started to ingest it.

“I said stop!” Richter shouted for a second time. Everyone looked over at him, including the adder. Again, it had to have been in his imagination, but the snake’s eyes seemed to widen in innocence as if to imply that what it was doing couldn’t possibly be the cause of its master’s ire! The guiltless image it was trying to portray was obviously undercut by the fact that it had already swallowed the Witch Doctor’s body up to the knees.

“Yes, I’m talking to you!” Richter said, walking up to the creature. “Now drop it! How are you even supposed to get back to the village if you eat a whole goblin right here? I’d have to roll you back through the forest! Spit it out!”

He knew he wasn’t imagining it this time. The snake fixed him with an accusing and petulant gaze as it began to regurgitate the goblin. It wasn’t a fast procedure. The adder had to disgorge the goblin’s body inch by inch, and the process was accompanied by a wet shulck, shulck sound. The sprite that had been gagging, before, progressed to full vomiting. Soon one or two others joined her. Richter didn’t really blame them. His own face wrinkled in disgust. He realized that, once again, TV fell short of real life. This was not the way nature was portrayed on Animal Planet.

Once it was clear that it would obey, Richter turned his attention to helping with the healing efforts. Before he had taken more than a few steps, though, the sprite that he had rescued ran up to him. “Are you the leader of these people?”

Something about the sprite seemed off to Richter, or at the very least… different. The chaos seed used Analyze.

Name: LiddleRace: Hill SpriteDisposition: Neutral

Hill Sprites have several marked differences from their woodland cousins. Just as comfortable below ground as above, they have greater strength, but less agility than wood or forest sprites. Underground, they have had to engage in melee combat to a greater extent and are more comfortable with close quarters combat. They are also gifted with a limited darkvision. Hills sprites get three points to distribute per level, and each level gives +1 to Strength and +1 to Dexterity.

“I am the war leader and the Master of these lands, Liddle,” Richter asserted. “You may call me Richter. Before you say anything else, hold still a moment.” Raising one hand, the chaos seed focused his will and spoke a word of Power. Golden light enveloped his hand as he cast Weak Slow Heal. The hill sprite’s bruises and wounds began to disappear, and within seconds, most of them were gone. The relief on the small man’s face was immediate and obvious. Liddle’s shoulders relaxed, his breathing eased, and he looked at Richter gratefully.

With that done, the chaos seed continued, “Now. What do you need to tell me? And why were you being pursued by such a large warband?”

“Thank you for healing me, Lord Richter,” Liddle began. “There are many things I need to tell you, but first, I must warn you of the Bloodstone.”

Sion’s head whipped around, “A Bloodstone? Are you sure?”

The hill sprite gave Sion an inscrutable look for a moment but then answered, “I am sure. They have already begun the sacrifices, and they have held me captive for weeks. I felt the call of my meitu’meidon though. It gave me the strength to endure and escape.”

Sion’s face grew even more concerned and agitated. Seeing Richter’s questioning expression, he explained, “A Bloodstone is an object of Deep Magic. As far as I know, they can only be fully utilized by Blood mages, but sprite history is full of stories of other mages using them to breed havoc and ruin. They are relics from long ago. I do not know much about them, but one thing that holds true in all of the stories is how the stone gathers power. It must be bathed in heart’s blood.”

Liddle began nodding emphatically, “The wood sprite is correct, Lord Richter. They are killing people right now! That is why I need your help, and quickly! Thankfully, it seems the Bloodstone can only absorb the energy from one sacrifice per day, but other prisoners told me that dozens of sprites, humans and elves have already been sacrificed!”

“Where is their encampment?” Sion asked urgently.

“Do you have a map?” Liddle asked. “I can show you the rough location.”

Richter removed his Traveler’s Map from his bag and unrolled it. Currently, it showed a large swath of the forest. He zoomed out until Liddle was able to recognize landmarks. The hill sprite exclaimed in surprise, so the chaos seed quickly explained the properties of his magical map. Liddle nodded in understanding and stabbed his finger down on a location to the east.

With an exertion of will, the chaos seed made the map zoom in to that area. Liddle continued to help narrow down the location until he was able to point out exactly where the settlement was. It was Richter’s turn to be surprised. The encampment was only fifteen miles past the border of his domain. It meant there was an enemy village within thirty miles of his own. Even without the threat of this “Bloodstone,” he knew that a hostile encampment that close was something that would have to be dealt with.

Unfortunately, the area Liddle was pointing to showed only unbroken forest. To make matters worse, that portion of the map looked like it had been drawn with ink. That meant that the Traveler who had made the map hadn’t actually been to the area. Instead, that section of the map must have come from second-hand information. Specifically, another map that the Traveler had seen and whose information he had decided to add to the Traveler’s map. If the area had been in grayscale, that would have at least indicated that the information was based on firsthand experience, albeit experience that was hundreds of years out of date. Richter placed almost no trust in what he was seeing.

“Are you sure that is the location?” Sion asked Liddle. “All I see is forest.”

“I am sure,” Liddle responded, “and it is not surprising that the map shows only forest. The goblins are in a hidden valley. The entrance is easy to miss, and the trees grow tall. I would never have found it if those green-skinned devils hadn’t captured me. I have no idea how the goblins found the valley, but I promise you it is there.” There was no doubt in his voice.

Richter was about to ask more questions when Liddle grabbed his arm, “My brothers are still being held prisoner, and they are not the only ones! I do not know how many are there in total. I was kept in a cage near the wall, which is how I escaped. I do know that there are women and children also being held captive, Lord Richter. You have to save them!”

You have been offered a quest: Bloodstone I. Dozens, if not hundreds, of captives are being sacrificed to fuel an item known as the Bloodstone. Your Companion is clearly distressed by this. You have been charged by the hill sprite, Liddle, to save his family and the other captives. The problem is, they are in the middle of a goblin encampment. Reward: Variable, increases with the number of lives saved. Penalty for failure or refusal of quest: Large drop in regard from Liddle. Do you accept? Yes or No?

Richter gritted his teeth, but he still accepted the quest without hesitation. The truth was, he couldn’t afford to let an enemy base sit at his very doorstep. He had already decided that the goblins would have to be… removed. His frustration came from knowing that there were lives at stake. He was on the clock. The cold and analytical side of him was already measuring how many more lives he would allow to be sacrificed to maximize the success of an attack. He wasn’t a machine, though. Another side of him was beginning to be tortured thinking of child sacrifice. Richter shook his head; the urgency was something he could live without.

“I will do my best to save your people and all of the others,” Richter said. The relief on Liddle’s face was tragic. The sprite’s shoulders fell, and he started weeping quietly. The stress of running for his life while knowing that he was also running away from his loved ones must have been a horrible burden to bear. Now that the weight had been lifted, he could admit his mortality and feel the pain he had been ignoring. Richter did not want to take him from that place of relief, but he didn’t want there to be any misunderstandings.

“Liddle,” the chaos seed continued. The sprite looked up at Richter’s stern visage and nodded. “There are things I need to know. Before that, I need you to know that I will not rush blindly into danger, nor will I allow my people to go into danger without being properly prepared. We must return to our village and gather our strength.”

“But my family-” Liddle interjected. Richter raised a hand to cut him off.

“I will do everything I can for your family, but some of my men have already died to save you. We are battered and bloodied. We need to heal, know more about this encampment you described, and gather reinforcements. Any information you can provide will speed the time that we can move against the goblins and improve our chance of success. Now can you help? Can you be strong enough for your family, that you maximize their chances of survival?” Richter felt like an absolute monster for speaking so firmly to a man that was clearly suffering and sick with worry, but he would not just blindly rush into danger again. He would already be digging three graves that night. That was already three too many as far as he was concerned.

Indecision and impatience warred on Liddle’s face, but Richter’s words reached him. He nodded and his shoulders slumped again. Sion reached out a hand and laid it on the sprite’s shoulder, “Are you sure they only sacrifice one person a day?”

The hill sprite nodded, “Yes. I heard two of the goblins complaining about the fact that they couldn’t slaughter us all at once, but the Witch Doctor had made his orders clear.” Suddenly, Liddle’s face twisted in hate. “The green-skinned bastards! I will kill them all!”

“You will get the chance,” Sion promised grimly. “Have they already sacrificed someone today?” The sprite’s question might seem cold, but Richter realized that it was also pragmatic. Someone having died today meant that Richter could have as much as twenty-four hours to save the rest.

Liddle looked at him with pain in his eyes but still nodded. The fire went right out of the hill sprite. and he said with a voice colored with shame, “Yes. They kill each day at noon. All of the goblins get quite excited when it happens. I- I used the distraction today to escape as they sacrificed a human girl… I could still hear her screaming as I ran into the woods.” His eyes were haunted and guilty as he quietly added, “They like to take their time.”

“You did what you had to do,” Richter said in an understanding tone. “Though we will not be rushing off right this second, I promise you that we will save as many people as we can, your family included. Now, there are things I need to know. That was not a small strike group that was chasing you. Two Warriors, a Specialist Mage and dozens of goblin fighters is a small army. Even though I get why they would want to reclaim an escaped prisoner, it seems like overkill. Is there anything else I need to know?”

Liddle shook his head slowly, “I was surprised as well, Lord Richter. You already know of the Bloodstone.” He thought for a moment before speaking again. “The only other thing I can think of is an idle comment said by one of the guards. They spoke freely around the captives in goblin-speak. The fools were so smug! They did not know that I also knew some words in their foul language. There was much I did not understand, but I clearly heard them say they could not wait to get the ‘egg.’”

The hill sprite stopped talking. Richter stared at him, but nothing else was forthcoming. “Egg? Have they found some dangerous animal they can tame?”

“I cannot say, Lord Richter. I am sorry. The only other thing that I can tell you is that all of the prisoners were kept to the western side of the camp. When they led one of the captives away, it was to the south side, behind a second inner wall. I never got sight of what was behind that second wall.” Liddle paused for a moment. When he spoke again, it was with sadness, “No prisoners that saw what is past that wall ever came out alive again.”

Richter’s heart ached for the former POW, but he knew that there was still much to be done. He looked at his Companion, “Do you have any idea what ‘egg’ the goblins could have been speaking about? Are they raising monsters?”

Sion shook his head to show that he had no idea either. “It is not unheard of for goblins to use monsters to fight on their behalf, but it would not be a big secret. That would not explain such a large force coming after Liddle, and it certainly would not explain the presence of a Bloodstone.”

“I still don’t understand what the big deal is about this stone,” Richter said. “What does it do? Is it concentrated evil or something?”

Sion just shrugged again, this time with a bit of frustration. “I cannot tell you. All I know was that when I was a child, some of the scariest stories involved goblins using Bloodstones to power awful magics. In the stories, even weak Bloodstones give fighting bonuses to armies that possessed them. I do not think that the stones are inherently evil, but they are talismans of great power. The fact that the goblins have one at this settlement means that they greatly value whatever it is they have found.”

“So, it’s like a Magic Core?” Richter asked.

“I, DO, NOT, KNOW!” Sion bellowed. “We need to get back to the village and tell my mother about this!”

“Fine!” Richter responded irritated. Like any real brothers, he and Sion could really get on each other’s nerves. After a moment, though, he realized that he would have hated being asked the same question over and over as well. “You’re right, man. We need to get back. We still need to get eyes on the encampment, though. Liddle, how many goblins are in the encampment?”

The sprite let out a long sigh, “At least a hundred, Lord Richter.”

The chaos seed coughed, “Are you sure? A HUNDRED?”

Liddle nodded, “I am sure. I wish I was not. More are coming each day as they build up the fortifications.”

“Is that estimate including the thirty or so that we just killed?” Richter asked hopefully.

The hill sprite slowly shook his head. The chaos seed felt his already present headache worsen. At least a hundred was what the sprite had said. That meant there could be more goblins. It actually opened the door to there being any number of goblins greater than a hundred. That was like half of all numbers! Richter knew that that didn’t actually make sense in light of an infinite amount of numbers, but he wasn’t about to let logic get in his way! Sion was right. They needed to talk to Hisako.

Something else needed to happen, though. They needed information. Richter was about to tell Sion to lead his warband back to the village while he did some recon when a feminine and obstinate voice invaded his mind.

*No.*

Alma flew down and hovered only a foot in front of his face with strong beats of her dusky black wings.

*What do you mean ‘No’? No what?* Richter thought back.

*‘No,’ you are not running off through the wilds alone to face hundreds of goblins.*

*He only said a hundred goblins. Not hundreds, Alma. And I am the master here!*

*The sad sprite said at least a hundred goblins. That means it could be hundreds,* she retorted mentally.

Can’t really argue with that, Richter thought to himself. He decided to stick with the argument that he was the master. She beat him to the punch.

*I love you, master, but you are being foolish. I can fly undetected through the trees. Even though it will take me beyond the range that we can communicate, I will come back to you as soon as I have seen everything that I can and give you the images. Your map will be updated in color as if you saw it yourself. You need to get your warband home, master. I am the right choice for this mission.* Alma’s tone had started off feisty during this last mission, but it ended with the feel of calm acceptance as if she was telling him something that he already knew and could not possibly argue against. She was right.

Liddle was looking at Richter in confusion, but Sion was used to seeing that particular expression on his friend’s face. He knew that his Companion was speaking to the dragonling. Richter looked at both of them and said, “Alma is going to do some scouting for us. We will get back to the village, and once she returns, we will formulate a plan of attack.” Liddle looked even more confused until Sion explained who Alma was.

Richter looked at his familiar, *Be careful! I don’t know what I would do if anything happened to you.*

*You would most likely die immediately. If not because of your own stupidity, then because you would realize life would just not be worth living without me,* she thought back with a saucy attitude.

*You really are turning into a cocky little thing. Do you know that?* Richter thought to her fondly.

*They say monsters can always smell their own,* she retorted quirkily. *Master, you do not need to worry. I am not the creature you summoned those months ago. I am a level 34 dragonling. I am fast and cunning and beautiful. I will do you proud, master.*

Richter looked at his familiar with a tight feeling in his chest. He didn’t recognize it at first, then with surprise, he realized it was a particular mix of love and pride. *Then go, my love, and come back to me safely.*

Without further communication, Alma beat her wings hard and shot up into the air. In a moment, she was lost in the canopy above, but Richter heard her trumpeting cry as she quickly flew away to the east. Richter told Liddle to rest while they prepared to leave, and he and Sion set to helping their comrades. There was still healing to be done.





CHAPTER 3 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




Thirty minutes later, he had done everything that he could. Richter had even stopped a bleeding wound on one of the goblin prisoners by casting Weak Stabilize. Other, non-life-threatening injuries were left unhealed on the captives. Richter didn’t see any reason to make his prisoners stronger. It wasn’t like they needed to walk after all. Caulder made sure each goblin was gagged and bound tight upon his liege’s orders. After that, the chaos seed summoned a host of mist workers to carry both the living and the dead. Sadly, three of his guards would never rise again, Gregane, Amara and Nitol. His forces had won the day, but the mood of the war party was still somber.

His forces weren’t quite ready to leave, so Richter took the time to go through the equipment the goblins had been holding. The scouts and fighters had little more than crappy armor and rusted weapons. He still put it all in his bag, just in case his smiths could salvage anything. The three Professional goblins were another story. Each of them had been stripped of gear by his people, and their weapons and armor were laid in a pile before each of the bodies. Richter walked up to the body of one of the Warriors.

The gear was nothing to write home about, but the magic rings would be useful. It was gratifying to be able to identify magical gear without asking Futen for help. The fifteen Talent Points he had spent to unlock his identification Talents were well spent so far as he was concerned. He thought about what to do with the rings for a moment, but then a loud voice drew his attention. Looking over, he saw his sergeant, the war party Tank, giving commands to everyone that was still able to stand on their feet.

Without another thought, Richter called Caulder over. The sergeant jogged up and asked, “Sir?”

Richter handed him the rings. A look of shock came over the sergeant’s face at receiving such a gift. The chaos seed was confused at first by the man’s reaction. He had expected a thanks, maybe a grateful laugh, but not the intense look of gratitude that Caulder was giving him. Then he remembered how expensive even weak magic items were. These rings might cost three to five gold pieces each. When most guards and craftsmen earned less than one gold per month, it was easy to understand why his guard was impressed. It made the chaos seed feel good to help the sergeant, but it was also a reminder that he was becoming jaded with his access to magic. Still, it felt great when he received the following prompts.

Your generous gift has moved Caulder. You have gained 242 Relationship Points. Total Relationship Points: +26,517

Congratulations! Your relationship with Caulder has improved from Admiring to Trusting.

The sergeant smiled profusely, promising that he would put the rings to good use. Then he moved off and proceeded to shout at his men again, the personification of a perfect drill sergeant. At least now he was berating his men with a smile. Richter walked over to the next Warrior’s gear.

This second Warrior had been better equipped. There was no denying that the orichalum longsword was a solid weapon, despite its lacking enchantment. The steel and high steel armor also provided powerful defense. Each piece stank of goblin and had some rust on it, but it would still keep one of his guards safe in the future. Richter was happy to find the Belt of Agility and just wished that the enchantment had been on a piece of armor so he could feed it to the Forge.

The health rings would be helpful as well, but the Ring of Pain was fascinating and horrifying at the same time. He hadn’t even thought something like that was possible. He could see the utility in combat immediately. The seconds that an enemy reeled back in agony could be enough to finish them. What really disturbed Richter was that his mind was already leaning towards… other uses for the ring. He slipped all of them into his bag. The health rings would be gifts to the two families of the guards who had died. The Ring of Pain would stay with him. Richter turned his attention to the Witch Doctor’s gear. He had always been one to save the best for last.

There were also four other health rings that added less than seven points each. They were far inferior to the dead goblin’s +72 Ring of Health, but Richter supposed the logic was that every little bit helped. The chaos seed realized that these rings he was arrogantly dismissing might have given the Witch Doctor just enough life to enact a final attack. An attack that had almost killed him. It was another good reminder not to lose perspective. It brought a grim smile to Richter’s face as he thought about how his enemy was teaching him something. He looked at the dead body and thought, thanks, asshole.

Richter was tempted to hand the junk rings out to his people, but he decided to put them in his bag instead. He couldn’t just keep giving everything away for free. He planned to have Roswan build a marketplace soon. Low level magic rings would be exactly the kind of thing he could entice his villagers to buy with all the silver he had been paying them. He had been investing quite a bit into building his village. Paying hundreds of people to work and build it, while at the same time offering free food and housing was not cheap. He liked to think of himself as a long-term thinker, so he considered it the cost of doing business. At the same time, he wouldn’t mind seeing some of those coins coming back into his treasury, and people were more likely to spend money when they felt like they had money to burn.

Richter was about to walk away, but then he saw one more thing lying in the high grass: the broken remnants of the Witch Doctor’s necklace.



You have found:

Necklace of Spirit Bondage (Broken).

Durability: 0/88

Item Class: Scarce.

Quality: Superb.

Weight: 2.3 kg.

Traits: Any qualities of this necklace have been lost with its destruction.





Richter shook his head in irritation. He would have paid a lot to know how to capture the spirits of sentient beings, or, at the very least, to have a receptacle that could hold their souls. Sumiko had made it clear that she found the very idea of enslaving the souls of sentients to be abhorrent, but that was not surprising in light of the fact that she was a Life mage. Richter had to think about larger concerns than just right and wrong. If he ever came face to face with another chaos seed, or some of other type of immortal, he wanted to have a tool that could permanently take them off the board if they showed themselves to be a threat. Also, if he was being honest, the possibilities of enchanting with the soul of a sentient were… intriguing.

Unfortunately, it didn’t seem like the necklace would be of any help. It just looked like a series of small bones that had been threaded on a steel wire. Several of the bones were scattered on the ground. The Witch Doctor had snapped the item in a last-ditch effort to kill Richter.

As the chaos seed searched through the pieces on the ground, three of the bones stood out.; they were larger than the others and each was hollowed out. They also each held a crystal. The crystals were the same hexagonal shape as the soul stones he was accustomed to, but they were dusky black in color rather than amber. He checked each, hoping one was still viable, but all were severely cracked. He still dropped the necklace into his bag. Maybe it would come in handy in the future.

Richter took a moment and double-checked his gear to see if anything he had found would serve as a good upgrade.

It was the first time in a while that Richter had examined his own gear. He had come a long way since using that simple short bow Xuetrix had given him, he thought with a laugh. His weapons and armor were still the best items that he’d come across. The pure defense given by medium armor might be better, but the magical properties of his Enhanced Sprite Armor more than made up the difference. His rings, however, could use an upgrade.

Richter reviewed his gear for a few minutes before making a decision. He took off his +29 Ring of Health and Ring of Hidden Dangers. The trap detection bonus from his Ring of Hidden Dangers was like a warm safety blanket for him, but his own Pierce the Veil skill was now at level twenty-three. That would just have to be enough. There were battles on the horizon, and Richter decided to take the tangible benefit of increased health and mana over the boost to his already fairly high trap detection capabilities. He considered removing his Minor Ring of Healing as well, but the instant replenishment of lost health was still too important. Even if the thirty-four points it could restore constituted less than 5% of his total health, it could still keep him alive.

As he slipped the Witch Doctor’s health and mana rings onto his fingers, he felt vitality surge through his body and that intangible pool of magic inside of him deepen. His bag was heavy on his hip with the gear of dozens of enemies, but it was nothing he couldn’t handle.

Richter spent a few more minutes summoning more mist workers to carry the bodies of the dead and to help support the living. After that, he signaled for everyone to move out. His battered war party walked forward. Richter cast his gaze over everyone. His eyes lingered on the dead bodies of his guards being carried in the grey arms of his summoned creatures. He couldn’t help but ask himself if this was what victory would always look like.





CHAPTER 4 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




The party made its way west towards the village. Sion led the way. His body looked completely solid again now that the Potion of Gaseous Form had worn off. They moved slowly but steadily, and Richter dealt with the prompts that were waiting for him. The first several seemed to deal with increases in his skills that had happened during the fight. Richter’s smile grew as he read them.

Congratulations! You have reached subskill level 9 in Beacon. +90 to the Fighting Spirit of war party.

Richter dismissed the last of the prompts dealing with his skill leveling. The battle had been an amazing catalyst for his capabilities. His swords were now deadlier, and his magic was more powerful. He had also been able to progress from novice to initiate in three different skills! It still hurt seeing all the experience he was losing due to his experience penalty. His Specialist Talent, Talent Point Conversion, was a great way to advance his Profession quickly, but the penalty was seriously chaffing his ass. He had spent a whopping eight hundred and eighty-nine thousand experience points to gain more Talent points. As a result, all of the experience he gained after that trade was twice as hard to earn back. He still felt like he had made the right choice, but the loss of XP royally sucked.

The next prompt made him feel better.

You have been awarded 57,107 experience (base 1,305,294 x 0.07 x 1.25 x 0.5) from Brain Drain against Level 35 goblin Witch Doctor, Sin-ak; Station: Rikker.

Richter checked his status page. Including the XP from the Witch Doctor, he had gained over six hundred thousand experience points since using his Talent! He did some quick math and realized that he was almost 70% of the way to being free of the damn penalty! It put a bit of extra pep in his step as he walked through the forest. With nothing else to do, he examined the rest of the prompts.

For slaying fourteen Goblin Scouts, you have been awarded 28 War Points!

For slaying fifteen Goblin Fighters, you have been awarded 45 War Points!

For slaying two Professional Warrior Goblin Grinders, you have been awarded 40 War Points! (War Points multiplied by 5 for slaying a Professional)

For slaying one Specialist Witch Doctor Goblin Rikker, you have been awarded 50 War Points! (War Points multiplied by 10 for slaying a Specialist)

The war points were helpful, but honestly, Richter had been expecting more. The bonus from killing Professionals was awesome, and the Specialist bonus was bad-ASS, but how often could he expect that to happen? He didn’t like being a complainer, but he had just been expecting something more spectacular for killing sentient creatures. He would almost be better off hunting deer.

The war point allocation when he was hunting beasts or monsters was based on the soul level of the creatures. Poor soul animals gave one point, while monsters with luminous souls gave four points, etc. It looked like the Warriors that had been killed gave the same amount of points as a mid-level monster. Again, the 400% bonus was great and all, but it was still kind of disappointing. All of Richter’s misgivings faded away when he saw the next prompt, though. As he read it, a sound he hadn’t heard before echoed in his ears.

CLANG!

Congratulations! You have destroyed an enemy War Party! The War Leader’s rank was Apprentice. For killing a War Leader of the third rank, all War Points gained are tripled! War Points gained: 489. Total War Points: 601.

Now that’s what I’m talking about, Richter thought! He was definitely going to need a wallet that says ‘Bad Mother Fucker’ on it to hold all his war points from then on out! Even more prompts appeared.

Know This! For personally killing a War Leader one rank above you, you are randomly assigned two Promotions the enemy War Leader possessed (if the War Leader possessed two promotions that you do not already have). You will be given the lowest level of the gained promotions.

Congratulations! For slaying the War Leader, Si-nak, you have been awarded the Promotion: Weakness Equals Death I. Champions in your War Party have +5% attack and defense vs lower level opponents.

Congratulations! For slaying the War Leader, Si-nak, you have been awarded the Promotion: Slaughter the Innocent I. Killing noncombatants will increase the Fighting Spirit of your War Party for one hour. +5 Fighting Spirit for each life claimed.

Richter was immediately disgusted by the last prompt. He didn’t even want to think about how many helpless people the Witch Doctor must have killed to earn the promotion. He considered having the mist worker drop the dead Mage’s body so he could kick it. Somehow, he knew that striking the carcass with his feet wouldn’t make him feel any better, so the chaos seed just shut the issue from his mind. He did promise himself never to level the disgusting promotion, though.

The Weakness Equals Death I promotion could be helpful, on the other hand. Not many opponents had reached level thirty-one like he had. Even better, his new subskill, Army of One, let him access the perks from promotions even when he was fighting alone. His attack and defense had just gotten 5% stronger! To his delight, Richter found that his war party had earned one more promotion.

Congratulations! For destroying another War Party, your War Party has been awarded the Promotion: Battle Lord I. Champions in your War Party enjoy +1 to all Base Characteristics when battling against an enemy war party.

Hell yeah, Richter thought! His earlier complaints about the low number of war points earned for fighting sentients had completely faded away. Between the promotions he had won and the 200% increase from having destroyed an enemy war party, it was clear that the best way to grow his own War Leader capabilities was to fight enemies that also had the skill.

That kind of planning could wait, though. He had over six hundred War Points to spend! Richter accessed the badges he could purchase with a broad grin on his face. It was time to go shopping!





CHAPTER 5 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




Since gaining the War Leader skill, Richter had learned much more about the badges that were available to him. The first thing he had grasped was that his War Leader skill made an invisible bubble around him, called his Sphere of Influence, or SoI. That information had been nearly useless at first, but soon after, several things had had become clear.

Some badges, like Skilled Positions, worked independently of the sphere. Whoever he assigned to the various positions of Tank, Healer and Scout were able to use those powers even if they were beyond his SoI. For convenience, he called badges that worked like that “independent.” All of the other “dependent” badges fell into subcategories.

Power Level, for instance, only affected someone that was both in his war party and also within his Sphere of Influence. Richter had decided to call badges like that “closed.” The Movement Speed badge, on the other hand, worked on any friendlies inside of his SoI, even if they weren’t officially part of his war party. The fact that his war party could move so much faster in the forest now had really illustrated the importance of his Sphere of Influence. This type of badge was by far the most versatile. He had started thinking of them as “open.” A fourth category only affected him, like Lead by Example, so he called those “personal.” It had only taken a small tweak to his personal interface to add these descriptors into his war badge interface.

If Richter had his wish, he would have invested in another Skilled Position, but he just didn’t have enough war points. Also, the third tier of the badges were locked until he advanced his skill rank in War Leader so his eyes scanned over the other options.

The Movement Speed badge was obviously useful. That was why he had almost exclusively devoted his War Points to increasing the badge. Purchasing it required him to specify what type of terrain he would get the bonus on, but the choice had been easy seeing as how he lived in a forest. Gaining four ranks in the badge had greatly increased his ability to range around his domain. Now for instance, his party was travelling fairly quickly, despite being slowed by injury. Even the mist workers moved faster as long as they were close to him. The only problem was that each new rank was prohibitively expensive.

That led him to consider another badge. He could also strengthen his existing movement bonus by allowing more people to benefit from it. His gaze was drawn to the Sphere of Influence badge. This one was a no brainer. There was a large battle approaching, and letting more allies benefit from his open badges would definitely be a good idea. He purchased the badge.

Total War Points Remaining: 351.

The interface shifted to Sphere of Influence II and the new rank cost five hundred points. He would have liked to have bought it, but again, too expensive. War Leader badges were awesome, but they sure as shit weren’t cheap! The only ones that didn’t cost much were the bumps to melee, ranged or magical attack and defense. Those only caused a 1% change. It could definitely add up over time, but he needed something that could be a game changer for the upcoming battle.

He decided not to purchase anything else for the moment. Whatever recon intelligence Alma brought back might influence his decision. Who knew what the goblins’ defenses might be? Nope, better to spend his remaining points when he had more information. Thinking about his familiar, he reached out with his mind to check on her, but she was already beyond the range of their bond.

Richter quashed the worry that was starting to stir in his chest and instead focused on the rest of his prompts. The next one brought a surprised smile to his face.

Congratulations! A leader’s true strength stems from his followers. Two members of your War Party have distinguished themselves in battle and can now be promoted with Field Advancements! To activate these promotions, you must personally bestow them upon your party members.

For standing against a sea of countless foes and remaining strong, Caulder has earned the Field Advancement: Stem the Tide I. +1 Defense to each piece of Medium Armor worn by Sergeant Caulder.

For hand to hand combat against a dangerous and more powerful racial enemy, Sion has earned the Field Advancement: Bathe in Black Blood I. Sion will now have +1 damage when fighting goblins.

Congratulations! You have learned the subskill: Inspiring Leadership. Your leadership has led your war party members to perform superhuman feats! Continue to guide your people to increase both the chances of your war party earning a field advancement and the strength of field advancements when they do. This is a subskill of War Leader.

Congratulations! You have reached subskill level 2 in Inspiring Leadership. …

…

Congratulations! You have reached subskill level 4 in Inspiring Leadership. +5% to chance of war party members earning Field Advancements. +5% to the power of Field Advancements of any party members under your command or the command of your subordinates.

Congratulations! Your familiar has reached level 35!

War Leader was quickly becoming Richter’s most versatile skill, and as an added bonus, Alma had leveled! The chaos seed jogged up to Sion, “I’ve got something for you.”

Sion’s face was immediately guarded, not trusting the grin on Richter’s face, “What is it?”

Richter chuckled slightly, then immediately felt bad as he caught sight of the bodies of his dead guards. He had successfully distracted himself from that reality for a moment, but seeing the mist workers carrying the remains of his fallen soldiers sobered him. Sion’s face became inquisitive. Richter shook his head, “I’m fine, my friend.” He forced a weak smile back onto his face. “You have earned this. Thank you for fighting by my side.”

The chaos seed wasn’t sure exactly how to give the field advancement so he just reached out a hand and laid it on the sprite’s shoulder, hoping for the best. He wasn’t disappointed.

Greetings War Leader! Do you wish to bestow the Field Advancement: Bathe in Black Blood I on your Companion Sion? Yes or No?

Pleased that it was so easy, Richter mentally selected, “Yes.”

Sion’s eyes widened in surprise, then his old, vicious smile came on his face. “Thank you my friend. I will put this to good use very soon.”

Richter looked at the bodies again, “I think you will get a chance soon enough.” He started walking towards Caulder to hand out the other promotion, but one of the party’s forward scouts started screaming.





CHAPTER 6 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





The entire war party surged forward. Luckily, Caulder had had the presence of mind to order three of the fighters to guard their rear. Richter took a moment and silently thanked his lucky stars for being blessed with such a competent sergeant, and then he focused on sprinting towards the screams. They had been traveling through a small dell that ended in a steep hill. The forward scout had already climbed out and so Richter had no idea what was happening. The screams continued though, so he pushed himself to move as fast as possible. When the chaos seed finally crested the slope of the hill, what he saw made him cry out in anger.

A grey thing had caught ahold of his guard. It was five and a half feet tall and roughly humanoid in shape. The creature was skinless and was comprised of grey muscle that stood out like tightly wound wire. Each elongated arm ended in three six-inch claws. Two of those claws were currently embedded in the shoulder of his screaming elf guard.

The man had been forced to his knees by the monster. While being impaled by the claws must have been horribly painful, that was not what causing the elf to scream in agony and horror. The creature lacked a head. Instead, a vertical mouth was in the center of its abdomen. Long, sharp teeth lined both sides of the orifice, and it was in the process of feeding the guard’s non-impaled arm into its maw. The orifice closed and Richter heard the crunch of shattering bone.

The chaos seed’s shout did nothing to distract the monster from its meal, but the guard looked over pleadingly at his liege. The elf’s screams didn’t stop. The pain and horror of being eaten alive competed to shatter the man’s mind, but enough of him remained that his eyes beseeched his lord for aid. Richter sped up and drew his blade, letting that be his answer. Help had come.

Still twenty feet away, he cocked one arm back and threw his Elementum Short Sword of Freezing overhand at the monster. As the blade flew end over end towards the grotesque thing, he used Analyze.

Name: LugashDisposition: Hatred

A Lugash is a fiendish undead known for its horrible hunger and massive strength. These creatures possess an all-consuming hatred for the living matched only by their insatiable need to consume. Its thick skin is resistant to damage from baser metals.

Level: 14

Health: 420Mana: 80Stamina: 360

Strength: 34

Agility: 24

Dexterity: 23

Constitution: 42

Endurance: 36

Intelligence: 8

Wisdom: 5

Charisma: 2

Luck: 11





Richter’s blade flew true. The edge of clear green elementum of the blade struck the lugash in the side, sinking in. Unfortunately, the enchantment didn’t trigger, but the creature was still wounded. The mouth in the monster’s abdomen opened in a blood curdling scream and it turned quickly towards its attacker. Yanking its arm free of the guard’s shoulder, the elf’s other arm fell out of its mouth. The elf fell to the ground weeping and cradling his mangled hand. The monster knocked the blade free of its side and a black ichor began to ooze from the wound. The undead gave a shrill screech of defiance and rushed at Richter, claws outstretched.

Richter drew his other blade, but didn’t rush to meet it. He heard more of the distinctive screeches behind him. Praying that his people’s enchanted weapons were up to the task of killing the creatures, he cast Weak Life Aura on himself and ordered his shale adder to attack one of the monsters behind him. A golden glow sprung into life around him. The battle was joined! The lugash swiped at him with one hand, its claws blurring in the air. The speed of the monster was frightening. Or it would have been, if Richter wasn’t faster still.

The chaos seed raised his Sonic Elementum Short Sword. With all of the attack speed afforded by his thirty-eight points of Dexterity, coupled with the 24% boost to attack speed from his twelve skill levels in Small Blades, Richter swung his green blade. The weapons whistled while it cut the air. His sword met the claws of the monster, stopping the attack cold. It shrieked when the green blade scored deeply against its talons. The reinforced nails were too strong for him to cut all the way through, but Richter was still able to push the claw back.

Without even seeing the monster’s second attack, Richter immediately swung his sword in a backhand to block the other claw he knew had to be coming. His daily training paid off. While he was blocking the first two strikes with his blade, his free hand twisted into a spell form, and he shouted, “IGNI!”

A gout of orange-yellow flame shot from his hand. Richter aimed it at the monster’s yawning maw. The damage from the low level spell was not enough to take off an appreciable amount of the creature’s health, but the lugash shared the near universal aversion that all undead had for fire. It reared back, screaming. Richter pressed his attack.

The chaos seed swung his sword at its left leg. The clear green metal sliced deep into its calf. Again, the wound was eerily dry. Only a small amount of black blood, if you could call it that, oozed from the wound. Bloodless or not, the monster shrieked even louder before. It turned its body away in an effort to protect its vulnerable mouth from Richter’s conjured flame. While its back was partially turned, the war leader shoved his sword completely into its body. This proved to be a mistake.

The lugash accelerated its simple turn into a spin, and caught Richter with a backhand that sent him crashing to the ground. His short sword remained embedded in the monster’s body. Before he could recover, it pounced on him, pinning his body beneath it. The brute’s claws descended and Richter grabbed the last weapon he had readily available, his Moonstone Dagger of +3. He awkwardly stabbed upward with the white blade while grabbing one of the creature’s wrists with his other hand. The remaining taloned hand scored a vicious cut along his brow before he could yank his head out of the way, but Richter ignored the pain. He focused instead on what seemed to the monster’s only vulnerable spot, its mouth. Forgetting how stupid the move probably was, he jammed the fourteen-inch blade past its teeth and into the flesh on the inside of the monster’s mouth.

The cream-colored weapon sank easily into the soft palate. Unlike the unnatural hardness of its external skin, the inside of the lugash proved more than vulnerable to damage. Richter quickly snatched his hand back, leaving the dagger buried inside of the monster. Its horribly sharp teeth slammed together milliseconds after he had removed his hand from danger. The chaos seed might be bold, but he had no intention of losing a limb to the beast!

While his initial dagger strike had caused damage, it was nowhere near as much as when the beast drove the blade deeper into its own body by slamming its jaws shut. Once again, it reared back, shrieking in agony. Richter continued to hear screams from behind him, but he couldn’t help them until he brought a true death to his enemy. While he stood, Richter used Analyze again and saw that it only had forty-eight health left. He quickly cast Soul Trap and then started to dual cast three spells in a row: Weak Lightning, Weak Life Bolts and Weak Flame. “Fulgit! Virteas! Igni!” Richter’s mana dropped at a prodigious rate, but his magic got the job done. Ten seconds later, the lugash had been stunned, blasted, seared and most importantly, slain. A rainbow-colored ribbon of light swirled into the air before disappearing into his bag.





CHAPTER 7 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





Richter barely noticed trapping the monster’s soul. His mind and soul were bound to this battle, and he would find no rest until it was done. He rushed forward to pick up his two priceless blades and turned around to view his war party. After months of fighting, the chaos seed took in the scene in an instant. What he saw made his stomach drop.

Four more of the creatures were attacking his war party. The guards had clustered together and, for now at least, were holding off one of the monsters. His adder had risen up behind it and was preparing to strike. The other three monsters were preoccupied… with ripping apart the goblin captives and the mist workers that had been holding them. It was the bound, green-skinned prisoners that had been screaming. In the back of his mind, it occurred to him that once upon a time he might have judged his soldiers for sacrificing helpless prisoners to save themselves. Now, though, he was just hoped it took the monsters a long time to tear the goblins to bloody bits. Anything to buy more time. A darker part of him wished that he had captured more goblins. Then there would be more for the undead to eat.

A moan drew his attention back to the elf that had been savaged by the now truly dead lugash. Richter reached into his bag and mentally selected the items he wanted. A moment later he held five potions, three blue and the last two red. He quickly downed the mana potions and one of the health potions. His pool of available MPs swiftly started refilling. The forty-five points of Wisdom he had and his Ring of Flowing Thought let him regain thirty-two points of mana per minute. It was nothing to scoff at, but it still wasn’t fast enough.

Luckily, his mana potions were no weak tinctures. They each restored one hundred and ninety-six magic points over seventeen seconds. Between the three potions, the regen should be enough for the next round of combat. The health potion closed his scalp wound and restored the full amount of health he had lost during his brief fight with the powerful undead.

The last potion he fed to his elf guard. The man was delirious with pain, but still followed his lord’s directions and swallowed the red solution. Richter looked at his face and remembered that his name was Tovar. More screams and shouts echoed behind him, and the chaos seed knew he couldn’t think of just this one man. Still, he could do one more thing, though. Tovar’s mangled hand was continuing to bleed freely, despite the health potion. The chaos seed cast Weak Stabilize. The blood flowing from the elf’s ruined hand slowed to a trickle.

Richter silently prayed that Tovar would be safe until the fight was over, but he couldn’t waste any more time. Both swords went back into their sheaths on his back, and he started running towards his war party. As he ran, his hands started weaving into a dual cast spell form. During his training over the past few weeks, he had tried to cast spells while moving and had found it greatly increased the chance of a spell miscast. This time, though, his skill and familiarity with the spell proved equal to the task. A green disc appeared in the air in front of him, and a moment later, a forest elemental appeared. The saproling took the form of a stag this time, five feet tall at the shoulder. Its horns were wickedly sharp and were a lacquered brown. After making eye contact and forming a mental bond, Richter gave it a psychic command. The elemental sprung ahead of him to join the fight. His mana pool dropped again, but it was worth it.

One of the monsters was wrapped tight in the coils of the adder’s body. Its left arm was relatively free, but the other was trapped tight against the lugash’s body. It clawed at the tamed reptile with its free hand, but lacked an angle to do any real damage. Conversely, the shale adder squeezed as tightly as it could, but did no real damage to the undead’s body. The snake’s main attack was not suited for use against creatures that did not need to breathe. The two monsters were in a stalemate. Despite this, the snake was having more luck than Richter’s guards.

The goblins had been literally torn apart. None of the remaining pieces were larger than a soccer ball. One lugash remained at the bodies, stuffing flesh that dripped with black blood into its ragged mouth. The other two were attacking his people. Caulder had organized them into a block formation, the guards with shields in front. Richter saw one guard swing a heavy blow with a high steel mace at a lugash, but the weapon just bounced off. In a swift counterattack, the undead swiped downward with its claws. The guard fell screaming. One of his eyes was simply gone.

Caulder shouted for everyone else to close ranks. He struck the other lugash with his Quicksilver Spiked Mace of Goblin Slaying. The fluidic metal achieved a much better result than the other guard’s high steel mace, despite the enchantment not having any effect. The monster shrieked in pain. It was about to strike back at the sergeant, but Richter’s saproling arrived.

The stag rammed into the undead, leading with its wickedly sharp antlers. While the monster’s body could resist steel, the hardened magical wood of the elemental’s natural weaponry was enough to pierce its body. The level twelve saproling lifted the undead in the air while it continued to shriek. It lashed out with its clawed hands at the saproling’s head. The attack gouged deep grooves into the leaves and roots that comprised the elemental’s body. In anger, the summoned creature threw its head to the side, and the lugash flew off of its antlers. The undead crashed into the ground, and the elemental wasted no time spearing it again.

The last lugash attacking the guards was swiping at the shields of the guards and shrieking in frustration. Sion swiped at its legs, but his thorn-like rapier just bounced off. Thankfully, the sprite was able to dodge out of the way of the undead’s return strike. Caulder struck it with his mace, but though the monster was hurt, it did not seem critically so. The strike, coupled with Caulder’s position as the war party’s tank, did attract the attention of the lugash and for a few seconds it ignored everyone else. That was all Richter needed.

The chaos seed’s steps were nearly silent thanks to the Silence enchantment on his Reinforced Sprite Boots. The monster did not even notice him until Richter executed the sword form, Samara Seed Falling. The chaos seed bent low, and both of his powerful blades bit into the back of the lugash’s left leg. They did not cut all the way through the tough flesh, but they did most of the work. As it shrieked in pain, Richter straightened and moved past the undead. Almost disdainfully, he kicked out and down.

The strike was enough, and the lugash monster collapsed. Richter tossed his Elementum Short Sword of Freezing to Sion. A quick incantation primed the fallen creature’s soul to be trapped. Trusting in his Companion, Richter just said, “Finish it.” Sion and Caulder both stepped forward with grim expressions, glaring death at the undead.

Richter sent the healers and the other guards to retrieve Tovar. He walked over to his adder, still squeezing the lugash. The part of its sinuous body that the undead could reach had been savaged, but still the tamed creature squeezed as tight as it could. Richter ran forward and grabbed the monster by the wrist. He swung his sword down, once, twice, three times. The arm came free and black ichor splashed on the ground. Muffled shrieks reached Richter’s ears from inside of the adder’s coiled embrace. “Scream all you want, muthafucka. You’re done!” Richter spat.

One of his hands wove into a Life spell form, and Richter cast Weak Slow Heal on his tamed pet. Then he sent a mental command, and it began to loosen its body somewhat. Richter cast Soul Trap again and plunged his sword through the loops. The chaos seed couldn’t skewer it completely for fear of hitting his pet when the sword exited the other side. Instead, he angled his blade and stabbed up into its body over and over until a rainbow of light appeared. Richter drank another mana potion and cast Summon Weak Life Wisp. A ball of healing energy appeared and immediately began healing the snake again. He picked his head up to find the last two lugash. One had run off taking large chunks of bloody goblin with it. Unfortunately, the last one was on its feet. Everyone could see that the saproling had not fared so well.

The undead monster was shambling back towards Richter and his guards. Behind it were the remains of the saproling, looking like so much mulch. One of the deer’s antlers was still sticking out of the lugash’s side and leg. Richter was about to run and meet it, but his sprite archers finally unleashed their power. The monsters had been too close to his guards before. Now, however, the sprites could fire their imbued arrows with impunity.

Four arrows glowing blue with charged power struck the monster in its shrieking mouth. Teeth flew everywhere as one of the arrows detonated inside of its body. It was blown backward and the air was rent with a loud Boom! The lugash slammed against a tree and crumpled to the ground. They all watched for a moment, and it started to move again.

His meidon sprites began to prepare another volley, but Richter called out that they should wait. He walked close enough to cast Soul Trap for a fourth time. The lugash’s body glowed gold for a moment as the spell took hold. It appeared that purple-back light was coming from the undead’s skin for a moment, fighting against the golden glow, but the bright light ultimately was absorbed into the monster’s body.

Defiant to the end, the lugash reached an arm up towards Richter, weak and near true death. With a baring of his teeth, Richter kicked the arm out of the way and stepped closer. His blade plunged down through the monster’s back, in line with where its mouth should be. The elementum blade sank between the bands of grey muscle. A short twist later and the undead lay still. Once more, a rainbow of light spun through the air.





CHAPTER 8 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





“Are there any more?” Richter asked, looking around. No one responded, still reeling from the ferocious attack. “Are there any more?” he asked again, but with the bark of command.

“One escaped, my lord,” Caulder responded. He had a bruise darkening on his cheek, but was otherwise whole. “Do we pursue it?”

Richter shook his head. He wouldn’t risk his men’s lives to hunt something already dead. “How are Tovar and Chakone?” he asked. The guard whose face had been marred was moaning slightly as he held his face.

“Alive, my lord,” the sergeant replied tiredly and with resignation.

Richter nodded, worn out as well, but now was not the time for rest. He started summoning mist workers, dipping into the thousand-point mana pool of the village for the first time in a good while. As far as the chaos seed was concerned, every moment spent away from the village was a moment that allowed for another attack. These undead were not the strongest monsters he had faced, but their resistance to most physical attacks made them insanely dangerous. They were certainly deadlier than most of the monsters he had encountered in his domain so far. The fact that they were undead, and were attacking during the day, didn’t make him feel any better. He knew that he had to discuss this with Hisako.

Less than two minutes later, the war party was on its way again. Caulder had asked if he wanted to do anything about the remains of the goblins. The chaos seed shook his head. The only thing he felt about the dead goblins was regret that he didn’t get any War points from their deaths. Richter took a moment to retrieve his moonstone dagger from the body of the first monster he had killed and let his summoned constructs carry the bodies of the lugash. Another carried Tovar. The eviscerated remains of the dead goblin captives were left behind.

The party traversed the remaining miles back to the village without incident. All of their nerves were frayed by the time the white stone walls of the settlement came into view. Richter, himself, breathed out a sigh of relief, and a bundle of tension he hadn’t even recognized was there eased in his neck. The battered group of warriors skirted the trench surrounding the village until they reached a bridge. The guards stationed there shouted in dismay when they saw the dead bodies and rushed out to help. Richter ordered one guard to go ahead of them in order to notify the healers that they were back and that there were casualties.

As the chaos seed looked at the guard with the ruined face, it hit him that if Sumiko had been in the village, then she might have saved his eye. Nexus’s practical joke of taking multiple villagers for their Trials at once just might mean the man might be partially blinded for the rest of his life. Instead of relying on his trusted village healer, Richter had to hope that Hisako could, and would, heal the man. It was true that they were allies, but the chaos seed had become more pragmatic in recent days. He no longer simply assumed that another ruler would necessarily take the time to heal his people. He cast Cure Weak Disease on both injured men in the hopes that it would help their recovery, then the entire party started walking into the village.

Richter ordered another guard to find Randolphus, and took a moment to give Caulder his field promotion. The sergeant nodded gratefully to his lord, but his face was stricken. The chaos seed completely understood. Though they had won the day, it had not been without cost. He let the man organize the guards, and then Richter turned his attention to the hill sprite.

The chaos seed ordered a guard to lead Liddle to the healing tent. He also asked the hill sprite to hold off on forming the meidon with his pixie until Hisako could speak with him about the goblin encampment. Liddle looked longingly at his pixie, but nodded in acquiescence. Though the sprite clearly yearned to bond with his meitu’meidon, he understood that what he knew could mean the difference between life and death for the other prisoners. Satisfied, Richter sent one more guard running ahead to find the Hearth Mother and ask her to attend the injured at the House of Healing. He prayed that the Life Master could bring his guard back to full fighting strength.

With all of that done, Richter and Sion walked off together alone. Both men were weary from the battles of the day. It was nearing dusk and the two shared a brief moment of silence as they walked, reflecting on everything that had just happened. Once they were back inside the inner village wall, Sion returned Richter’s elementum short sword. The sprite had held onto it after the lugash attack, needing a weapon until they were safely back in the settlement. “I guess you’ll be wanting this back?”

Richter heard a faint note of regret in his friend’s voice as he proffered the weapon, but what was truly notable was his friend’s use of a conjunction. It was a strange quirk that people of The Land did not seem to use that linguistic practice, though they never seemed to have a hard time understanding him when he did. The chaos seed found it slightly amusing that he was rubbing off on his friend.

He took the green blade back from his Companion. They kept walking but with his other hand, he took a handful of soul stones from his bag. They were all filled with poor and weak level souls. Richter expended the stones refilling the charges on the blade, and each turned to dust as the souls were expended. The Freeze enchantment greatly improved the damage and deadliness of the weapon, but the enchantment needed to be fueled. Each enchanted weapon had a finite amount of charges and each time it struck an enemy, some of the charges were expended.

Since Richter had started enchanting weapons regularly, he had found that the stronger the enchantment, the more charges were used up per hit. The enchantment on his sonic sword, for instance, was much stronger than the Freeze enchantment because he had used concentrated crystal to enchant it. Even though it had more charges than his freeze blade, it was almost continually running out of charges due to that increased strength. Like all things in The Land, there were checks and balances. Having enchanted weapons made you a powerhouse, but it was an expensive advantage to maintain.

The enchantment on the elementum blade greedily drank in the soul stuff from the amber gems. Each stone only restored a few charges before crumpling to dust. Given enough time, the charges would have restored on their own, but it could take days or even weeks. That wouldn’t do with what he had in mind for the weapon.

Once the full charge was restored, he stopped walking and asked if he could see Sion’s rapier. His friend’s blade was a sprite weapon. It looked like it was made of hardened wood and looked like nothing so much as a long thorn. There was no denying its deadliness though, and the sprite had claimed many lives with his sword. Still, the weapon was looking a bit the worse for wear.

You have found:

Sprite Rapier.

Damage: 6-9 (Max 14-18)

Durability: 19/53

Item Class: Uncommon.

Quality: Well Crafted.

Weight: 1.1 kg.

Traits: This weapon has been created with Earth magic. It is considered a magic weapon and will give extra damage to Air creatures.





“You’ve kinda been rough on it, don’t you think?” Richter asked with mock judgement in his voice.

“Hmpf. We can’t all have weapons made of fey metal,” Sion retorted. “The flesh of those undead bastards was ridiculously hard, not to mention that parrying the attacks of a goblin Warrior is not exactly easy.”

“But you did it,” Richter said. “You took them both down and you’re still standing.”

Sion puffed his chest out. It was even more comical when contrasted with the exhausted look in his eyes. He still managed a cocky and clear bravado when he said, “Of course I did. That is what we do, right, brother?”

Richter smiled wearily back, “Hell yeah it is. That’s exactly why I think that you need an upgrade.” He handed his Elementum Short Sword of Freezing back to his friend.

The sprite’s eyes widened, “Are you sure?”

“I am,” Richter replied firmly. “We are in this together.” The chaos seed closed his eyes and concentrated for a moment. A prompt appeared.

Do you wish to transfer ownership of the Elementum Short Sword of Freezing? Yes or No?

Richter selected “Yes.” Then he opened his eyes and extended a hand with his palm flat. It had cost a fair amount of soul stones, but Richter had soul bound all of his armor and weapons over the past few weeks. Despite the cost, it had given him great peace of mind. If he ever died again, god forbid, at least he knew when he was reborn, all of his items would come back with him. Specks of light gathered above his palm and spun around quickly before coalescing into a clear gem.

You have abdicated ownership of the Elementum Short Sword of Freezing. Safeguard the Crystal of Ownership. Whomever takes ownership of the crystal will be able to soul bind this object and will become its new owner.

Richter handed the crystal over to Sion and the sprite’s eyes lit up. It was almost like he thought the chaos seed had been messing with him until he saw clear proof. Richter was tempted to give his friend shit about that, but the sprite was clearly moved so he decided not to ruin the moment. With a smile on his face now, Richter’s Companion clasped the crystal in his fist. White light seeped out from the edges of his fingers before disappearing. When Sion opened his hand again, the crystal was gone, and the sword had a new owner.

“This is an amazing gift,” Sion said softly. He swung the short sword through the air, marveling at how the clear green metal caught the fading light.

“You deserve it,” Richter said sincerely. Then his face took on a wry twist, “You know, I would have done this earlier, but I thought it might be too much blade for you. Now that you’re all grown up though,” he said, referencing the extra foot of height Sion had gained since bonding to his pixie, “I’m sure you can handle a big boy weapon.”

Sion nodded sagely, “I can understand why you would feel that way. Every time you pee, you have to hold a very little sword. Over time, you must have started thinking that was normal.” The sprite held the short sword at waist height and slowly raised the point. “The rest of us are used to holding something larger.”

Richter rolled his eyes, “You know what, my friend, I’ve had it up to here with you. Actually,” he held his hand flat at chest level, “I’ve had it up to here with you.”

Sion shook his head, “Little joke from such a big man.”

“Ah! So you admit I’m big?” Richter said savoring victory.

The sprite’s face took on a chagrined look and he glanced at Richter’s midsection, “I misspoke. I meant ‘Little joke on such a big man.’ Then Sion gave Richter his best smarmy smile.

Richter went back to short jokes, “You know, you really should stand up when you talk to me…”

Sion shook his head in disgust, “Pathetic. You can do better than that. For instance, …”

The two friends kept walking and found solace in their mocking camaraderie. Both knew however, that bloody deeds and savage days loomed dark on the horizon.





CHAPTER 9 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





A few minutes later, the two friends went in different directions. Sion decided to take his new weapon to be honed at the Forge. Though to an outside observer the two had just been mocking each other, what they had actually been doing was reaffirming two simple truths. One, that neither of them were alone and two, that they would meet whatever dangers were coming, together. The Companions clasped wrists before they separated, and both felt better than they had when they first caught sight of the village.

Richter made his way to the catacombs. He had to speak with many people, and his Chamberlain was first on the list. Now that he was safely back in his village, he looked at the last of the prompts he had left to read.

You have trapped the soul of a Lugash! Soul level: Luminous. x 4

As horrible as the beasts had been, having another four luminous stones was nothing to turn his nose up at. He checked his inventory to see exactly how many captured souls he had. The count was sixty-one poor, forty-three weak, two hundred and two basic, one hundred and thirty-nine common, fourteen luminous, three brilliant, four special and one resplendent stone. Richter was actually surprised by how many he had been able to collect. The daily hunting of the lands around the village had paid off. Many of the poor and weak souls were actually in soul stones that could hold up to basic level souls, but that was because Richter used small pieces of marbled quartz to make his repositories. It was a bit of a waste using soul stones to capture souls smaller than their maximum capacity, but the marbled stone was so plentiful that it was the best option.

With his current Talents, he could use three soul stones per enchantment. One of the reasons that he had been grinding so hard was that he had an unresolved quest. Krom had charged him with obtaining enough high level souls that the dwarf could finish the skeeling armor and have it enchanted with powerful protections. If Richter used only common stones, he already had more than enough to enchant all six pieces of the armor set.

The problem was, enchanting was a one-shot deal. You got multiple chances for an enchantment to take hold as long as you were within the time window, but once it sunk in, that was it. Ideally, he would use luminous souls or higher, but monsters of that level were not easy to find, and they were even harder to kill. Still, Richter knew that he couldn’t wait forever. The goblin settlement was just the latest in a long line of multiplying enemies. He resolved to talk to Krom as soon as the dwarf got back from his Trial.

There was one final prompt blinking in the corner of his vision, but as he had reached the catacombs, he decided to wait before accessing it. The guard stationed at the entrance saluted, clapping one fist to her chest. Richter returned the salute and kept moving. After walking down a long hall for several hundred meters, he once again stood in the room of the Great Seal.

Richter took a moment to look at it. What had begun as a simple mosaic had turned into a pulsing representation of his awakening Powers. The pattern was comprised of four spirals that met in the center of the design. Two of the spirals depicted Air and Life magic. These both throbbed with light. The other two spirals, which represented Water and Dark magic, remained only inert tile. It might have been Richter’s imagination, but whenever he saw the giant symbol, he felt a faint compulsion to awaken the final two spirals. In recent weeks, it had started to even feel like the tiles were reproaching him for not bringing them to life. Richter knew that was crazy… but still.

He walked past the seal and into one of the side tunnels. A few seconds later, he was standing in front of Randolphus’ office. The chamberlain was bent over his desk, furiously scribbling on a piece of paper. It was a scene that had become as familiar and comforting to him as seeing a father sitting in his favorite chair. Richter smiled at seeing the oblivious man. He ultimately had to rap his knuckles against the door frame more than once to announce his presence.

Randolphus looked up in surprise. The man was a marvel of organization, but it wasn’t uncommon for him to get lost in a world of documents and papers. Randolphus recovered quickly and stood up with a smile on his face, “Welcome back, my lord. The retrieval of the sprite took longer than expected. I trust…” The chamberlain’s voice trailed off as he saw the weary look on Richter’s face.

“Sit down, my friend,” the chaos seed said. “We need to talk.” Once they were both settled, Richter clued his chamberlain into everything that had happened that day. He started with the deaths of the three guards and then spoke about the two guards that had been injured in the lugash attack.

Randolphus sighed heavily, “I can see that the deaths of the guards are weighing on you.” Richter nodded, and the chamberlain just sat in silence with him for a minute. When he continued, his tone was understanding but educational. “These things will happen, though, my lord. They will continue to happen. The wilds are dangerous. From what you have told me, the fact that we live upon a Place of Power means that monsters will continue to be attracted to our settlement. I am honestly surprised that we have not had more fatalities.”

Richter understood what Randolphus was trying to do, but it didn’t make him feel any better. “I cannot keep losing people,” he said quietly. “It was my fault that the bugbears got into the village.”

“But it is not your fault that these three guards died,” Randolphus said, cutting him off. His voice was gentle but firm. “I do not know where you are from, my lord, but I have been able to tell that you are new to this part of the world.” He paused for a moment, allowing Richter to respond. The chaos seed kept quiet, though, and after a few second Randolphus continued. “The truth of the matter is that The Land is a world of violence. Death has always come on swift wings. You have come far since the night of the attack, my lord, both as a man and as a leader. Still, no matter how far you progress, you cannot change reality. It reflects well on you that the deaths of your men weigh upon you, but losses are inevitable.”

The two of them sat in silence for a few minutes while Richter digested his chamberlain’s words. The man’s counsel didn’t make the chaos seed feel any better, but it did remind him of his duty. Ultimately, he realized that Randolphus was correct. Richter had always known that building his village would require sacrifices. All he could do now was to work hard to minimize future losses and honor those who had fallen.

“I want a ceremony tonight,” Richter said. “Everyone should be gathered in front of the memorial wall, and we will add the names of the dead. We will honor those who have fallen. I also wish to speak with their families before the ceremony. Make sure you let Terrod know as well.”

“It will be done, my lord,” Randolphus said with a bow of his head. He picked up a pen, “What were their names?”

“Gregane, Amara, and Nitol,” Richter replied. He said each name slowly, tasting them as he spoke.

Randolphus began to consult his notes, “Gregane was single. Amara was among the group of guards that came to the village with Sergeant Caulder. She has a husband here, but no children. Nitol…” Randolphus sighed heavily, “Nitol has a wife, my lord. She is pregnant.”

Richter felt his heart drop. It took a moment for him to collect his thought and emotions. Once he had control again, he said, “The families of the dead will receive the entire stipend for the year of work their loved ones agreed to. If any family of Gregane ever show up, they will be given his stipend as well. I also want it made clear that Amara and Nitol’s families will be well provided for, so long as I lead this village.”

“It will be done, my lord,” Randolphus repeated with another short bow of his head. “You can rely on me.”

“I know that I can,” Richter said without hesitation, “but now I need to tell you the rest.” He went over the attack by the lugash and Liddle’s report about the goblin settlement. The chaos seed then shared his suspicions that the Dark portal leading to the necromancer’s lair might be behind the increase in undead monsters in the area. He finished by saying, “I need a war council put together tonight. Have everyone meet in the conference room after the ceremony. Assemble the usual people. I will need their council.”

“Who, exactly,” Randolphus said delicately, “would you like me to gather?”

Richter was confused for a moment by the question. Obviously, he would want Krom, Sumiko, Quasea… Then it came flashing back to him that almost all of the village leaders had been taken by Nexus in one fell swoop, just that morning. With everything that had happened, it seemed like months ago. The chamberlain was right, though, some of his best people would be gone for up to a week. He slammed his fist down on the table in frustration and cursed Nexus’s name.

“I’m sorry, Randy. I forgot for a moment. Just bring Terrod, Caulder, Hisako, Yoshi, Sion and Tabia. Also, include the hill sprite Liddle. He will be undergoing the meidon later. You will most likely find him by the Quickening.”

“Not the elders?” the chamberlain asked.

Each of the races represented in the village had an informal leader. The elders frequently represented them and brought concerns to Randolphus. In the past, their aid had been invaluable, but Richter just couldn’t get past the feeling that letting them take a more active role in village affairs might lead to problems down the road.

Richter shook his head, “We have things to get done, and I don’t want this to turn into a town hall meeting. There are decisions to be made. It is clear that we need to take care of the goblin settlement. The undead attacks must be dealt with as well. Those lugash were horrible. If I didn’t have my elementum blades, they might have killed us all.”

“I understand, my lord. Is there anything else that I can do to help now?”

Richter shook his head, “No. Alma is doing reconnaissance, and she is still beyond the range of being able to communicate with me. She should return in the next few hours, though. There is no point in any further planning until I can provide accurate and up to date information on the goblin camp. That does remind me, though. Have Bea here after the ceremony as well. I need him to upload the latest map data into the Knowledge Table.”

“It will be done, my lord.”

Richter thanked his chamberlain and then left the catacombs. There were still many things that needed to be done, but one was at the front of his mind. He needed a new weapon.





CHAPTER 10 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





Futen found him before he left the catacombs. The orb started floating along beside him.

“Greetings, my lord,” the remnant said in his monotone voice.

“Futen,” Richter responded, “has anything happened in the past day that I should be aware of?”

“Three strike teams hunted outside of the city in addition to your war party, Lord Richter. Two were able to bring back deer. The third suffered an attack from some type of large insect, but they prevailed with only minor injuries.”

Richter nodded, “Anything else?”

“Nothing of note, my lord,”

“Well at least there’s that,” Richter said. He told the remnant about the goblin settlement and that there would be a meeting that he should be at later. The chaos seed also told him to find the families of the dead guards and to bring them to the Quickening. The orb floated off.

Villagers greeted their lord with smiles on their faces. He put a false smile on his face and waved back, but his heart was still heavy. Richter made his way to the Forge of Heavens. Cherry red glows could be seen from the inside of the building, and the sound of hammers striking anvils echoed out despite the late hour. When he entered, the dwarven and human smiths all greeted him with nods and gruff hails, but they stayed at their tasks. This didn’t bother Richter at all. A smithy was not a place to let one’s attention wander. A momentary lapse in concentration could lead to injury.

One thing that did surprise the chaos seed was that someone was working at the main anvil. He hadn’t ever seen anyone there besides Krom. Richter quickly used Analyze and found that the mountain dwarf’s name was Bowdin. The smith seemed to be hammering on a warhammer, of all things.

“Ah, greetings milord,” Bowdin said in a rough, but respectful, voice. He set down his hammer and picked up the cooling metal he had been working on with tongs. The hammer head went back into the furnace to heat again. The dwarf gave an order, and one of the other smiths started stoking the flames. Richter grew even more curious.

“I must confess that I am surprised to see someone other than Krom using the main anvil.”

“Ay. Krom can be tighter than a cold arsehole dipped in glue, that be for sure, har har!” The dwarf had a gruff, deep bass laugh. “He for sure do na like to share.”

Richter smiled slightly, “I won’t argue against that, but he is the village Smith. Do you have permission to use the main anvil?”

Bowdin’s eyes widened in understanding, “Did he na- Well, of course, the fool did na! The fool! Ay apologize, milord. Krom should have told ye. I am second in command of the Forge. The Smith gave me control over the anvil before he left for his Trial. After Krom, ay have the final word here. Excepting yer lordship, o’course.”

To prove his claim, Bowdin placed his hand on the anvil, and the lights inside of it came alive. Richter nodded, “Very good then, smith Bowdin. I hope you understand my caution.”

“Of course, yer Lordship,” the dwarf said, bowing his head.

“Well, what are your capabilities?”

“Ay be a level forty-four smith and have some small skill in Earth magic and Enchanting. It makes me work more durable.”

“So you’re only one level away from journeyman status then?” Richter asked.

“Ay,” Bowdin said proudly, “and as soon as ay reach the rank ay’ll be going for me Trial as well. Ay also have one more important subskill, Dense Forging. The weapons ay forge will be heavier, but they also have increased damage.”

Richter nodded. A subskill like that could definitely be useful. It seemed like it might lend itself more towards large weapons, though, like mauls or claymores. Since his favored weapon type had become small blades, he was wary to have a weapon constructed to be heavier than normal. A high attack speed was a large part of his fighting style, and a denser weapon probably meant a slower weapon. “That sounds like it could be useful, but I’m assuming that extra weight will decrease my attack speed.”

“It can indeed, yer lordship. That be only if yer Strength is no up to the task, though. Here. Look at this dagger.” The smith pulled a dagger with a ten-inch blade off of a weapons rack.



You have found:

Dense High Steel Dagger.

Damage: 13-17

Durability: 145/145

Item Class: Uncommon.

Quality: Exceptional.

Weight: 3.7 kg.

Traits: +10% damage vs. spell barriers.





Richter had learned many things about smithing in the past few weeks and was surprised by the weapon’s stats. Its weight, damage, and durability were all much higher than they should be. Krom had taught him that simple daggers had a base damage of four to six. The type of metal used to construct a weapon added to that base damage. High steel, for example, added one point to either damage or defense. It was that adjusted base damage that was affected by a smith’s skill. Each skill level someone had in Smithing gave another 1% to the durability and the damage or defense of a forged item. The last thing that affected a weapon’s damage stats was its quality. A trash quality item, for instance, decreased the final numbers by 40%, while an exceptional quality item increased damage by 30%.

Richter did some quick calculations. A high steel dagger should have a base damage of five to seven. If Bowdin was skill level forty-four, he should improve the dagger’s base damage and durability by 44%, bringing the damage up to seven to ten. With the fact that it was exceptional quality, then the damage should have been nine to thirteen. Whatever the dwarf’s Dense Forging subskill did, it had added another 40% to the weapon’s damage potential! Even better, there weren’t any requirements listed. That meant Richter’s characteristics must have been high enough that he could use the blade without any loss of speed.

“Okay, I admit it,” Richter said with admiration. “I underestimated how useful your subskill could be. How does it work?”

Bowdin beamed with pride, “Every ten levels of me subskill will add a half a point to the base damage of the blade. That be the other reason Krom left my beautiful self in charge. The only downsides be that me subskill eats metal like a whore at a sausage buffet. It also increases the base requirements of using the weapon, yer lordship. A high steel dagger requires at least six Strength and five Dexterity to use. Now any wee gal would have that, so normally, the requirement is not even something that anyone would notice. Me subskill can make the requirements a problem, though. Every extra ingot ay use can increase the requirements by 100%.” Bowdin looked appraisingly at the large frame of the village lord. “Ay be thinking that Strength not be a problem. Do ye have the Dexterity?”

Richter nodded, “I do indeed.” He swung the heavy dagger and found that he enjoyed the weight of it. He also noticed that swinging the blade made his stamina drop a bit faster than when he used lighter weapons, but the fights he had been in were normally brutal and short. Better to be able to put some serious hurt on his enemies as quickly as possible than worry about tiring out before the battle was done. Besides, that’s what stamina potions were for.

The chaos seed looked outside and gauged that he might have just enough time. He walked over the heavy elementum chest he had created weeks ago. Placing his hand on the seamless block of green metal, a line appeared where none had existed a moment before. The lid of the chest popped open. Inside were several stacks of rare metals that were set aside for his and Krom’s exclusive use. The chest also contained the skeeling scales, several pouches of powdered crystal, and surprisingly, some of the weapon fragments Richter had found in the dark aberration cave. He had completely forgotten about the broken items. Why Krom had them stored in the chest, he had no idea. It was arguably one of the most secure locations in the village. The treasury and the titan steel safe might be safer places to store valuables, but since the chest was part of a Core building, it still might win out. He picked up one of the fragments, a hilt, but no prompt appeared. As far as he could tell, the junk was, well, just junk.

Richter put the hilt back down and picked up an ingot. Part of him wanted to use one of his elementum ingots, but there were only a few of them left. He had to be deliberate about utilizing the precious metal. He was also pretty sure Krom would be worse than a jilted girlfriend if he forged elementum with another dwarf. Best just to leave it be.

Instead, he chose moonstone. The creamy white metal would give +4 to base attack damage, and they had a relatively large amount of it after finding a small vein south of the village. Closing the chest, he walked back over to Bowdin. “We have some work to do.”

At Bowdin’s command, two other smiths started feeding wood into the furnace from a waiting stack. To be able to work stronger metals, the fire had to be stoked to a higher heat. That, in turn, required specific types of wood to coax the flames to that point. It was times like these that Richter realized how fortunate he was to have a village that could support him. Between the high cost of precious metals, the need for rare woods, the specialized labor required to make a decent weapon, not to mention needing to know enchantments and having access to soul stones, making strong magic weapons was a ridiculously involved process. It also explained why a weapon that was even minimally enchanted might cost an average worker a year’s salary.

Richter didn’t think too much about it, though. There was work to be done. To his surprise, Bowdin asked for two more ingots. Richter retrieved them from the chest, and they got started. The smith told him that he was in luck. Apparently, Bowdin had already started working on a moonstone blade, so much of the work had already been done. It normally took days to make a weapon, and trying to shortchange that time would invariably lead to a loss in quality. The dwarf said they should be able to finish it in the next few hours.

Once the heat from the furnace had reached almost oppressive levels, Bowdin placed the moonstone ingot into the fire. After a minute or two, it glowed cherry red, and the dwarf placed it on the anvil. Soon, the sounds of metal being hammered filled the air. Clang! Cling cling. Clang! Cling cling.

The chaos seed decided not to waste the opportunity and downed a luck potion. There were still many enchantments housed in the main anvil, represented by the dancing lights inside of it. Learning the enchantments seemed to be a matter of luck mixed with man hours spent on the anvil. So far Richter had only been able to learn Freeze, Life Damage, Goblin Slaying and Confusion from helping Krom at the anvil. That left many enchantments left to learn. As always when he drank one of the luck potions, he hiccupped slightly, exhaling a swirl of silvery powder. He had asked Tabia if that was an expected side effect, but she had just stared at him for a moment and then said, “Of course!” Richter was 80% convinced she had been lying out of her ass and had no idea.

Over the next twenty minutes, Bowdin pounded the first ingot into submission. Then he placed the second ingot in the fire. After that, he alternated heating one and hammering on the other. After another fifteen minutes of that, he combined the two into one large piece of molten metal. Richter was confused as to how this was going to help anything, but he kept his peace and followed the smith’s directions to add the next ingot to the fire.

The frequency and strength of the dwarf’s hammer blows increased. Clang! Clang! Cling. Clang! Clang! Cling. To Richter’s surprise, Bowdin’s hammer and the hand that held it began to glow. The large, misshapen lump of hot metal began to shrink. Before it got too small, Bowdin called for the next ingot. Richter retrieved it from the forge and placed the red-white block on the anvil. Once again, Bowdin started pounding the ingot into submission while his already existing work went into the forge. Soon he combined them, and again, his arm and hammer started to glow. His blows grew even stronger, and sweat poured off of his biceps. The portions of his face not covered in beard were ruddy with heat and strain. CLANG! Clang! Clink! CLANG! Clang! Clink!

The process repeated a final time. The half-finished blade Bowdin had been working on was placed in the furnace until it glowed. The last measure of metal was added to the dwarf’s work. Bowdin hammered at his creation like a man possessed. CLANG, CLANG, CLANG! CLANG, CLANG, CLANG! Richter grew legitimately concerned that the smith would pass out. Analyze showed that the hour of work had decreased the dwarf’s stamina until only 10% remained. The look of concentration on Bowdin’s face kept the chaos seed from interfering, though. No one liked a back seat driver. Side seat smither… whatever.

With a final swing of the hammer, the glow infusing Bowdin’s arm and hammer winked out. The smith laid down his hammer and grabbed a pair of tongs. He plunged the blade into a nearby bucket of water and laid the finished product on the anvil. Then, with a self-satisfied and exhausted exhale, Bowdin stepped back and allowed Richter to examine his new blade. The chaos seed was about to, but his luck paid off again when a white light shot from the inside of the anvil and enveloped the blade. The light was blinding, and both men had to close their eyes against the glare. They didn’t mind, though because they knew what it meant. Large grins got plastered onto their faces. One of the Forge of Heaven’s abilities had activated! The weapon had just jumped up a level in quality!

The dwarf had done well! Like all weapons created in the Forge of Heavens, a small mark appeared on one side of the sword’s base, proving its provenance. The blade wasn’t as good as his elementum short swords, but with +1.95 damage added to its base damage, this blade could cause some serious pain. It was definitely heavy, but his Strength was up to the challenge. Bowdin told him the base requirements for a short sword were seven Strength and four Dexterity. That meant this bad boy could only be used by someone with twenty-eight Str and sixteen Dex! At least Richter wouldn’t have to worry about too many people using the blade against him; few had the stats to even wield it. Richter marveled that the blade was not bulky. Bowdin’s Dense Forging subskill seemed accurately named. The weapon was no larger or thicker than any other short sword; it just weighed a great deal more. Richter was impressed. Still, always better to keep your workers on their toes, the chaos seed thought to himself.

“Kinda heavy,” he said in mock criticism.

Bowdin was quick to defend his work, “Ay, yer lordship. Adding all that metal increases the weight, but ay promise ye, it be worth it. The blade would be even heavier, but me apprentice rank in Dense Forging decreases the weight that each ingot adds by 20%.”

“Speaking of that, you didn’t exactly let me know that it would take four times as many ingots to make the blade!” Richter said primly.

Bowdin had the good grace to look somewhat abashed, “Well, ye see yer lordship. Ay knew the large cost in metals might turn ye away, but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to show ye what ay could do. The truth is that each ten levels of me subskill requires another ingot to be used up. It be the extra metal that increases the attack and adds the weight. Ay be sure ye agree now, though, it was worth the ingots.”

Richter gave a short, barking laugh. No matter what world you were in, people would bend the rules if it meant getting a leg up. He didn’t really blame the man, and Bowdin might not get another opportunity to show off when Krom got back. Also, the dwarf was right, the blade truly did have some stopping power. The high metal cost meant that he couldn’t use the technique with his more expensive metals, but it might be a great way to upgrade the gear for his guards.

“You did well,” Richter said. “Now give me a minute, it’s time for my part.”

He reached into his bag and removed a pouch of powdered crystal. Taking a handful, he sprinkled a measure of the precious resource on the newly forged blade. He had learned over the past weeks that there were only seven minutes from the creation of a piece of arms or armor to enchant it. Doing so any later triggered serious penalties for any enchantment that was tied to the item. Using the crystal started a new timer.

Richter read through the prompt, his choice already made, but then he paused. Beast Slaying? He hadn’t unlocked that enchantment yet. Then he realized that he had been so intent on watching Bowdin work that he had missed the fact that his notification icon was winking in the corner of his vision. The last notification from the earlier battle was still waiting for him, the memory from the goblin Witch Doctor, but now there were a few more. Richter accessed the notifications and got another great surprise. His luck had no end!

Congratulations! You have learned the subskill: Dense Forging. From watching Smith Bowdin closely, you have learned the secrets of his subskill. You will now be able to combine ingots of the same type to increase the durability and base stats of forged items. The weight and requirements of forged items will increase based upon the mass of metal used.

Congratulations! You have learned the enchantment: Beast Slaying. Weapons instilled with this enchantment will do extra damage to beasts.

He had gained another subskill! It might not be the type of subskill he could practice a lot, but still, it didn’t hurt! Despite the stresses of the day and the difficult conversations that were waiting for him, a smile creased his face. It felt good to be moving forward. Richter turned his attention back to the blade awaiting his enchantment.

The cost of Goblin Slaying increases by 1.5n. You can reach the 8th rank of this enchantment by expending 44 soul points. Final Yield from maximizing Goblin Slaying would be +78% damage to goblins (base 48% increased damage + 48% for enchanting skill + 5% for Increase Enchantment Strength I + 10% for Increase Weapon Enchant Strength I). Do you wish to power this enchantment? Yes or No?

The enchantment could make his new blade into a truly powerful weapon! The only question was, how many higher level stones was he willing to use? He had plenty of common souls, but they only gave ten points each. His Talent Increase Soul Stone Yield I, increased the soul points of each by 25%, but seeing as how he could only use three stones per enchantment, he would still only have thirty-seven and a half points. To maximize his enchantment, he would have to use a luminous stone as well. Sighing heavily over the cost of doing business, he took two common and one luminous stone out of his bag. He made his peace with it by remembering that the lugash had yielded luminous souls. Accessing the power within the glowing amber jewels, three small ribbons of rainbow light came out of their pulsing hearts and flowed around the white metal. The soul stones crumpled to dust. A now familiar pressure built in the air.

The ribbons of light surrounding the moonstone blade swelled in power. The soul stuff released did not automatically flow into the blade. It took the will of the enchanter to force the power into the item awaiting enchantment. Each rank of enchantment was harder to coax into an item. A palpable tension built into the air as the item’s resistance to the swirling soul stuff built exponentially as each successive rank of enchantment was reached.

After enchanting for weeks, Richter could almost call out as the enchantment reached a new rank. The first rank created a pressure in the air that felt like a storm that might break in the next few hours. It was barely noticeable. Rank four was like being in an airplane that quickly changed in elevation. After that, the changes grew more pronounced. Rank six was like free diving down to thirty feet. Rank eight, the highest rank Richter had reached so far, felt like your head was being slowly squeezed in a vice. Thankfully each rank only lasted a few seconds, so any actual discomfort was minimal and fleeting.

Despite the short amount of time it took for an enchantment to take effect, to Richter it felt like ages. He could not help but think about the fact that increasing the ranks of an enchantment increased the chance of the enchantment not taking hold. While the loss of the soul stones without any tangible yield would suck, he also dwelled on what Gloran had told him. Every once in a while, the magic released from soul stones could cause unexpected effects if the enchantment failed. The soul power released from the gems needed to find an outlet. If it didn’t enter the blade, it would go elsewhere. The energy might bleed harmlessly away into the ether… or it might blow shit up.

Richter knew from personal experience that failing to complete an enchantment once started could have dangerously explosive consequences. Krom hadn’t talked to Richter for a whole day after the chaos seed’s attention had slipped while they were working together. He still thought the dwarf had been overreacting. While it was true the axe head they’d been working on had exploded, only a small portion of the dwarf’s beard had been singed off. Still, the flesh wounds they had received had been enough to make Richter a bit gun shy every time he attempted a strong enchantment these days.

This time, his luck held. Richter smiled to himself and thought about how no one appreciated his genius. He felt the intangible pop that occurred when the last of the soul stuff overcame the blade’s resistance to being enchanted. The power had found a home!

Richter smiled at his new blade. The only way it could have turned out better is if a heavenly ability of the forge had activated. That only occurred in conjunction with certain celestial convergences though. Though as of yet, they couldn’t be predicted, once the village’s current research was done, he could expect more weapons made in the forge to have an extra trait. Thinking about what that might mean for his enemies brought a warm, fuzzy feeling to his heart.

Bowdin congratulated him on a successful enchantment. He promised that he would set the blade and have it ready for the morning. He also told Richter that a type of water lizard had recently been discovered and slain by the hunters. With a smile on his face, the smith promised that the leather used for the hilt would never slip from his grasp or grow slick. Richter clapped the man on the back and thanked him for his hard work. Then, he remembered what his next duty was. With a grim set to his face, he left the forge and marched towards the northern meadow. Terrod was waiting for him at the top of the hill.

“My lord,” the captain greeted him solemnly.

“Terrod,” Richter replied, stopping. He searched the man’s face. Despite that fact that he and Terrod were Companions, his relationship with the innkeeper-turned-guard was very different from his relationship with Sion. Now that he was thinking of it, he realized that his relationship with Elora was different as well. They were all his Companions, but while Sion was a brother, and the pixie queen was half-little sister and half-vassal, Terrod was like a well-trusted employee. Someone who had been through hard times with him. It had bred respect, trust and a calm friendship. “I’m glad you came,” Richter finished.

“How could I not? They were my men,” Terrod said with a trace of bitterness.

Richter took the man’s tone hard. With a slight crack in his voice, he said, “I promise that I did everything I could to save them.”

Terrod’s face took on a look of surprise, “My lord…” He stepped closer and looked the chaos seed in the eye. “Richter. I do not blame you for the deaths of my men. Gregane, Nitol and Amara all believed in what we are creating here. A home for our families and a place where we can all coexist. Where they could become whatever they wanted, no matter their race. Just seeing dwarves, elves, sprites and humans working together every day is amazing. No, my lord, I do not blame you. After I have had a few hours to digest the news, I do not even blame myself. Respost tine.”

Congratulations! You have learned a new language: Old Common.

“Look to yourself?” Richter asked, translating.

“Your ability to do that always astounds me,” Terrod said, shaking his head. “The phrase is in old common. I didn’t know it translated exactly to that phrase. It’s something all soldiers learn to say. Not before a battle, but upon coming home. It is spoken to remind us of an immutable truth that all fighting men and women learn. After every successful battle, we would say repost tine to remember that, in The Land, ‘Death comes swiftly.’ I don’t blame you, my lord, but we need to prepare better. Our guards need more potions and better weapons. Most importantly however, they need better training. I must formally request that the next building erected be a barracks.”

You have received a Quest: Battle Prep I. The Captain of the Guard, Terrod, is requesting for you to have a barracks built. Yes or No? Reward: Settlement bonus from building a barracks. Penalty for Failure: Decreased relationship with the village guards.

Richter easily accepted the quest, “I think you’re right. We have been building up the village’s infrastructure, but it means nothing if we can’t defend ourselves. Roswan will be gone until he returns from his Trial, but that is the very next thing on the agenda.”

“Thank you, my lord,” Terrod said with a bow of his head. When he straightened, he turned his gaze towards the Quickening and the families that waited there.

Richter sighed and said, “Now let's go thank the loved ones of the men and women that died for us today.”

With heavy hearts, but straight backs, the two men went to share sorrow and remember the dead.





CHAPTER 11 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG





The conversation was painful, but went better than Richter had hoped. The only negative response was from Amara’s husband. He wept bitterly when he heard of his wife’s death. He cursed Richter and stormed off. Isabella, who was standing nearby, told Richter that she would handle it. Whether she would or not, Richter still received a prompt.

Due to the death of his wife Amara, you lost 15,342 Relationship Points with Rino. Total Relationship Points: -586

Your relationship with Rino has decreased from Admiring to Unfriendly.

The loss of Relationship points was massive, but Richter didn’t blame the man. In all honesty, the only surprise was that their relationship hadn’t dropped all the way to hatred. A cynical part of himself that he despised, but still embraced, made a mental note to keep an eye on the grieving widower from here on out. Even if the man’s sorrow was justified, he could still be a danger. Making eye contact with Randolphus, an unspoken communication passed between them, and Richter knew they were on the same page.

No, Rino’s response was not a surprise. The reaction he obtained from Nitol’s wife, Fopana, was a bit of a shock however. Tears were already running down the woman’s face before Richter broke the bad news. She had easily deduced why she was there after hearing what Richter told Rino. Fopana said afterwards that she had already suspected her husband was gone, because he always made a point to come see her after returning from a hunt. With her cheeks wet and eyes red, she simply asked, “Did he die well?”

Richter took her hand, “He died saving lives and protecting this village. He didn’t suffer.”

She asked one more question, straight and to the point, “What will become of me and my baby?”

Still holding her hand, he said, “You and your child will always have a place here. You will receive the entire year’s salary that Nitol would have earned, and if you wish to leave I will help. I hope that you will stay with us though. I swear that I will do my best by you and your family so long as I am lord here.”

She wiped the tears from her face, and then straightened to her full five feet and five inches of height, “I will stay here, if you promise me one thing. Spill the blood of those who are responsible for my husband’s death.”

Slightly taken aback, Richter still looked her directly in the eye and said, “I have killed the ones who killed your husband, and, very soon, I will kill the ones who sent them.”

She nodded firmly, “Then I am with you, my lord.”

Due to avenging the death of her husband Nitol, and agreeing to bring vengeance upon those who sent his killers, you have gained 1,638 Relationship Points with Fopana. Total Relationship Points: 25,032.

Your relationship with Fopana has increased from Admiring to Trusting.

Richter was at a loss for words. He had never expected to find such strength in a grieving widow and he doubted he could have borne similar news with such grace. The rest of the villagers were gathering though, led by Randolphus, so their shared moment of sorrow and vengeance came to an end. He dropped Fopana’s hand and the two of them walked over to the monument.

Most of the villagers had heard that there had been deaths on the hunt, but they did not know who. More tears fell as Richter spoke a few words. He then placed a hand on the enchanted stone and three more names carved themselves onto the wall of remembrance. Several villagers spoke up, sharing stories of the dead. Pixie children flew through the air above the villagers and filled the night with a soft and sad ode to the dead.

Randolphus had arranged for a grave to be dug. After everyone that wanted to speak had had their say, the bodies were lowered one by one as Sumiko’s biomancers cast the spell, Final Rest. A golden glow surrounded each shrouded corpse and ensured that they would never rise again as undead.

Mist workers filled in the graves. A light rain began to fall and the villagers started to disperse. A rumble in Richter’s stomach reminded him that he hadn’t eaten. Absently, the chaos seed pulled some hard tack from his bag and ate it while he walked over to stand next to Hisako.

“Thank you for healing my men earlier,” he said.

“Of course,” she said. “I was able to restore both men completely.”

“You were able to fix the eye?” he asked in disbelief.

She smiled faintly, “I am a Life Master, in case you have forgotten.”

Richter smiled broadly and without reservation for the first time since the battle, “Thank you. I am truly blessed to have such an ally.”

She reached up and lightly slapped his cheek, “Do not forget it, young Master.” The playful look fell from her face, “We have much to discuss.”

The chaos seed nodded, “Not here. Come to the catacombs. I can feel my familiar flying closer. She has information that we will need.”

The Hearth Mother nodded and started walking back down to the village. Yoshi followed her, silent as a shadow. Randolphus got everyone else moving. Richter walked up to the freshly turned grave and stood silent vigil as the drizzle continued to fall. A few minutes later, he started walking back towards the village.

Richter took a slight detour to the Dragon’s Cauldron. Finding it empty for once, he restocked some of his potions. He was going to leave, but the sound of the rain soothed him. He closed his eyes, and, for a few minutes, he found peace in hearing the rain fall upon the glass roof. He had always loved the rain. Time passed and his spirit eased. His mind floated to happy and easy times, and, briefly, his cares were washed away.

The chaos seed couldn’t ignore the demands of life for long though. The blinking of a notification icon brought him back to the present. There was information he needed before meeting with Hisako and the others, and there was only one way to get it.

The prompt he was looking at had a clear border that pulsed with light. Richter had been putting off reliving the Witch Doctor’s memory. The remembrances that Alma stole while using Brain Drain could be disturbing, if not outright dangerous. He had also barely had a free moment since the battle that had claimed the Mage’s life. Richter couldn’t put it off any longer, though. If he was going to help with the war council to the best of his ability, the time was now.

Congratulations! You have captured a memory from a Goblin Witch Doctor. This memory can only be accessed for the next eleven hours and twelve minutes before dissolution into the ether. Experiencing this memory will be instantaneous in regards to your timeline. Do you wish to access this memory? Yes or No?

He mentally selected “Yes” and his world swirled down through a pinprick of memory.





CHAPTER 12 – Retained Memory





Once again Richter experienced life through the memories and senses of another. He, or rather the Witch Doctor, was walking through the goblin encampment. The goblin was lamenting having been summoned by the camp commander, may his member get pox and rot off. It was immensely unfair that he, a level thirty-five Mage, would have to come to this damned forest in the first place. Back in the swamps, he had wives and slaves that catered to his every whim.

His newest slave, a young elf girl, had just been broken! True, he had had to feed one of her sons to the lonelath maggots, but that was just foreplay! Sin-ak had yet to meet a slave that wouldn’t break when faced with the days-long death caused by foot-long maggots burrowing through their body… or the body of their remaining son. The goblin snorted in disgust; he had only been able to enjoy her sobbing body once, before he had left home. It was infuriating!

A scout was unlucky enough to cross his path as he stalked towards the Bloodstone. Goblin society operated by a severe caste system called “stations.” Near the bottom were the scouts. Even though goblins of the scout station possessed a meager intellect, most of them had learned to stay out of his way. As a rikker, the Witch Doctor was so high above them in goblin society that no one would fault him for taking his ire out on the smaller goblins. This was something that he took advantage of as often as possible.

Sin-ak began an incantation, conjuring the spell form into his mind. At the same time, his left hand formed the arcane gesture for the magic. With a gleefully brutal twist to his lips, the Mage finished his spell. Black energy had been building on his hand over the three second casting. It had been just enough time for the scout to see that he was being targeted. The small goblin tried to run, but got nowhere near the outer range of Sin-ak’s spell, Minor Festering Boils.

The scout’s skin began to bubble and pop. Each boil that rose and burst took away one to two health, and there were dozens of boils. Sin-ak’s adept rank in Dark magic increased his spell strength by 35%. Coupled with his high Intelligence attribute, the goblin scout never had a chance.

Richter tried to stop Sin-ak, horrified by the image of what the spell would do to the goblin scout. He had no love for goblins, that was to be sure, but through the Witch Doctor, Richter understood that the spell was meant to torture while it killed. As with his last jaunt through memory, however, the chaos seed was only a passenger.

The scout continued to scream until the boils began to form on the inside of her throat. The sounds coming from the goblin woman changed into a sickeningly wet burbling. The Witch Doctor’s necklace began to vibrate as the enslaved souls within detected the sweet scent of imminent death. Sin-ak stroked the necklace lovingly. As horrible a death as the Mage had just inflicted on the scout, it was a kindness compared to the spiritual torments he had subjected his enslaved souls to. Each had been brutalized and violated until the personalities they had once possessed had become so warped that no goodness remained.

Feeling like an indulgent father, Si-nak opened the cage doors that kept the spirits bound within his necklace. None of them could stray far from the necklace. Neither could they harm the wearer, so the Witch Doctor had nothing to fear. The tortured goblin had no such protections. All three malevolent spirits began to claw and scratch at the scout, hastening its end. Only a few seconds later, she shuddered a final time and died. It was only then that the scout knew true horror. No longer bound by flesh, the goblin’s soul began to depart from the mortal plane, but it never made it.

The Witch Doctor’s spirits began to feast. The goblin’s soul was torn apart as it screamed silently. Each enslaved spirit grabbed chunks of soul stuff and shoved it into their greedy maws. The soul tried to escape, but its struggles were useless. The scout’s soul was not the first that had been sacrificed to feed and grow the Witch Doctor’s slave spirits. Soon, all that was left of the once-living creature was a pockmarked carcass. Nothing remained of her soul.

The glutted spirits returned happily back to their cages. Once they were back in the necklace, Sin-ak in turn grew stronger, his mana, health and stamina boosted by the consumed soul his enslaved creatures had brought back to him. Now in a much better mood, the Mage stepped over the scout’s body, not sparing it another thought. Other scouts ran up behind him and began rifling through the dead goblin’s clothes.

Sin-ak continued walking through the camp. He liked to stop by the prisoner pens and mock the soon-to-be sacrificial victims, but couldn’t take the time today. The commander was not known for his patience. As much as the Witch Doctor hated his superior, he wouldn’t risk his wrath. The Mage made his way through the camp, all giving way before him until he reached the commander’s tent. Unlike the other goblins in the encampment, the elite guards standing outside of the tent were not cowed by either the Witch Doctor’s magic or his rikker station.

The guards just stared at him until Sin-ak snapped, “Move, fools. Your master has asked for my counsel!”

The well-armored duo just kept staring at him. Though Sin-ak was tall for a goblin, they still overtopped him by three to four inches. It stirred a deep anger inside of him, but the Mage did not push further. Even he understood that Specialists of the ortai station were not to be trifled with. After staring at him for another few seconds, the guard on the right turned away and poked his head into the tent. The guard spoke quietly, but the response was anything but subtle.

“Tell him to get his sprite-fucking ass in here!” thundered a deep bass from inside.

The guards stepped aside and Sin-ak passed through the tent flaps. Richter got his first view of the goblin commander.

Most goblins were between four and five feet tall, so far as Richter had seen. Higher ranked “stations” were normally taller. Scouts were the smallest the chaos seed had seen; fighters were a few inches taller; and the Warriors he had killed earlier in the day were a touch over five feet tall. Analyze had shown him that they belonged to the grinder station.

The Witch Doctor whose memory he was witnessing now had been part of the rikker station. Though a touch shorter than the grinder Warriors, the Mage had been in charge. Analyze had shown him that the rikker station was known for having magical powers and seemed to be middle management in the goblin hierarchy. The goblin commander was something else entirely.

The commander stood just shy of six feet tall and was powerfully built. Most of the goblins he had seen were either a dark green or a sickly lighter green. The one notable exception had been Big Red, the goblin Richter had killed to gain control of the Mist Village. This goblin’s color was a mix of red and black, like a lightly glowing coal. The commander’s muscle structure was different as well. Goblins could definitely be strong, but their arms and legs had muscles like a frog: wiry and built for snap movements. The commander defied Richter’s expectations in this as well.

The bastard was built like a brick house. He stood bare-chested, with large pecs and every muscle on his torso standing out in sharp definition. The commander looked like a bodybuilder, but Richter knew that the goblin’s physique was not just for show. The myriad scars crisscrossing his body were proof of that. Tattoos covered his body as well. Richter cursed the fact that he couldn’t use Analyze to find out more about the goblins’ leader, but this was just a memory.

“Took your time getting here!” the commander said scathingly. A hooded figure stood in a shadowed corner of the tent, and two pleasure slaves cowered upon the leader’s bed. The Witch Doctor gazed hatefully at the commander’s pet caster for a moment, but then turned his attention back to the goblin glaring death at him.

“I came as soon as I received your message, Heqht-jo,” Sin-ak replied, with barely concealed hate. That was how Richter learned the name of his enemy.

“Then you are slow like an old woman!” Heqht-jo responded. He took a step forward, his hand brushing the head of an axe hanging at his belt. The commander glared at Sin-ak. This time, the Witch Doctor held his tongue. After a few seconds, Heqht-jo leered, enjoying the power he had over the Mage and stepped back. “I summoned you because one of the hill rats escaped. You will take a squad and bring him back, dead or alive.”

“Send the mercenaries,” Sin-ak snapped. “I am here to feed the Bloodstone and get through the protective barrier. It is not my job to hunt down sprite vermin!” The idea that he would have to stoop to hunting a single puny escapee, even if it was one of their racial enemies, was insulting. If the commander only knew how dangerous it was to be around a Bloodstone, let alone what is was like to touch and feed one… Suffice it to say that while being entrusted with such a powerful relic was an honor, it was an honor the Witch Doctor could do without. Sin-ak was sure the larger goblin would be licking his feet, if only the commander’s small mind could comprehend even a tenth of how valuable his contribution was! It appeared, however, that the two of them had a difference of opinion.

“Your job is whatever I say!” Heqht-jo roared. Spittle flew from his jaws. This time the hand axe did not stay on his belt but instead found a new home in the commander’s hand. His eyes widened and the weapon shook in his grasp, so great was his anger. Sin-ak saw the camp leader’s eyes redden for a moment.

The Mage stood completely still, unwilling to push further. It was not just Heqht-jo’s personal power that kept him firmly in command of the goblin encampment. It was also his horrible temper. While Sin-ak might enjoy torturing a scout or fighter every once in a while, the commander was an animal. It was not unheard of for Heqht-jo to rip the arms or legs off of those who would oppose him. If he lost himself to rage, the commander was normally only soothed by literally bathing in his enemy’s blood. The problem was, no one ever knew how much would be required. Suffice it to say, the goblins that served under him never wished to find out.

Sin-ak bowed his head, though it brought bile to his throat. As powerful as he was, he couldn’t best the commander in close quarters combat and they both knew it. Richter held his proverbial breath. He knew that Sin-ak had survived this encounter, otherwise Richter would never have been able to fight him later, but reliving the Witch Doctor’s memory meant reliving the fear the Mage had experienced as well. Luckily, the commander was appeased by the show of deference.

Only a foot separated them, and when the commander spoke again, Sin-ak could smell Heqht-jo’s fetid breath, “You will take a squad to find the hill sprite. You will claim his body, living or dead. If he goes into the abyss, you will go after him and bring him back.” Heqht-jo placed the blade of his axe under the Mage’s chin and applied pressure until the Witch Doctor had to tilt his head back and look him in the face. His voice was measured and intense. It was frightening when contrasted with the wild anger in his eyes.

“I will not allow escaped vermin to threaten my mission. The clan has tasked me with recovering the item, and I will do that. We cannot allow the sprite to alert his kinsmen that we are here. Come back with the sprite, or I will bathe in your blood. Do you understand?” The commander’s voice had gone deadly quiet. It was somehow more frightening than when he was screaming. Sin-ak’s mouth went dry.

“I understand, commander.” He licked his lips, “I would like to request some Professionals accompany me. This area is wild and the monsters can be dangerous.”

“Ha!” Heqht-jo sneered at the caster. “You may have two Warriors. I will not commit all of our resources to what should be a simple task. Prove your worth or die trying. If you fail in this, no members of the tribe will object to your death… no matter who your father is.”

That was the core of Heqht-jo’s dislike of the Witch Doctor. Sin-ak’s father was part of the ruling council for the powerful Black Death tribe, one of the most powerful tribes in the clan. The commander never wasted an opportunity to make the point that Sin-ak had only progressed in the tribe due to nepotism. Warranted or not, the accusations had created a deep rift, filled with hate, between the two goblins.

“Now go!” Heqht-jo said dismissively. He turned away and walked back to his pleasure slaves as if Sin-ak was already forgotten.

Something inside of the Witch Doctor just couldn’t resist responding. “Have you had any luck penetrating the shield around the artifact? You are correct about one thing. The tribal leaders will be most displeased if you fail to obtain an object of such power.”

Heqht-jo stopped walking, but did not turn around. The Witch Doctor could see the powerful muscles in the commander’s back tighten. When the goblin leader spoke, the hatred in his voice was palpable, “Focus on sacrificing the prisoners to the Bloodstone. If your magic was good for anything more than shade on a sunny day, you could have filled the stone and we would be gone from this place!” Heqht-jo turned his head and made eye contact with his subordinate, “I will make you a promise. Any ill fate that befalls me due to this mission’s failure will find you as well. I swear it. I swear it. I swear it.”

The petty satisfaction Sin-ak had felt for a moment dried up like a slug in the sun when he heard Heqht-jo make his oath three times. A subtle vibration emanated out from where they stood, the Universe taking witness of the pledge. He met the commander’s gaze for another second, but ultimately it was he who turned away. Heqht-jo kept walking and the pleasure slaves began to cry and plead as they saw the deadly expression on the powerfully-built goblin’s face. Sin-ak didn’t blame them. He had an idea of the torments they would experience for the rest of their short and tragic lives.

The first cries of pain began as the Witch Doctor left the tent. The memory began to fade and Richter knew that the Mage’s last thought was that the escaped hill sprite would die slowly. As the goblin’s mind filled with horrid perversions of how he would violate and torture his quarry, Richter was glad that he had ended the life of such an evil creature.





CHAPTER 13 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




Richter came back to himself. He blinked quickly as he got used to having only one set of thoughts in his head again. The chaos seed was somewhat shaken by the casual anger and violence that had existed in the Witch Doctor’s thoughts. Richter knew that since coming to The Land, he had done things that might be called morally ambiguous, but the pure joy the Mage had felt in wanton cruelty was something that he had never before experienced. After living through the memory, he felt much more comfortable with the fact that he had slaughtered dozens of goblins in the past. Richter just wasn’t sure if that was a good or a bad thing.

The chaos seed got himself together and left the Dragon’s Cauldron. Though he had lived through nearly an hour of the Witch Doctor’s memory, only a moment had passed in the village. The rain still fell at the same steady tattoo. Richter walked through the light shower towards the catacombs and the war council. There was a bit of a chill in the air, and Richter could smell fires burning in the chimneys of the longhouses. As he walked, he summoned a mist light. Once he reached the hill that led down to the village, he looked out over his settlement and smiled. Mist lights floated in the air all across the land, providing a soft, fey light. His reverie was interrupted by the flap of small wings. A moment later, a weight settled onto his shoulder.

*Welcome back, my love,* he thought affectionately.

Alma nuzzled her small face against his cheek and wrapped her tail around his arm for support. She flapped her wings quickly to shed the water sending cold water down his back. The chaos seed grunted in protest, but couldn’t stay mad at her when she settled down onto his shoulders. Then she started sending him images. Richter continued walking towards the catacombs that led down to the village proper. The rain began to fall a bit harder, and his cloak grew heavier. His steps grew heavier with both water and responsibility while Alma showed him things that he did not want to see.

When Richter entered the conference room where everyone waited, his face was grim. He communicated what he had learned with a simple message, “We’ve got problems.”

Alma had done her job well. As promised, she had stayed high in the sky and had gone unseen by the goblins she had spied upon. The images she sent him automatically updated his Traveler’s Map and, in turn, Bea updated the information in the Knowledge Table. After that, the Scholar left. The only people remaining in the room were Hisako, Yoshi, Liddle, Terrod, Caulder, Randolphus, Sion, and Richter. As they poured over the large aerial view map, one thing became clear. There were a lot more than a hundred goblins.

“I swear, Lord Richter, I had no idea there were so many!” Liddle was almost babbling. No one blamed him.

“It is hard to say from these pictures,” Yoshi said, “but I believe we may be looking at a force of three to five hundred goblins. The fortifications are not complete, but there are still enough of them to cause us serious problems. There also seem to only be two entrances to this valley, and they have placed contingents at the only one we have access to. Attacking it will notify the main force.”

The sword adept’s assessment seemed accurate. The western end of the valley narrowed to a small pass, no more than thirty yards across. To either side of the western entrance were sheer rock walls hundreds of feet high. The other entrance was near the eastern end of the valley and set into the northern cliff face. It was only a cave in the rock face. Alma had only seen the side that emptied into the valley. It was the mouth of a tunnel that went under the mountain. Whether it let out in a hundred feet or in thirty miles, they didn’t know. The dragonling had flown above, but couldn’t find the other entrance.

The entire valley was about nine miles long and two miles wide. Mountains rose high enough along both sides that snowcapped the tops in places, despite it being summer. The goblin encampment was built on a slight rise smack dab in the middle. A waterfall fell from a cliff face along to the eastern side of the valley and fed a river stream that traced down the valley’s length before disappearing underground near the western approach. Copses of trees dotted the valley floor, but for the most part, it was hilly grassland.

The encampment was much larger than Liddle had said, though it was clear why the hill sprite had been wrong. Alma had spied the cages where the captives were being kept. They were screened off from the rest of the encampment and were almost next to the wall surrounding the encampment. There would be no way that someone kept there would have known about all of the tents and campfires that comprised the rest of the settlement. A wooden palisade, ten feet high, surrounded about 60% of the camp. A second wall, twenty feet high, surrounded an inner encampment and was complete.

Richter had had Bea upload several still shots from the hour that Alma had observed the goblins. That was why there was such discrepancy in the count of the goblins. Looking at each still from different angles, it was difficult to tell if a goblin was counted twice or if there were still more inside of the tents. Still, one thing was clear. There were a fuckload of them.

The encampment had been built around a cave that led down into the hill it was perched on. From the elevation Alma had been flying at, nothing more could be seen other than a large boulder with a black hole on one side. A large pit was not far from the cave. Richter had no idea how deep it was, but it was filled with at least a hundred bodies. Several members of the war council cursed as they saw it.

Several yards to the side of the abattoir was a large red stone. Its surface was irregular, like an uncut jewel, and it was about the size of a large bowling ball. The ruby jewel sat upon an iron dais. Large splashes of blood were on the ground surrounding the dais. If a series of cows had exploded, Richter thought, this is what it would have looked like. There was no doubt that this was the Bloodstone.

Yoshi wanted to examine the fortifications more, but Hisako overruled him. Richter gave her a quick tutorial on how to zoom in and out and how to move the map. Despite it being a Knowledge Table and not a fully interactive Cartographer’s Table, the detail was still astounding. It was limited only by the acuity of Alma’s vision, which turned out to be as sharp as an eagle’s. Zooming in far enough, individual insects could be seen hovering in the air. The Hearth Mother zoomed in on the red sphere and sucked her teeth.

“I cannot guarantee this is true, but I believe the stone is half full,” she said.

Richter had been standing by the table summoning mist lights. It had become a habit to use his mana pool to summon mist lights and workers for others to use. The lights were an especially good use of his time, as each light lasted for a full year. They did not emit a strong light, but they could be hung in midair. The village was already much more well-lit at night.

He finished summoning a mist worker and ordered it to corral the lights to the feast area where his villagers could distribute them. Once it had moved out of the way, he leaned in to look closer at the Bloodstone. At first, he had no idea what she had seen, but then he saw it too. At first, he had thought the red sphere was a uniform dark red. Now, though, he could see that the bottom half was an even darker red. It looked like a hollow red globe that had been half filled with red wine. In his heart, he knew what it was filled with, though.

“What does that mean?” Richter asked the Hearth Mother. “How can it only be half full? There are more than a hundred people in the pit. There are children in there! There is a baby in there!”

She looked him firmly in the eye, “Now you see the voracious appetite of the Bloodstone. You ask what this means? It means that we attack tomorrow.”

Liddle cheered slightly, but Richter was surprised, “Tomorrow? Is that enough time to plan? I feel strange being the one saying this, but isn’t there an argument for caution here? I just lost three of my people, and I’m not eager to send more against a fortified compound without a firm plan.”

Hisako listened to him without interrupting, but shook her head, “I am glad to see that you are learning caution and that you value the lives of your people. This, however, cannot wait. You may have looked upon the walls and thought that we would still have days or weeks before they finished their defenses. You are looking at the wrong thing. That wall is nothing. The Bloodstone is the real threat. According to Liddle, they have only been sacrificing one person per day. That tells us something vital. There is no Blood mage in the encampment. If there were, the stone could absorb magic from as many as were sacrificed. All at once.”

“From your tone, I get that that would be bad,” Richter said. His tone was lightly mocking to hide his concern, “What is the Bloodstone, though? Why does it matter?”

The Hearth Mother sighed, “I am not an expert. I will also admit that I have never seen one. Most of my information comes from old tomes and stories, but my mother told me of a great battle that occurred before I was born. A trio of sanguimancers wielded Bloodstones and laid waste to entire armies. The Kingdom of Yves was almost brought to its knees. Several duchies were destroyed utterly. I do not know exactly what the capabilities of this Bloodstone are. Some say the powers vary for each stone. Most agree that they come from a time before the banished gods. What is known, and not disputed, is that at full strength they are a tool of horribly destructive power. Only Blood magi may use the stones to their full potential, but any mage can use the power within to augment their casting abilities. We must strike before the Bloodstone is charged any further, or, Nature forbid, a Blood mage arrives and utilizes the artifact to its full potential. Even disregarding that horrible possibility, we cannot allow such a powerful enemy encampment to establish itself on your doorstep. The time to move is now!”

The silence was pregnant around the table. After a few moments, Richter asked, “Well how do we do it then?”

“We have the rest of the night to figure it out,” Hisako responded. “On the morrow, we go to war.”





CHAPTER 14 – Day 140 – Kuborn 30, 15,386 EBG




They debated different strategies. Richter had first proposed poisoning the goblins. He remembered how just he and Sion had been able to kill more than fifty goblins after first weakening them with poison. It wouldn’t work, though. There were multiple cooking pots around the camp, and there was no way they could reach them all. Terrod asked if more reinforcements could be brought from the Hearth Tree, but it would take several days for them to arrive. Hisako wasn’t willing to wait that long.

“Our best course of action will be to insert a small strike force into the valley,” Yoshi finally said. “We will have to approach the guard contingent stationed in the valley pass in stealth.”

Richter looked at the rocky pass again, noticing the lack of trees. The sprites were masters of concealment, but that was based on their racial ability, Forest Concealment. In other terrains, he questioned the wood sprites’ ability to pull off what Yoshi was proposing. He said as much.

Yoshi wasn’t offended. He simply nodded, “That is why we will be using my own personal war party.”

“You have the War Leader skill?” Richter asked in surprise.

Yoshi gave him a look like he was a bug, “I am a journeyman war leader, little initiate.”

“How did you know my rank? And who are you calling little? And if you have the War Leader skill, why didn’t you make one when we were fighting the crypt mistress?”

The sword adept shrugged, “That was your quest. Not mine.”

“What the fuck is wrong with you sprites?” Richter growled in irritation. “That’s the same shit Sion said to me, right before I was eaten by wolves!” His Companion didn’t make eye contact, finding the ceiling extremely interesting at the moment.

Based on the change in the sword adept’s glare, he had now decided that Richter was a creepy, hairy bug, “As I was saying, my elite fighters are well trained in the art of stealth. We will kill every goblin manning the guard station.”

“You mean we will,” Richter said firmly.

“You have never trained with us,” Yoshi said shaking his head. “You will only be in the way.”

“I am not the weak fighter you began to train months ago,” Richter retorted. “If we are to attack this encampment together as allies, then I will be part of the attack. Besides, as you already know, I am a war leader as well. I may only be an initiate, but I have badges and promotions that can help. Now, how many men were you going to bring?” Richter asked.

Yoshi didn’t look convinced, but he responded, “Ideally twenty for a job like this. We don’t have that many elite fighters with us, though. I only have ten, and half of them have undergone the meitu’meidon.”

“Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. You have been here for a week,” Sion said. “The pixie bonding typically lasts seven days, more or less. All fifty or so sprites that are undergoing the meitu’meidon should be done with the bonding sometime tomorrow.”

Richter looked back at Hisako, “I know you said that time is of the essence, but waiting one more day might give us another fifty-three meidon sprites to join the battle. Don’t forget; their Imbue Arrow skill will be enhanced. It could make all the difference.”

Hisako and Yoshi shared a look. The sword adept cocked his head consideringly and raised his eyebrows. He apparently approved of Richter’s reasoning, but acknowledged the final decision lay with the Hearth Mother said. After a moment, she said, “Fine. It will give us more time to prepare, but we leave tomorrow night. The best time to attack will be before daybreak. It will make a stealth attack easier to perform. We will need to move quickly through the forest.”

“I’ll be able to help with that,” Richter said. “I have bought badges in my War Leader skill that increase movement through forests by 40%.”

“Huh, maybe you will not be completely dead weight,” Yoshi said.

Richter just grunted and ignored the annoying half-breed. Before he could say anything else, Liddle piped in, “You cannot wait. Another one of the prisoners will be killed if we wait a day!” He leaned over the Knowledge Table, blocking their view of the map.

Richter looked at him sympathetically, “I understand that your brothers are still being held, but we have to maximize our chances for success. Launching an unsuccessful attack will only cause our deaths and leave them captive. I know you most likely feel guilty over being free, but I will not send my people to their deaths.” His voice grew firm, possibly even harsh, but he didn’t waver. “Now, please, step back.”

The already soul-weary hill sprite didn’t have it in him to resist Richter’s will. He moved to a chair by the wall and crumpled into it. His pixie hovered by his face, offering solace in his guilty misery.

Richter turned back to Yoshi, “Alright, so we take out the guard station, ideally without being detected. What then?”

Yoshi looked at the map again. “Most of the valley is grassland, but there are woods near the western entrance. Once we are in, the rest of the army will follow us and take up a hidden position in the woods. My team-” Richter leaned towards him with a stern look. Yoshi huffed, but acknowledged the point, “The team will then make its way to the encampment. We have three objectives. Destroying or neutralizing the Bloodstone is goal number one. Freeing the captives is our second objective, and destroying the enemy host is third.”

“Do you perhaps have the first two objectives switched?” Terrod asked quietly.

Yoshi looked at him levelly, one fighter to another, “I serve the forest. All life is precious to me, so please believe me when I say that I feel pity for those poor souls that are trapped by the goblins. The Bloodstone is a danger to the entire forest, however. One has not been seen in centuries. The goblins cannot be allowed to maintain control of it. It could cause the death of thousands.”

“You’re wrong,” Richter interjected.

“I know this may seem harsh, Master Richter,” Hisako said, “but hard choices have to be made.”

The chaos seed shook his head, “That’s not what I meant.” He hated himself for what he was going to say next, but this enemy camp was a real threat. Over the next ten minutes, he explained what he had seen while reliving the Witch Doctor’s memory. When he was done, he clarified his position. “The goblins brought the Bloodstone to the valley. If it is as rare and important as you say…” He trailed off, the implication clear.

Sion was the one who spoke up, “That means that whatever is in the valley is potentially more valuable to the goblins than even a Bloodstone.” From his sad tone, he had come to the same conclusion as his Companion.

“Yes,” Richter said. “Our second priority, if not our very first, is to find and take whatever has drawn the goblins to the valley.”

Not one to waste any time, Yoshi nodded, “Lord Richter is correct. That means we will need to adjust our plans somewhat.” He pointed to Liddle, Terrod, and Caulder, “Attend me. I need to know the capabilities of the Mist Village warriors, and I have more specific questions regarding the valley.”

Richter faded back. As much as he wanted to help, everyone else at the table probably knew more about planning a raid than he did. His ego wasn’t so big that he didn’t know when to follow. Hisako walked around the table to stand next to him. The look she gave him was one of intense consideration.

“What is it?” he asked.

She didn’t respond for a full minute, continuing to stare at him, but then she said, “So much has happened since you have come to the forest. You have found and claimed a Place of Power. You have brought the pixies back to The Land and have grown a Quickening. On the other hand, you seem to have awakened a slumbering, undead evil. And now, mere miles from your village, a Bloodstone has surfaced. An object that features in the nightmares of my people. This is not even the first artifact of evil power that you have shown me.”

Richter knew immediately what she was referencing. When she had appeared with her three hundred strong war party a week ago, he had shown her the crystals that he had gained from the dark aberration. He had been sure that she could help him finish a secret quest, Who Will You Be II. Her reaction had not been what he had been expecting. Hisako had literally hissed when he had taken the black jewels out of his Bag of Holding. It was only after he had put the jewels away again that she had took a deep breath and calmed herself.

She had gone on to explain her reaction. The pure, Dark energy had been anathema to her as a Light Master. According to Hisako, the affinities of everyone in The Land were not randomly allotted, but instead reflected a core part of their being. Hisako had a high affinity for Light magic not just because she controlled a place of Power, but also because whatever qualities Light Magic embodied resonated in her soul. As such, the pure darkness of the gems was equally dissonant to her personality.

It all seemed a bit cyclical and confusing to Richter. It also revealed another facet of his Limitless ability, however. If he could interact with any type of magic or power, what did that mean about his own nature? He didn’t grasp the full implications yet, but in his heart, he knew it would be important in the future.

Still, he had not rejoiced in the new knowledge. Instead, Richter had only focused on her reaction. If she couldn’t help him with his quest, he didn’t know who could. After her initial reaction, though, Hisako had him relate the entire story. He talked about the battle with the dark aberration and finding the gems afterward. He also told her that the gems were the corrupted souls of the aberration’s victims through the centuries. He had also told her about the quests that gave him a choice to use the soul stones to power his own enchantments or to find a Light master to free the souls. Her face had lost the look of anger, but she still glanced with disgust at his bag. She had stared so long that Richter had thought she was trying to destroy the crystals with her mind. A ludicrous idea until you realized that she was the Master of a Place of Power and had a level so high that his Analyze skill didn’t work on her.

Thankfully, she just calmed down and had told him that she could cleanse the taint from the stones and free the souls, but only once they were back at the Hearth Tree. It was only there that she could use the full extent of her powers. He had nodded, regretful that she could not help immediately, but happy that there was hope for the tortured souls held within the crystals. The Hearth Mother had also made it clear that Richter should not show her the dark jewels again until they were ready to be destroyed.

Richter had considered the matter closed. Now, it seemed that she was questioning if the appearance of the dark crystals, the rise of the undead and now the appearance of the Bloodstone had not just involved him, but perhaps had happened because of him.

When she spoke, she did so softly. Not in recrimination, but instead it was almost in pity, “The very first time we met, all I saw was a dirty human in roughspun clothes. What I felt, however, was that somehow a universe of possibilities stood before me. I told you that I did not detect evil in you, but that was not exactly true. My magic showed absolute horror and absolute beauty coexisting in one moment, and a completely blank slate in the next. I believe I have taken your measure, Master Richter, and in my opinion you are more likely to choose good than evil. It does not change that all of these amazing and horrible things are happening however, and they all seem to involve you.”

Richter just looked at her with his mouth slightly open, “I don’t know what to tell you. I’m just me.”

Hisako finally broke her stare, and looked back at the table, “We shall see, Master Richter. We shall see.”





CHAPTER 15 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter slept like the dead. His Belt of Sustenance greatly decreased the food, drink and sleep that he needed, but he was still flesh and blood. The battles, stress and emotional onslaught all took their toll. The war planning had gone on for another hour or so, but it had really just involved some fine-tuning of Yoshi’s original plan. He gave his own room to Hisako again and so had just balled up his cloak and slept on the floor of the conference room. His back was knotted from sleeping on rock, but a few stretches and cracks made him feel right as rain.

Alma was asleep on his chest, making that faint rumbling purr that she always did when she was content. With a mischievous grin, he poked her belly. She opened one eye in what could only be called severe irritation and looked at her master. When she saw his grin, she blew a strong gust of air up his nose. It was powerful enough that it made his eye twitch and he shouted, “Gah!” She jumped into the air with a toot of triumph.

*I was sleeping, master,* she thought to him in a scolding tone, *and I don’t have a magic belt that makes me annoyingly awake in the middle of the night.*

*My god, you’re touchy,* he thought back, amused at the indignant little dragonling.

*I flew over thirty miles yesterday!*

*Exactly,* Richter responded, goading her on, *You got to fly. I had to walk and fight undead! You just got to float along, you lazy thing.*

*Lazy? LAZY? Master you have no idea how much-*

Richter just chuckled to himself as he got up and started walking out of the catacombs. Alma flew behind him, all sleepiness forgotten as she kept up a running train of psychic communication to her master. The chaos seed thanked his lucky stars that half-listening to women as he walked was a skill he had mastered before even coming to The Land.

Soon they emerged from the tunnel and into the open air. The rain had stopped falling and the sky was remarkably clear. Alma had stopped berating him during the several-hundred-yard walk and now sat on his shoulder, her tail wrapped around his arm. Richter enjoyed the nighttime view of his village for a few seconds before starting off at a jog. There was work to be done.

The last thing he had done before going to sleep had been to give Futen an order. The remnant had been told to arrange for all of the smiths to be in the Forge of Heavens by daybreak. Richter estimated that was less than an hour away. He made his way through the quiet village and soon the Core building came into view. The red glow of an awakened forge shone from within and brought a smile to his face.

As he got closer, he could hear Bowdin’s gruff voice echoing out of the building, “Get that fire built higher. Ay told you to have that ore ready for smelting! Are ye trying to make me look bad? Ay swear that if ye embarrass me in front of his lordship, ay will use yer head as my new chamber pot! Ye should know, ay have got the runs!”

Gross as that was, it seemed like a motivating threat because all Richter heard in response was “Yes, smith!” as he walked into the Forge.

Bowdin greeted him with a broad grin on his bearded face, “Greetings, yer lordship! Yer early. What can this bunch of hammer swingers do for ye?”

All of the smiths looked up to see why their lord had needed them to be available so early. Richter looked around and said, “We have one day to enchant as much high quality weaponry and armor as we can. It may make the difference between life and death for our forces. I won’t let our people go out in low quality gear, but any project that you have already started will be finished today. Tonight, our village goes to war.”

Many of the smiths had looked ornery over having to be up so early. More than one looked to be nursing a hangover. When they heard what was at stake though, their expressions became deadly serious. The smiths might be a strong headed bunch, but almost all of them believed in the work they were doing to build the village.

Bowdin turned to the rest of the smiths, “Well, ye heard his lordship! Let’s get to work! He ho!”

The dwarven smiths shouted back, “Ho ha!” in unison. The few human smiths didn’t know the call, but they looked equally enthusiastic to help. Bowdin called out a second time, “He ho!” and this time all of the smiths shouted out, louder and with more enthusiasm. By his third call, the response was thundering, “HO HAAA!” The smiths exploded into action.

“What would you like to do first, yer lordship?” Bowdin asked. He had to pitch his voice loudly over the clamor of the awakened forge.

“Break out the moonstone,” Richter said.

The chaos seed had always known that the limiting factor in making enchanted weaponry would be filled soul stones. To that end, he had arranged for any of his villagers that knew the spell Soul Trap to hunt with strike squads around the periphery of the village. The influx of soul stones had increased recently as the ranks of the guards had swelled over the past few weeks. Richter’s ability to summon hundreds of mist workers a day had had the unexpected effect of driving unskilled workers into militia service. The guard contingent of the Mist Village now numbered one hundred and nine, even counting the losses of the three guards the day before. Including the meidon sprites, Richter could now field a fighting force of close to two hundred. He had never expected that allowing Elora to bond to the Quickening would have brought him nearly a hundred highly skilled magic archers.

One of the things that had been on Richter’s mind was how many of his people he could commit to the attack. Though Confusing Mist was a powerful defense, it was by no means a perfect bulwark against the dangers of the forest. The Witch Doctor had shown that magic could overcome the settlement’s defense spell. The enchantment also did not work against nonsentients or higher level beings. There was no reason to think that angels or demons would attack the village, but monsters and dangerous beasts abounded in the surrounding land. He couldn’t take his entire fighting force into battle. Some of his forces had to stay behind.

He had decided to order everyone that would be left behind to gather in the meadow when he left. He would leave a contingent of twenty sprites and thirty melee guardsmen, including three Life magi. Roswan had done his job well and the hill that led up to the meadow had two walls, one at the bottom and one at the top. Both were made of marbled quartz with high steel gates. Theoretically, if there was an attack, his people should be able to hold those choke points for quite a long time. The archers could also fire from the meadow to hit anyone that was stuck on the slope leading up to the gate. Those picked were given the duty of finding more soul stones. Everyone that would be marching to war was told to rest for the day.

For hours, Richter worked in the smithy. He wished that Gloran could have helped with the enchanting, but the elf had been taken for his Trial along with many of the other villagers. The week he would be gone was a small price to pay in the long run, but it had come at such an inopportune time. Richter cursed Nexus many times throughout the day, but never for long. There was work to be done. Ultimately, it was the lack of soul stones that led him to stop. Though the upcoming battle was important, the chaos seed wasn’t willing to sacrifice anything higher than a common level soul stone. Luminous stones and above were just too rare and precious.

Because of the shortage, he also had to avoid maximizing the enchantments he used. It took three common souls to maximize the enchantments he could create. Richter simply didn’t have enough captured spirits to commit three souls for each weapon and piece of armor. Still, the weapons and armor that were made might just turn the tide of battle.

Depending on which smith forged which weapon, the quality would change. Quality not only affected the damage each weapon was capable of inflicting, but also heavily influenced the object’s enchantment potential. While Bowdin’s work typically let him get weapons up to the seventh enchantment rank, the weapons produced by the other smiths only let him reach the fifth or sixth rank. He wouldn’t have been able to enchant to even that rank if not for his high skill level in Enchanting. As a journeyman, Richter could add fifteen points to an item’s enchanting potential and one of his Talents increased the potential by another 20%. It was true that being a Professed Enchanter didn’t have the direct combat potential of a Warrior or a Mage, but there was no denying the power of it. After hours of work, the end result was some badass weaponry!

They worked through lunch and into the afternoon. Some of the human smiths had to leave the smithy, their stamina exhausted and overcome by the heat. The dwarves continued, though. While some of the dwarven smiths mocked the humans, Bowdin admitted to Richter that dwarves burned less stamina than other races in general, but especially when it came to actions like mining and smithing. It answered a question that had always stumped Richter. In battle, Krom’s endurance had fallen almost as quickly as anyone else’s, but the smith could swing a hammer all day and night without flagging. Richter smiled thinking about how he would throw that in the dwarf’s face when he came back. More than once, Krom had mocked Richter for having to rest when the chaos seed swung a hammer.

Ultimately, he was able to enchant another twelve weapons and six mail shirts. It wasn’t enough to outfit his entire force, but it would have to do. He also refilled the charges on all existing magic weaponry. He would leave it to Caulder and Terrod to decide who would receive the magic weaponry and who wouldn’t. There was more to be done.

Richter grabbed some cold meat from the feast area and washed it down with a cup of fruit juice. His people greeted him, but he spent only a few minutes sitting before he was on the move again. His next stop was the Dragon’s Cauldron. Randolphus had been given the task of letting Tabia know about the upcoming battle.

The dark-skinned elf had come back from her Trial as a Professed Alchemist. She had started creating health, mana and stamina potions every day, but she had also been working on several “experiments.” When Richter had asked what they were, she had just smiled coyly and said that she didn’t want to “spoil the surprise.” The coyness was so out of character for the former mercenary that Richter had let the matter drop. In the days since, she had spent almost all of her time in the Dragon’s Cauldron. Strange smells and colored gases could be seen escaping the glass building at all hours of the day and night. Some of the gardeners had complained, but since no real damage was being done, Richter let it go. He just hoped that she had something ready that would help. The chaos seed wasn’t disappointed.

Walking into the Cauldron, he was struck again by how strange the inside of the building was. “Strange” actually wasn’t the right word, Richter realized. “Unexpected” fit much better. The Land was analogous to medieval times in many ways, but it was not a perfect analogy. In some ways, the magic and technology of The Land went beyond what was available on Earth. The inside of the Dragon’s Cauldron looked like a high-tech chemistry lab rather than a darkened apothecary’s den. Glass beakers and eye droppers were everywhere. There was even a shower in one corner, supplied by a type of magical plumbing.

Tabia was slowly titrating a cloudy, yellow solution into a small beaker of clear liquid. When each drop fell into the beaker, a red bloom of smoke rose from the surface for a moment. Amazingly, each bloom of smoke formed a figure before dissipating. Despite the urgency of the day, Richter decided just to watch for a few moments. Every few seconds another drop fell, and the figure grew more distinct. After a few minutes, Richter saw that it had four legs and a tail. Ten minutes after that, the smoke formed a perfectly detailed red fox. It bared its teeth at Tabia, then slowly dissolved. Its red color leached into the liquid which began to bubble. The chaos seed’s eyes grew slightly wide as the liquid became even more turbulent.

Quickly, but smoothly, she picked the beaker up and moved over to a waiting tray. There were indentations in the tray, three across and five deep, like an egg carton. Sparkling powder was in each tray. With surprise, Richter realized it was powdered crystal. Looking at it, he guessed that about five measures of the precious ingredient were sitting there on the tray. It was worth several gold. Despite his instinctual twinge at seeing such wealth being used all at once, he decided to hold his peace and trust his Alchemist.

The potion was bubbling hard now. The reaction was getting so violent that Tabia was forced to hold the beaker in both hands. She began to pour the solution onto the prepared crystal. With a sure hand, she poured a dollop into each indentation, not spilling a drop. Each measure of potion interacted with the crystal, first dissolving it, then precipitating. By the time that she was done pouring the potion, all fifteen piles of powdered crystal had been covered.

“What is that?” he finally asked.

Tabia looked at him in surprise. His sprite boots apparently made him quiet enough that she hadn’t heard him even with her acute, elven hearing. Either that or she had simply been distracted by the dangerous alchemy she was engaged in. Either way, she was not happy. Her elvish oath roughly translated to, ‘By the cancerous sphincter of disease-ridden drow!”

“My lord!” she continued. “You should not sneak up on me!” She took a deep breath and centered herself, “As you are already here, however, please help. Open that cabinet.”

She indicated a glass cabinet that was built into the structure of the Core building. “This one?” he asked. She nodded her head vigorously and then looked at the tray in her hands. The powder-solution mixtures were starting to rise like bread, forming fifteen red bubbles. Apparently, time was a factor. He quickly opened the glass cabinet, or tried to. It had a latch lock that took a few seconds to figure out.

“My lord!” she said, drawing out the second syllable to urge him to move faster. He finally got the door open and she placed the tray inside. She slammed the door shut and latched it with a sigh of relief. The bubbles had already risen to twice the depth of the indentations.

“What the hell is that?” Richter asked. She was looking at the reaction in fascination.

“What?” she asked with a blank and innocent expression. “Oh, that?” she asked again, pointing to the cubby.

“You know goddamn well ‘that!’” Richter snapped. “Why do I get the feeling that we both almost died?”

She grinned, “That, my lord, is red foxfire. It is a form of solid alchemy that I have been working on for the last two weeks since I achieved my Profession! The main ingredient, crimson daidenroot, is actually fairly common in the lands around the village.”

“That’s great, Tabia. You still haven’t told me what it does.”

“Oh. I would have thought that was obvious, Lord Richter. It explodes.”

Richter looked at her. Then he cocked his head and looked at her. She just kept smiling. “Explodes?” he finally asked.

“Yes,” she said, nodding and smiling broader. After another few moments of looking at each other, she said, “I thought it might be useful if you could get it near some enemies.”

A small smirk started forming on Richter’s face as well. He looked at the tray through the door of the glass cabinet, “And what is the cabinet for? Is it a zero-oxygen area required to finish the reaction? Or maybe an oven of some kind?”

She shook her head, “No. Nothing else is required. The alchemy is simply maturing on its own now.”

“Then why did we have to put it in the cubby?” Richter asked, still smiling.

“That is simply a safety precaution, my lord. In case one of the alchemies proved unstable. The detonation would trigger a cascade of explosions in the other fourteen solutions that could turn us both into red mist.”

Richter’s smile slipped.

Tabia kept talking, her tone academic. “This is actually the fourth time I’ve done this particular reaction. I do not know the exact formula you see. I have been using the Cauldron’s ability to experiment with the local resources.”

Richter’s smile fell off his face completely. His lips started twisting into a sour expression, but he still understood, that her dangerous experimentation was necessary. One of the Dragon Cauldron’s abilities was to give information about combinations of ingredients and whether it was possible to make a potion out of them. It was one of the most useful traits of the building, because it took much of the guesswork out of finding new recipes. All knowledge in The Land was jealously guarded and could be more valuable than gold. The only problem was that the ability could only be used once per day. He was actually surprised that she had stumbled on a new recipe so quickly.

“Even with the Cauldron’s ability, I can’t believe that you found a new formula in the two weeks that you’ve been back,” Richter said.

“I understand your point. I have to thank Queen Elora for that.”

“What does my Companion have to do with anything?” Richter asked.

“She is a Professed Herbalist,” Tabia said excitedly. “With her help and the perks of my journeyman rank in Alchemy, that was all it took!” The chaos seed thought she was being a bit fangirl, but then he realized that an Herbalist and an Alchemist were kind of a match made in heaven. “She has a Talent that lets her see up to six uses for any plant. I just gathered four or five that had explosive or fire properties and experimented. By the fifth day, I had stumbled upon a working combination! The vessels in the central cauldron started to throb. At first I was concerned, but then my mind was filled with the formula!”

The central cauldron had vessels running through its walls like a circulatory system. Richter could well understand being freaked out when it started beating like a heart. The building had been made out of the blood of an aged, crystal dragon. Richter still wasn’t completely sure that it wasn’t alive in some way. He had another question though.

“If you learned the formula more than a week ago, why haven’t you told me about it before now?”

Tabia nodded, “It takes about three days to create it, and it is a very difficult formula. It has failed several times already. Even when it seems to be progressing well, it has a tendency to explode. I haven’t been able to stabilize the reaction yet.”

“Well how strong is the explosion?” he asked.

“I have never gotten to this point, so I cannot say how strong the final reaction would be. I can say that you do not want to be nearby when these detonate though.” She tapped her face and he noticed for the first time that her eyebrows were missing. A scant bit of stubble showed where they were growing back. His eyes widened and she nodded again. “I was fifteen feet away.”

“You weren’t hurt?” Richter asked. He would have expected at least some faint burns.

Tabia looked embarrassed, and simply said, “Sumiko.”

Once again, the Life master had saved the life and limbs of one of his villagers. He didn’t want to think about what state his people would be in without her. He prayed that the Hearth Mother’s healing magic would be enough to save the lives of his people after the inevitable wounds they would receive in the upcoming battle.

“So after losing your eyebrows, you decided to put the solutions in a cubby until you knew it was safe,” he said. It made sense. Despite being clear like any glass back on earth and sharing the same name, the substance that made up the Dragon’s Cauldron was impossibly hard. That translated into a durability that was crazy high. The clear cabinet they were standing next to should be just as good as a bomb disposal unit. That being said, he still took a few steps back now that he knew what was going on.

The two of them watched the fifteen bubbles continue to slowly rise. Every once in a while, they would collapse and Richter’s heart would skip a beat, but then they would start rising again. He and Tabia watched this pattern repeat itself several times until each of the fifteen rose a final time and visibly hardened. The entire time they had been observing, the mixture had looked wet and smooth, like red, latex paint. Now, the surface of each golf ball-sized sphere was craggy, though still a deep red. No more movement could be seen.

“Now what?” Richter asked.

“I have no idea,” she said frankly. “I have never gotten this far before.”

“So how do we know when they are safe?”

She just looked at him for a few moments, blinking. When she spoke, he had to resist the urge to strangle her, “Uhhhh, you could touch it.”

Richter closed his eyes and prayed for strength. He had been transported to a magical land, across probably a bajillion parsecs of space, become the head of a fledgling village, unlocked Mastery of two branches of magic… and was still being given the same stupid fucking advice that had started this whole thing! He opened his eyes and sighed deeply. Dumb as the advice was, all in all, it had worked out for him the last time.

Part of him wanted to drag the moment out and ask Tabia if she wanted to be the one to open the cabinet, but he knew that he was the right choice. If he died, he would be reborn after all. If he lost Tabia she wouldn’t be coming back. It would be a personal loss and a great blow to the village. Richter told her to take cover. She started to protest that it was her responsibility, but he just waved her away. If it was to be done, best to be done quickly, and he had never had tolerance for wasting time. After she was safe, he opened the cabinet, keeping his body behind the door. It wasn’t much protection, but if the introduction of more air catalyzed a reaction, it would be better than nothing.

A second later, he was still in one piece and he opened the cubby the rest of the way. He picked up one of the red crystals.

You have found:

Crystallized Red Foxfire.

Richter smiled broadly, though he gingerly placed the foxfire back into the tray. She had made him grenades! Well not grenades exactly, more like highly unstable napalm, but still, it rocked! He closed the cabinet again as he turned to speak with her. No reason to take chances.

“This is amazing, Tabia! I don’t understand the relevance of the potion’s level though. I thought that just dealt with potion duration.”

“For liquid alchemy, it normally does, my lord. Potion level can also describe the area of effect for certain alchemies like this, however.”

Always more to learn, Richter thought. “Do you have the ingredients to make more?”

“I have most of what we need and should be able to find the rest relatively easily. I used up two of the ingredients when I made these five doses though.”

“Five? There are fifteen.”

Tabia clarified, “Each dose makes three crystals.”

Richter nodded in understanding, “Even so, I didn’t see you use the Cauldron's duplication ability. How did you make the fifth one?” He knew that for each rank an alchemist achieved, they could make one dose of a potion. Novices could only make one dose at a time, while a journeyman like Tabia should only be able to make four. He didn’t know where the extra dose came from.

She shook her head with a smile, “Just one of the perks of being a Professional. I bought the Talent Additional Doses I. It increases my brewing limit. I am also not sure that we could use the Cauldron’s duplication ability with this alchemy, my lord. You saw how unstable the mixture is until it is added to the powdered crystal. I could try, but five doses going off all at once…”

Richter shook his head, “You’re right. It’s not worth the risk, to just try it willie nillie. Still, see if you can find a way.”

“I will,” she assured him. “For now, let me show you what else I have.”

“I want to see, but first, we have to test something.” He started emptying his Bag of Holding. She looked at him in curiosity but held her peace. It took longer than he thought it would. Over time he had accumulated a good deal of bric-a-brac. Her eyes widened when she saw him remove entire chests from the flat bag. It took some time, but then it was empty.

Richter slowly opened the cabinet again and placed a foxfire crystal into his Bag. Then he left the Cauldron. Walking thirty feet away, he placed his bag on the ground. Tabia looked at him in utter confusion now. That expression turned to one of horror when he started wailing on the bag with his sheathed sword.

“Are you crazy?” she screamed.

He ignored her and gave the bag a few more good whacks until he was satisfied. Then he put the bag back on and reentered the alchemy lab. Tabia filed in a few seconds later, her eyes wide and her mouth hanging open. She watched while he put his belongings back in his Bag of Holding. Seeing the incredulous look on her face, Richter shrugged, “Had to make sure the damn thing wouldn’t go off while it was in my bag. Now what else did you have to show me?”

Muttering about the craziness of humans, she brought out the rest of her stock. She had several hundred health, mana and stamina potions prepared, of varying potencies. He collected them all, planning to distribute most amongst his fighters. She also brought out a few dozen vials of poison. Those he planned to keep for himself.

You have found:

Poison of the Muddied Leech

Alchemy Class: Uncommon.

Alchemy Level: Solution.

Alchemy Strength: Processed.

Weight: 0.1 kg

Traits: Causes 57-75 points of Earth magic (24%) and Poison damage (76%) per second for 10-12 seconds.





“How?” Richter asked in wonder. This stuff was deadly. It wasn’t as powerful as shriek venom, but still! “Wait,” he said. The name of the poison was tickling something in his memory, “is this from-”

“The Assassin’s poison,” Tabia finished excitedly. “I was able to alter the recipe to increase it from a tincture to a solution. The local equivalent of a corrupt leech was a muddied leech, and it changed the Death damage to Earth damage. In light of its effectiveness, I did not think you would mind,” she said with a smile. The woman really enjoyed her work. “This is much stronger than the original venom.”

Tabia said she would keep working on potions throughout the day. Richter thanked and congratulated her before moving on. There were more stops to make.

The next place he went was the skath nest. As busy as he was, he hadn’t forgotten the importance of spending time with the young monsters. The greater the imprint bond, the stronger and more loyal the beasts would be in the future. The twins were also there. They invited him to “swim” as per usual, but there was no time for it. After only five minutes, he started walking towards the Quickening.

Sion was right. Almost fifty sprites should be emerging from the silver meidon shells today. As Richter walked up, he was delighted to see scores of changed sprites. Just like his Companion, they had all grown a foot in height and their faces had adopted a look of perfect vitality. He was less excited by the fact that the forest and wood sprites were shouting curses at one another.

“Look at the fancy sprites in their matchey matchey outfits!” one of the forest sprites shouted.

“Do not be jealous that our parents knew each other and could clothe us in more than animal skins!” a wood sprite shouted back.

“I could not hear you. I was distracted by the cute perfume you are wearing.” Another forest sprite said.

Hisako and Yoshi stood by watching the interplay. Richter didn’t understand why she hadn’t taken controlled the situation yet. Even if the forest sprites did not like wood sprites, the Hearth Mother’s presence should have been enough to quell snarling dogs, let alone a couple of frat boys having a pissing contest. When they made eye contact she just looked at him while the shouting worsened, and he understood. This was his land, that meant it was his problem.

“Enough!” Richter roared. All eyes turned towards him. “I am the lord of these lands. I am the liege of Queen Elora. My word is what matters here, not the petulant mewling of those who would fight their allies!”

He looked around fiercely, staring into each face. The anger that had been on their faces drained away. The chaos seed continued, “We have a true enemy to face. There are goblins on our doorstep sacrificing men, women and children. Humans, elves and sprites! We have waited a full day so that you could finish the bonding and fight with us. We sacrificed another life, so that you could fight against these foes! Now, what do I find instead of warriors? Petty children!”

Hisako finally spoke up as well, “Our old enemies are at our doorstep. Those green-skinned devils have dared to come into our forest. Will we let them stay?”

A ragged chorus of “No” came from both groups.

“Will we let them torture and kill our people? Will sprites stand by while evil is done?” she asked louder.

The shouts were louder this time, “No!”

“Will you stand in the name of the sorat’shin? Will you fight our ancient enemies? Will you answer the call to battle?” she shouted at a volume that belied her small frame.

“YESSS!” came the calls. Though it was clear there were old tensions between the wood sprites and their forest cousins, they still agreed on at least two things: the honor they paid to their common forebearers, the sorat’shin or ‘true sprites,’ and their hatred of the sprites’ racial enemies, the goblins.

She nodded to them, then looked at Richter and stepped back. He nodded back in appreciation. All eyes came to rest upon him again, “You are no longer wood sprites, or forest sprites. You have bonded. You have fulfilled the ancient ritual of the shetu’meidon and become more than you were before. All of you have bonded to the other half of your souls. These petty arguments are for the past. They are for who you were, I say! I say you are not who you were! I say you are meidon sprites!”

All the changes sprites present cheered and took up a call, “Meidon! Meidon! Meidon!”

A prompt appeared in Richter’s vision.

Your relationship with all Meidon Sprites has improved by one rank!

Know This! You have changed the way that the bonded sprites view themselves. This change will continue in the hearts and minds of all bonded sprites. “As is within so shall be without.” All sprites who bond with pixies formally have a change in race to: Meidon Sprites! This will continue for all future meitu’meidon.

Congratulations! You have won +500 Fame points! Your words and actions have led to the reemergence of a forgotten race, the Meidon Sprites. Total Fame Points: 11,582

Richter quickly read through the prompts in surprise. Once again, the point that words mattered in The Land was driven home. Looking over at his best friend, he used Analyze.

Sion’s attributes were what he had expected. His friend had leveled recently and so had received the +3 to Dexterity that all meidon sprites received. The sprite also looked to have invested his remaining three characteristic points into Intelligence. None of this was surprising, though between the higher characteristic points and the eight magic rings his Companion was wearing, Richter was happy to see that his three primary stats were all getting respectable. Gone were the days that a casually thrown goblin dagger could end his friend’s life.

No, what was surprising was that, just as the prompt had indicated, Sion’s race had changed. Previously, all of the sprites that underwent the shetu’meidon, the bonding, had kept their old race when they emerged from their silver shells. The word “meidon” had just been in parentheses. The chaos seed quickly checked all of the other bonded sprites and found the same was true for them.

Also surprising was that Sion had a Mark now. As far as Richter could remember, his friend hadn’t had any marks before. He was about to ask when the sprite called out in surprise. Sion held his hand in shock. On the back of his right hand, a sigil appeared. It was a silver bow with a nocked arrow. A blue flame surrounded the arrow. Everyone looked at it in surprise until it disappeared a moment later.

Richter was wondering what the implications were for that when another prompt appeared.

Quest Update: Unity of the Sorat’Shin II. You have merged wood and forest sprites into a new unified race! All old enmities are now forgotten. This is another step towards the reemergence of Sorat’Shin, the True Sprites. Continue to heal the wounds between the sprite peoples to fulfill your quest.

Quest Update: Unity of the Sorat’Shin II. Your Companion, Sion, was the first of this new race. He has been awarded the Mark, First Meidon. He will now be seen as the natural leader of this new race. All meidon sprites have increased damage when fighting near him. +0.1 damage per meidon sprite in the vicinity.

He looked over at Sion in shock. His friend had just become… a boss? Hisako seemed to know something as well, because she started smiling broadly. Angry shouts had been replaced by rueful laughter as they all intermingled, no longer divided by the enmities of their old lives. It also didn’t escape Richter’s notice that many of the meidon sprites looked to his friend with respect in their eyes. With the fighting done, their allegiance to the chaos seed asserted itself. One of the sprites walked up to Richter and knelt. Soon all of the other newly reborn sprites followed suit and, like that, the population of the Mist Village grew again.





CHAPTER 16 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter accepted all of their oaths of fealty. He quickly told them that they would be following Sion’s orders after his. Not a one had a problem with that in light of his friend’s new mark. The chaos seed also made it clear that for the purposes of the upcoming attacks, Yoshi and Hisako were to be obeyed without question. A wry twist came to his face as he commented on how most of them would probably need Hisako to resize their armor.

The Hearth Mother laughed as well and assured him that she would handle it before the battle. She did mention that she might run short of mana however. He handed her a few blue replenishment potions. Richter then turned to leave when something occurred to him. He walked over to Sion and asked his friend to follow him.

“I don’t know why I didn’t think of this before,” Richter began, “but your Enhanced Imbue Arrow is a skill. That means I should be able to learn it.”

Sion looked at him with a bit of doubt in his face, “I am not sure that this is something that you can do, brother.”

“You said the same thing when I asked you to teach me Imbue Arrow,” Richter reminded him. “I definitely learned how to do that.” It was strange thinking about how much had changed since then. In a literal sense, less than six months had passed, but in another way, it felt like it had been a lifetime since he came to The Land.

“There is no denying that you are a freak of nature,” Sion quipped back to his friend. “And I have no problem trying to teach you, but I don’t think you have the required equipment.”

Richter sighed a deep sigh, “Let’s just try, okay?”

Sion looked at him in surprise, “Really? You’re just going to let that one slide by? I guess you are serious. Okay, let’s give it a shot. So to speak.”

Richter rolled his eyes at his friend’s weak humor. The two of them walked a bit further away and then faced a wall of bare stone, twenty yards away. Sion looked at his friend for a few seconds. “I am not sure exactly how to explain this. You remember how I explained imbuing before?”

Richter nodded. It had been a turning point in his time in The Land. Imbue Arrow was the skill that had kept him alive more than almost any other. He remembered every word Sion had said, “You told me to imagine my mana as a field around my body, ‘both imperceptibly thin and massively powerful.’ It was the first time you weren’t a total dick to me.”

“Yes,” Sion said with a smile. “The enhanced skill starts the same. The second step of extending the field around the arrow feels the same as well. The final step, however, is where the skill changes.” The sprite paused for a moment before continuing, “I did not understand what I was doing unconsciously at first, but the more I practiced, the more I recognized the truth. I was no longer simply channeling my own power into the field.” He looked at Richter meaningfully.

Richter thought about it for a moment, then the answer was obvious, “Your pixie.”

Sion nodded and raised his voice, “Sapir!”

The air pixie descended from right behind Richter, buzzing by his face. Sion looked at his meitu’meidon mischievously, clearly expecting his Companion to be startled. When the chaos seed remained nonplussed though, he just grunted in dissatisfaction. To cover his irritation, Sion moved faster than the eye could follow. He drew an arrow, sighted on the cliff face, imbued his arrow with mana and Air power and released. The blue aura that always characterized sprite imbued arrows was tinged with a distinctive yellow as it blurred towards the stone. It exploded against the cliff and Richter could see the faintest of yellow, electrical discharges play across the rock for a split second before they dissipated.

Richter considered what he had heard, “Will your enhanced skill work even if you are far from Sapir? He cannot go into battle with us.”

The pixie started protesting immediately, “I can fight. I want to fight, Unca Wichter!”

Sion spoke up so that Richter didn’t have to, “No, Sapir. You are still too young. You will stay here and protect the village.”

The pixie’s wings started beating faster in agitation, “But-”

“He ditte da no picate,” Sion said firmly.

The pixie boy stuck his tongue out at the sprite and flew off towards the Quickening, leaving a trail of disappearing yellow sparkles behind him.

“So you use pixie-speak when you need to be firm?” Richter asked with a small laugh.

Sion smiled after his meitu’meidon, “Sapir is a good lad, but he and his brothers and sisters are all still so young. I will need to get him stronger before he comes into battle.” He turned back to Richter, “The bond he and I have seems to work independent of distance. I have traveled miles from him since we bonded and my arrows still have the Stun capability. You see now though, my friend. Despite your ability, you have no pixie to augment your attacks.”

Richter chuckled, “Who needs a pixie? I have a dragon!”

Alma had been hovering above them all the entire time, which was how the chaos seed had known that Sapir was watching them. She now swooped in from behind Sion and blew air on the back of his neck as she sped past. The sprite’s reaction was much more colorful than Richter’s had been.

“What the hell? Gahhh! You flying rat!”

Sion fell to the ground, cursing Alma the whole time. She gave a toot of triumph that complimented Richter’s loud laughter.

“You are an asshole,” Sion spat from the ground.

Richter raised both eyebrows at his friend and said, “Don’t start shit, won’t be shit.” That earned even worse epithets from the sprite. The chaos seed just chuckled again, and turned his attention to his soul familiar.

*You heard all of that, my love?* Richter asked psychically.

*Yes, master* she responded. *Try to draw on my magic.*

For the next several minutes, Richter imbued his arrows. He went through the steps as slowly as possible. Visualize a mana field, extend it around his arrow, invest his energy into the field. His arrows glowed gold and he released, as he had done countless times before. Alma had access to Air and Life magic and so he thought about drawing on both of those powers, individually and then together.

Nothing.

Richter had her summon her mana, but stop just short of casting a spell. Still, there was no change that he could detect in his shots. People had started to come over and see what their lord was doing, but one look at the frustration on his face communicated that this was personal time. They decided he shouldn’t be bothered.

Sion’s mood improved as he saw the building irritation on Richter’s face.

“Fuck,” Richter said quietly. “What am I missing?” he asked Sion.

“I told you. You need a pixie. When I imbue my arrows, I can draw on the essence of my connection with Sapir.”

Something about the way Sion said it this time pulled at Richter’s mind. Maybe it’s not about the magic, he thought. Maybe it’s about the connection.

He nocked another arrow and imbued it. Rather than trying to draw magic from Alma though, he just found the bright spot in his mind that represented their Psi Bond. This time, something flowed through the small gateway in his psyche and manifested in the real world. Fine ribbons of energy, like white-blue lightning, began to play across the surface of the golden aura surrounding the arrow. In surprise, Richter released his arrow.

The arrow blurred towards the rocks and detonated with its customary boom, but this time he could see secondary damage! The blue-white lightning played across the cliff-face for a moment before disappearing.

“Ya ta!” Richter shouted, throwing both hands in the air.

Congratulations! You have evolved your subskill Imbue Arrow. Your new subskill is Enhanced Imbue Arrow. All levels that you had gained in the original subskill will be transferred to this evolved subskill. Changes include:

1) The baseline mana flow of 10:1 mana:sec has improved to 20:1.

2) The baseline mana:damage ratio of 10:1 has improved to 5:1.

3) The original leveling bonus of investing mana 5% faster has improved to 10% per level.

This was awesome! If he was reading the prompt right, then his enhanced subskill let him pour mana into his shots faster. More than that, Enhanced Imbue Arrow doubled the damage for the mana invested! Basically, meidon sprites could hit twice as hard and twice as fast as they could before the bonding. The sprites believed that pixies possessed the other half of their destiny. If that destiny was opening a can of whoop ass, then Richter definitely agreed! To make it even better, every level he gained in the subskill increased the mana flow by ten percent rather than five now! There were even more changes waiting on successive prompts.

4) Your connection with your Psi Dragonling allows you to invest extra Psychic damage into imbued shots. Deepening your connection with your familiar will increase this damage.

5) The stability of your imbued field has greatly increased. You will be able to imbue a great deal more mana into your arrows before risking instability.

Know This! Your familiar’s advanced level has increased the potency of your Psychic attack. The following effects will now be added to your imbued shots:

Psi Damage: Net Strength of Imbued shots increased by 1% per familiar level. Total increase: +35%.

Level 1 familiar: Chance to cause Mind Fog. Requires 25 mana invested.

Level 5 familiar: Increased chance to cause Mind Fog. Requires 50 mana invested.

Level 10 familiar: Greatly increased chance to cause Mind Fog. Requires 75 mana invested. Psychic attack now has AoE of 3 feet. AoE independent of mana invested.

Level 15 familiar: Up to 100% chance to cause Mind Fog and chance to cause Stun. Requires 100 mana invested.

Level 20 familiar: Up to 100% chance to cause Mind Fog and increased chance to cause Stun. Requires 125 mana invested.

Level 25 familiar: Up to 100% chance to cause Mind Fog and greatly increased chance to cause Stun. Requires 150 mana invested. Psychic attack now has AoE of 6 feet. AoE independent of mana invested.

Level 30 familiar: Up to 100% chance to cause Mind Fog and Stun. Chance to cause Psi Crystallization. Requires 175 mana invested.

Richter read through the prompts, his heart beating faster in excitement as he devoured the words. There were more to read, but he needed to understand what these first ones meant first. The initial message was clear enough. His shots would be stronger! With a 35% bonus to damage he would be bringing the pain with every imbued arrow he fired. Some of the extra effects he didn’t understand though. His eyes lingered on “Mind Fog” and more information appeared.

Mind Fog: Your target becomes disorientated and cannot focus on the task at hand. The target will randomly act. Actions include but are not limited to attacking you, attacking others around the him, fleeing, or simply do nothing.

Well that’s clear enough, Richter though. Not too different from a standard Confusion spell that was in every RPG since the beginning of time. It was a staple of gaming and, in his opinion, had always been underrated. Turning an enemy’s strength against them was a good way to win a war. It wasn’t as good as mind control, but it looked like his psychic attacks had an AoE now. If he hit a cluster of enemies, it was a good bet at least one or two would start attacking the others. Besides, he thought with a smile, I’m a lucky sonofabitch!

Richter’s eyes moved to “Stun.”

Stun: Target is rendered senseless. In effect, he is stunned.

Well, ask a stupid question, Richter thought. The real question he had was about the last effect. His eyes widened as he read the description.

Psi Crystallization: A successful attack using this ability will concentrate the psychic energy in the target and crystalize it as a floating gem for a short time. This gem is insubstantial and cannot be affected except by psychic energy or strong magic. It will make the target more susceptible to psychic attacks. If the target dies while the gem is present, it will crystalize and can be claimed as loot. These crystals can have… interesting effects if used by psychic creatures.

Interesting effects? Gahhhh. Why couldn’t it be more clear? More importantly, why couldn’t he have one now? Whatever. He wanted one!

There was one more prompt waiting for him to examine.

Know This! Your connection with your familiar has deepened through investing in Psi Bond. By giving your familiar the ability to better know herself, you have, in turn, increased your own power. Never forget, the only thing that makes the journey worthwhile is each other. All psychic effects from Imbue Arrow are increased in likelihood and power by the depth of your Psi Bond as well as her level. Factoring in your familiar’s Psi Bond level 5 and personal level of 35, add 17.5% to the chances of Mind Fog, Stun or Psi Crystallization occurring when you use Enhanced Imbue Arrow.

And the hits just keep coming, Richter thought with jubilation. He let Alma know about everything that had just happened and she agreed with him. She wanted a psi crystal immediately. The fact that the higher-level effects were dependent on how much mana he invested meant the skill was limited somewhat, but again, the new AoE should make up for it. He did some quick calculations.

At subskill level one, his Enhance Imbued Arrow subskill allowed him to invest twenty points of mana per second. Every level that he had gained now apparently let him imbue the arrow 10% faster. Since he was at level seventeen, he should be able to place more than fifty mana into his shots per second! The sprites had always been powerful allies, but Enhanced Imbue Arrow made the meidon sprites a force of to be reckoned with! It also meant they would burn through mana faster than penicillin during frat week. Richter sighed, there were always checks and balances

He was about to walk away when he considered one more thing. A quick casting later, he had summoned a mist worker. Richter sent it to stand by the cliff face. With a short, “Sorry, bud,” he drew a specific arrow from his quiver and began to imbue it. A gold aura surrounded both the shaft and the enchanted arrowhead.

“What are you doing?” Sion shouted in alarm. The first thing all sprites learned was not to imbue already enchanted arrows. The results could be explosive.

Richter ignored him. Faster than ever before, black swirls began to flow over the golden aura. Two seconds later, the swirls moved so fast that they stabilized into a barbershop pole appearance. Meanwhile, the fine white and blue line of energy began to crackle around the imbued arrow faster and faster, a mini-lightning storm around his weapon. He continued to pour mana into his arrow and a smile made its way onto his face. There was no instability.

Sion had backed away, but seeing Richter in complete control, he just watched with a shocked expression on his face. Fifty, one hundred, one hundred fifty… the chaos seed kept pouring mana into his arrow. He didn’t start feeling the instability until he had invested five hundred mana into the shot! The aura around his arrow had transitioned to a state he had never seen before. The two colors had split completely like oil and water, each occupying a longitudinal half of the aura. The intensities of both ebbed and flowed as if they battled one another. Holding that much power in his hands sent a giddy feeling of jubilation through him. Nearly emptying his mana pool also made him feel as if he was going to faint. Before he completely lost control, he released.

A moment later, Richter was glad the mist worker was twenty yards away.

The explosive boom when the arrow impacted was like the loudest crack of thunder he had ever heard. The mist worker’s body shot backward, slamming against the white stone of the cliffs. The white and blue lightning extended out for five feet in all directions. Mist poured out of a large hole in the worker’s body and it crumpled to the ground.

Despite it just being an automaton, Richter dismissed it. Seeing his creation so damaged touched a chord. Once it’s body disappeared though, all he felt was excitement. A cry of worry rose from the from villagers that were only two hundred yards away. Sion stood by with his mouth open. Richter grinned sheepishly as his astonished friend and checked his combat log which was the whole reason the mist worker had had to be sacrificed.

Mist Worker suffers from Mind Fog.

Mist Worker is Stunned.

Mist Worker cannot be Psi Crystallized as it is a friendly summoned creature.

Mist Worker hit by Richter for varied damage. Damage Type(s): 32 Physical + 132 Magic (Force) + 5 Water Magic. Physical damage reduced by Physical Resistance (50%) to 16. Total Damage: 153.

“Oh yeah,” Richter breathed out softly. “Daddy likes.”

The damage his enhanced subskill could do was awesome. Of late, he had preferred close quarters combat which let him use his elementum blades. The stopping power of his short swords just couldn’t be denied. With this new improvement to his ranged abilities though, he might need to rethink his approach in future battles.

Richter walked over to the spot where the mist worker had been, hoping to retrieve his arrow, but it had been destroyed. He shrugged, knowing it had been a long shot. There was only a 20% chance of retrieving special arrows at his current rank of initiate in Archery, and that was in the best of cases. The explosive power of his imbued shots would most likely always destroy any missile. Besides, that wasn’t the point. His new subskill let him combine imbued shots with enchanted arrows!

Sion was still watching him with wide eyes. “How did you know that would work? All that mana could have backfired into your face.”

“That’s true,” Richter admitted, “but we need every edge we can get for this fight that’s coming. Besides, that was just step one.”

“Step one,” Sion asked confused. “What is step two?”

“Wellll,” Richter said pulling another enchanted arrow out of his quiver and offering it to Sion. “Depending on how you look at it, step two is actually the easy part.”

The sprite took the arrow with a curse and seriously considered using it on his friend.





CHAPTER 17 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Ultimately, Sion agreed to try. Richter initially tried to convince him by appealing to his honor and duty. “Do you really want the meidon sprites to have to fight hundreds of goblins without the best weapons they could have? We have to be sure that it’s not a fluke.” When that didn’t work, he went with the tried and true. “Don’t be such a pussy!”

Though scientists have never been able to properly explain why it worked, the ‘Don’t be a pussy’ had always been logic’s trump card. It had never let Richter down before and it didn’t this time either.

Snarling, Sion took the ice arrow and imbued it with his entire mana pool. It streaked like a blue comet towards the cliff face and detonated with an ear-ringing BOOM. A smear of ice was left on the cliff face, but more importantly, it didn’t blow up in the sprite’s face. The meidon had been sure Richter was finally going to be the death of him. After it turned out well though, he threw a fist into the air and gave a loud, “Wooohooo!”

Richter laughed and clapped his friend on the back. He told Sion to let the other meidon sprites know about this potential game changer, then the chaos seed looked around. Evening was approaching and dusk was soon to follow. It would be time to leave soon. Terrod and Caulder should be getting his fighters together even now. The rest of the villagers were now making their way up to the meadow to shelter for the night.

He was about to head back down to the Forge to enchant more arrowheads for the sprites when Hisako stopped.

“Are you ready for what is about to come?” she asked. The question wasn’t a challenge. It also wasn’t meant to pump him up, like teammates did before a big game. The Hearth Mother asked it quietly, as an invitation to listen. She understood the pressure of leadership. Hisako knew what it meant to send warriors to die. The Hearth Mother knew what thoughts were roiling beneath his surface.

Richter looked back at her, his jubilation from his new subskill fading. He understood what she was talking about without further clarification and he appreciated what she was doing. She was right. He realized that one of the reasons he had been going nonstop since waking up was so that he wouldn’t think about exactly what she was now bringing to his mind. The truth was, not all of his people would be coming back. Risking his own life was easy, but there would be widows and orphans after today, and all because he decided to involve them in affairs beyond the borders of his domain. Did he really have the right to send his people to war? Should he just keep his people safe within the enchanted mists?

Hisako didn’t interrupt him as he thought it through. She could tell by looking at his face that her question had had the desired effect. Richter was finally facing the reality of the upcoming battle. It was no small skirmish. It was the entrance of his village into a war. Far better that he face the choice now, and go into battle fully committed… or not at all.

Richter’s mind was racing, so he did what he always did when faced with stressful times. He breathed. Closing his eyes, he regulated his breath, and by extension, his heartbeat. He breathed in, letting his lungs fill with air, stretching his chest to smooth out knotted muscles. He breathed out, envisioning the breath carrying away toxic thoughts. Inhale, exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Seven times he controlled his air and committed to this singular moment in time. With the seventh exhale, the emotions that had been flooding up from where he had pushed them down settled. The answer became clear.

He had not founded the village to hide away from the world. The Mist Village would be a force for good in The Land. Richter could not in good conscience leave innocent people to be sacrificed if he could do something about it. He could also admit that his motivations were not purely altruistic. The goblins had already shown that they could penetrate his defenses. So far only in low numbers and slowly, but what if they had more power? What if this Bloodstone could be used for exactly that purpose? What if a thousand green-skinned warriors showed up outside of his village gates? He shook his head. It could not be allowed. History had shown again and again that ignoring evil because it did not affect you was a short-sighted and often deadly mistake.

One of the most powerful memories Richter had was his father taking him to the Holocaust Museum as a child. The stories and images had been terrible for him at the young age of eight. Still, his father hadn’t hidden any of the truth. They had walked through the museum, seen the pictures and listened to the tales of horror.

His father hadn’t stressed the suffering of those who had passed, though the man had held him as he cried. His dad hadn’t stressed the evil men were capable of, though he had stood by him as his son was horrified. What Richter remembered more than anything else was his father reading a quote. It was written outside of the museum on a memorial, words immortalized on a block of grey stone.

First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out –

because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out –

because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out --

because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me – and there was no one left to speak for me.



Richter remembered standing there with his father as people walked by. His fingers had been so small inside of his father’s large, warm hand. Though more than a decade had passed, he still remembered the simple message that had been conveyed when his father finally spoke. Gentle, yet stern, apologetic, but someone how still commanding, his father had said, “Be better than the men that came before you.”

That charge had become a cornerstone of Richter’s personality. That was why he had fought bullies even if he was outnumbered. That was why he did charity work without ever telling anyone about it. It was why he believed the world could become a better place, not because of luck, but because of his own actions. It was important to do the right thing, and not for a reward, but because it was the right thing.

It was also important to realize that, sometimes, there was a cost. His jaw firmed. If the price to save his village and the majority of his people was blood, then it was a price he would pay. His lips fixed themselves into a snarl though, and he promised himself that the lion’s share of that particular bill would be paid by his enemies.

Hisako saw the fierceness of Richter’s visage and the steel in his gaze. She nodded firmly and said, “Very well. There are things you need to learn.”





CHAPTER 18 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





“Kneel down,” she told him. When he looked at her in question, she sighed loudly and said, “I cannot very well reach all the way to the top of your abnormally high head can I? Do you want to learn these spells or not? Why the gods felt the need to stretch people so tall when four feet is the perfect height, I will never know.”

Richter chuckled. He was thankful that she had dispelled the serious air. The chaos seed felt his neck loosen somewhat and the righteous anger that had been flaring inside of him eased itself to a low simmer. It was not gone, merely banked, ready to roar to life again when he needed it in battle. As he knelt down, some excitement found its way onto his face. He was going to learn new spells!

“Let us see how you have progressed,” Hisako said. She muttered a word of Power and a nimbus of gold light surrounded her right hand. She extended her hand until the light fell upon Richter. “Hmmm, you have advanced well, Lord Richter. You have reached the initiate rank in both Life and Earth magic. Still only level seven in Light magic, but impressive nonetheless.” She paused a moment, then added distastefully, “And I see that you have become a practitioner of Death magic.”

Richter coughed, “Ah, well yes. Uhhh…” Not having a good save, and doubting that his argument about how Death magic wasn’t all bad would work on a Life Master, he changed tacks. “I am glad you noticed how well I am progressing in Life and Earth. That is what happens when you have a high affinity and battle daily for months, I guess.” He plastered a fake smile on his face.

She fixed him with that same considering gaze that she had had the night before when they spoke about the Bloodstone. Richter thought she might start the conversation back up, especially in light of her clear distaste for Death magic, but she just shook her head and raised her glowing hand again. She began muttering to herself as she read off his spells, “Weak Slow Heal, Weak Life Aura, Weak Barkskin… You certainly have been able to able to gather a good range of spells, but they are all of the weak rank.” She smiled at Richter, “I could easily change that.”

She just kept smiling at him. It honestly started getting a little weird to Richter, so after a minute or two he asked, “Well, will you?”

Without losing the grin, she said, “Absolutely. I have told you before that such aid would come at a price, however.”

Richter’s lips wrinkled in a sour twist. He had no problem paying for new spells, but she could have mentioned it before he was kneeling in front of her. He was basically in the opposite of a power pose. The chaos seed had a sneaking suspicion that she had planned it that way. Still, there was nothing for it now. “Of course,” he said almost magnanimously, “what can I do to help my generous ally?”

Hisako rapped him on the head lightly, yet another reason she had wanted him kneeling, he was sure. “Do not be fresh. I have warned you about that before.” She fixed him with a pointed look until he mumbled something that sounded like ‘okay’ with perhaps a little something extra added at the end. It was apparently enough, though, because she continued, “Great battles loom ahead. Your settlement is young, but has great potential. It already has great resources in fact. I would ask that you help to outfit my warriors with enchanted weapons. I could not help but notice that you know a Life damage enchantment.” Her voice turned coy at the end.

“You couldn’t help but notice, huh?” Richter asked. He was really starting to get irritated that he was having to kneel while having this conversation. His knee was also starting to throb a bit, which didn’t help his mood. “What else did that spell tell you about me?” he asked suspiciously.

Her smile deepened, but she ignored his question, “If you would provide ten short swords, high steel or better, that were enchanted with Life damage, I would happily give you spells now that will help you greatly.”

You have received a Quest: Steel for Magic I. The Lady Hisako has asked you to provide ten short swords, high steel or better, enchanted with Life damage. Reward: Spells from Lady Hisako right now. Fail Condition: One month passing without delivery. Penalty for Failure: Loss of Personal and Village reputation with Hisako and the Sprites of the Hearth Tree respectively. Yes or No?

Richter blinked in surprise. He had honestly been expecting a larger ask. His mouth opened to agree, but then a thought occurred to him, “I would happily do this for you without anything in return.”

She tsked and shook her head at him, “You are really quite bad at haggling, Lord Richter. Being kind is one thing, but don’t be a fool. As a leader, you must negotiate for the benefit of your people.”

Richter nodded and looked chastened, as if that hadn’t already occurred to him. “You’re right, Lady Hisako. I do need to think of my people. You know,” he said raising one finger as if in inspiration, “it just occurred to me that we could make a more formal agreement. If I were to say, oh, I don’t know, agree to provide ten enchanted swords per month for the foreseeable future, you might send me some experienced craftsmen to help grow my village.”

Her eyes narrowed, and a crafty glint entered her eye, “One craftsman for ten swords sounds very agreeable.”

The chaos seed sighed regretfully, “Any sprite is worth a mountain of gold, I fully agree. Unfortunately, I do not believe that only one craftsman would free up enough workers to be able to meet such a large order of enchanted swords each month.”

“How, pray tell, does a builder, crafter or alchemist keep your smiths from working?” she asked.

“If I have learned one thing from your lessons about nature, it is that all things are connected,” Richter responded, bowing his head. “Either way, I do of course agree to provide you with ten enchanted Life swords.”

He had apparently overplayed his hand because he received another, harder, rap on the head. Hisako softened it with a laugh, though. Richter heard her mutter “Fresh” under her breath, but then she placed one hand on his head and the other on his chest. Power pulsed down her arms, and he knew!

Richter mind swelled from the sudden and almost simultaneous flood of information. He drew in a ragged breath and coughed as it came out. A tear formed in the corner of one eye. It wasn’t exactly pain, but more that his brain needed time to process of all of the new spells. He went down on all fours, and, for the next few seconds, it was all he could do not to tip over. Even the awesomeness of learning two shield spells and one of his old favorites, Weak Magic Missile, couldn’t make him rally. The chaos seed remained kneeling until his head stopped spinning.

When his breathing was under control, he looked up and saw Hisako looking at him. “I didn’t expect you to be quite so… generous with new spells,” he said.

She reached out and touched him lightly on the cheek with an open hand. Her voice was kind when she said, “Such is the bounty of being an ally of the Hearth Mother. Now that that is completed, however,” her voice grew deadly playful, “let us formalize our trade agreement.”

The two of them spoke for a quarter of an hour, battering lightly back and forth, but they agreed on terms easily enough. Richter hoped his negotiations with other heads of state would go as easily, but he had a feeling that the agreement was reached quickly because of the strong relationship between himself and the Hearth Mother. She even agreed to supply a certain amount of filled common soul stones each month, if he agreed to make the enchantments rank three or better. When they were done, they were both satisfied. He agreed to supply even more weapons each month, but got a great deal in response. Richter was rewarded with a series of notifications.

Quest Update: Steel for Magic I. You have accepted payment for ten swords enchanted with Life magic, high steel or better. Deliver the swords within one month or suffer major penalties!

Congratulations! You have created your first Trade Treaty with another settlement! The terms of this treaty cannot be cancelled for half a year, though it can be renegotiated at any time with the consent of both parties. Failure to fulfill the terms of a Trade Treaty can have SERIOUS consequences. Early delivery may be negotiated and looked upon favorably.

The Mist Village offers:

The Hearth Tree offers:



15 enchanted swords per month:

Material - High steel or better

Enchantment rank - 3 or better

Quality - Superb or better



Skilled craftsmen:

1 worker with Construction skill, Journeyman or higher

1 worker with Crafting skill, Journeyman or higher

1 worker with Farming skill, Journeyman or higher

1 worker with Bowmaking skill, Journeyman or higher

30 soul stones per month, filled with common souls or better





Before finalizing the treaty, Hisako warned him that her builder might not be completely effective in the village. Because Richter was a human, she thought his settlement might be considered “human.” Sprite buildings were often grown as much as built, so while her builder would be able to create buildings, the magical perks might not take hold. Richter thought about her words, but then remembered how his Limitless ability seemed to be bleeding into various facets of village life, research being the latest. He told the Hearth Mother that he wanted to give it a try. She just shrugged and acceded, but also reminded him that the treaty couldn’t be cancelled for half a year.

Richter felt like it was a chance worth taking. He also had something else on his mind, because, in addition to finally creating a trade treaty, he had received a new skill!

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Diplomacy. As the leader of a settlement, your words and deeds have the ability to affect hundreds. Perhaps one day, millions. Increase this skill to improve the regard other leaders have for you and your policies. Diplomacy can be advanced by representing your settlement in dealings with other settlements, factions, guilds or powerful figures as well as holding to other deals that you have already made. You may now earn diplomacy points. “Diplomacy is the art of telling people to go to hell in such a way that they ask for directions.”

Current Diplomacy Points (Mist Village→ Hearth Tree):0

Not even leveling made Richter as happy as gaining a new skill, and this one seemed like it could help his entire village! He was also eager to learn how Diplomacy points could be used. A moment later, a thought occurred to him, though. Did Hisako already have the Diplomacy skill? He had thought he was getting the better end of the deal, but now he was starting to wonder. His swords were Core forged after all… Richter narrowed his eyes at the Hearth Mother for a moment, but then just let it go. The truth was, the trade treaty would benefit them both. It was also a sign of just how far his relationship with the sprites had come.

Hisako had always been fair, but when they had first met, she had also almost sentenced him to death. Through his words and deeds, he had increased their relationship from neutral all the way up to ally. Richter was positive that neither the treaty nor the spells he had just received would have happened without their close bond. It was just another example of the unspoken laws of The Land exerting themselves in his daily life. Sometimes Richter felt resentful at having his actions unknowingly dictated by unseen forces, but then he realized it wasn’t too different than his life on Earth. In The Land, it was just more readily quantifiable.

He started to leave, but she put a hand on his elbow. Though she didn’t grab him, he still stopped moving and looked at her askance. Hisako pursed her lips before speaking, “As I was assessing you with my spell, I noticed something strange.”

“Speak freely,” Richter said.

“You may not know this, but the mana for your magic comes from an intangible reservoir within you. This is called your mana core.”

“I hadn’t heard it put in exactly those words,” Richter replied slowly, “but I do feel something inside me being harnessed when I cast spells.”

“Yes. You are feeling your mana being pulled from your core. A magical field permeates your entire body and the bodies of all living things. It is often called an aura. The magic can typically only be utilized once it coalesces in your core. Some call it a mana pool and some call it a reservoir. No matter what the term, it is the repository for your magic. When you increase your Intelligence, your mana core grows larger. It also makes the mana it holds more condensed. That is why increasing Intelligence makes spells slightly more powerful and harder for others to resist. When you increase your Willpower, you increase the refill rate of your core. Your entire magical field becomes more vibrant which makes it easier to harness usable magic. A secondary effect of strengthening your magical field is that it increases your general arcane resistance slightly. Are you following?” she asked.

Richter nodded. Nothing she was saying was terribly surprising, but it was still good to have a concrete understanding of the power he wielded. Seeing his eagerness to learn more, she continued, “One thing that we sprites do to our young magi is circulate this energy through their bodies, especially into their hands as most spells are focused there. Doing that reduces the risk of spell miscasts and makes the casting of higher level spells easier. What I saw when I was assessing you with my spell was that your mana pool is only loosely connected to the rest of your body. You have some channels that have formed by your spell casting or when you imbue arrows, but they are very inefficient. If you like, I could use my own magic field to manipulate yours. This is something I would not generally recommend, as it leaves both parties vulnerable. Because I regard you so highly, however, I am willing to do this.”

Once again, his relationship with Hisako seemed to be coming into play. Not really seeing a downside, he nodded. Seeing his assent, she raised both arms, but this time she just held her hands upright, palms flat. She motioned with her hands, and Richter did the same, placing his larger hands flat against her own.

Hisako, the Hearth Mother, would like to access your mana core. Do you wish to allow this? Yes or No? Alert! Doing this can allow the other party to cause you great and irreparable harm!

Well, she did warn him, Richter thought with a grimace. Still, if you can’t trust a sorceress that looks like a cross between a Scottish druid and a Japanese geisha, who can you trust? He chose “Yes.”

Hisako nodded, somehow aware that she had been granted access and said, “This might feel… a bit weird.” A strange tickling began in both of his hands and traveled down his arms and into his chest.

“That’s not so b-” was all he got about before pain slammed into his mind like a semi crushing an ice cream cone. All he knew was black.





CHAPTER 19 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





“Ow. Ow! Oooowwwww! What the fucked just happened? Who’s been kicking me in the head?” Richter shouted as he regained consciousness a few seconds later. It had felt like she had ripped his asshole up through his body. His arms throbbed as if he had tried to grab lightning and his head felt like he had been drinking shitty vodka all night.

“You’re welcome,” she said with a grin. “Before you complain any further, I think you’ll find a prompt waiting for you.”

Glaring daggers at the masochistic Master, he checked his notifications.

Congratulations! You have learned the skill: Mana Manipulation. There is more to manipulating the arcane mysteries than words and gestures. The Hearth Mother has aligned your mana field to allow for easier casting of spells and decreased possibility of misfires. Learning this skill has unlocked the basic attack spell of all casters.

Congratulations! You have learned the spell: Manifest Mana. This spell has no specific affinity for any type of magic. Instead, the power and effects of this spell are determined by the skill level of Mana Manipulation. Successful casting of this spell makes your mana tangible in the physical world. At skill level one, the cost is 100 mana and, if thrown at an attacker, will cause 1 point of magical force damage. This is an unaligned spell, level 1. Cost: variable. Duration: Instant. Range: variable. Cast Time: variable. Cooldown: N/A.

“I hope there is more coming that that!” Richter exclaimed. “I mean I appreciate all the previous spells, but this Mana Attack is straight garbage. It certainly wasn’t worth you ripping my taint through my mouth!”

“Shush,” Hisako admonished him. “I do not know what your ‘taint’ is, but I believe I can guess. If you reference it again in my presence, I will acquaint you with some of my other spells.” ‘Acquaint’ had a suitably ominous undertone, so Richter apologized despite the continual throbbing in his arms and head. Mollified, she continued, “Had you undergone some type of formal training, anywhere in The Land, you would have learned this spell first. While the damage is laughable initially, as you level your Mana Manipulation skill it grows. You are missing the main point, however. Have you noticed the somatic component of this spell?”

Richter had managed to get into a sitting position. He was still in a bad mood, but when he glared at the bossy woman and saw her glare right back, he once again decided to appease the powerful little woman. He searched the in-depth knowledge of the spell that he suddenly had access to. The hours he had spent scribing spellbooks had greatly increased his conceptual understanding of magic. The best way he had come up with explaining it was that knowing a spell was like knowing a phone number. You could call it on a cell, no problem, but it didn’t mean you understood how the sound waves of your voice converted to electrical energy and then were transmitted as radio waves. Richter was starting to understand the inner mechanisms of spell work. That was why he was absolutely shocked when he saw that Manifest Mana was missing something that every other spell he knew required. Namely, the need for gestures.

Curious now, he accessed the spell. His mana pool dropped by one hundred points. Richter felt a slight tug from his center, the place he now knew was his mana core, and a pea-sized mote of mana appeared in front of him. It was the same rich blue as the mana bar on his interface. Hisako’s explanation of his mana condensing also answered a question he had had in the back of his mind for a while. When he improved his Intelligence, the blue bar of his mana deepened to a brighter hue. The same was true for his Constitution and Endurance which deepened the colors of his health and stamina bars respectively. The red of his health bar was by far the most vibrant, which made sense because Constitution was his highest stat.

Richter stared in fascination at the bright blue sphere floating in front of him. Grabbing it, the tangible magic was malleable, but could only be compressed so far. What it reminded Richter off was squeezing a gummy bear. Not the crappy greasy ones, but the good German ones. ‘Go Haribo or go home’ as he used to say. After about a minute, it just disappeared. “Where did it go?”

“As I said, at skill level one, the spell is extremely limited,” Hisako replied. “Cast it again and, this time, will it to fire at that rock.”

Once again, Richter cast Manifest Mana and marveled at the fact that he didn’t have to move his hands to complete the spell. The blue pea also appeared instantly. Even his spells with one second cast times didn’t manifest as quickly. He willed it to fly at the cliff face. The small blue ball shot away and hit the rock, disappearing without a trace.

“It may not be impressive, but the spell will grow in power,” Hisako repeated. “What you need to do is concentrate on consciously pulling mana from your field into your core. It will feel as if nothing is happening at first, but the more you practice, the more you will be aware of your magical field. Once you can feel it, start trying to pull mana from individual parts of your body. By doing this, you will increase the mana pathways in your body. Once you level Mana Manipulation, Manifest Mana becomes more versatile,” Hisako said with a smile.

Suddenly, in front of her three small birds appeared. They all opened their mouths and sang. The clarity of their voices was incredible and brought a peace to Richter’s heart. The pixie children swarmed around them, seeing a new toy and raised their voices as well. For a few minutes, the impromptu symphony filled the air, until Hisako waved her hand and the birds disappeared. The pixie children let out a universal “Awwww,” and dispersed, but their song had already had an effect.

You have heard: Playful Song of the Celestial Pixie. The celestial pixies have celebrated their joy of life and all that it brings. You have been lucky enough to hear this song. You will be much less susceptible to negative emotional influences because of this reminder of the beauty in the world around you. +10% defense against negative emotional effects for the next 24 hours.

Richter looked at Hisako with a genuine and unreserved smile, which she returned.

“Did you know that would happen when you summoned your birds?” he asked in wonder.

She looked at him smugly and said, “Of course I did.”

Richter chuckled at her cockiness. There was no doubt where Sion got his personality from. The chaos seed looked at all of the new spells he had learned, and joy filled his heart anew. Some of them were even minor in power! From the Lore books he had been reading he knew that most spells were assigned a strength of weak, minor, average, enhanced, potent, superior, powerful, grand and supreme. Up to this point, all of his spells had been weak. Though they were effective, they were limited in strength. She had just given him higher ranked magic! As he reviewed the spells, his mind turned to the practical. “So, which of these summoning spells should I use against the goblins?”

Hisako looked at him confused, “What do you mean?”

“I mean when we go into battle, which of these summoned creatures would work best against them? I have been using my weak saproling, but if this spider is better, I’ll use that. I just wish I could summon more than one at once.”

She looked at him quizzically again, “You can use more than one summoned creature at once, Lord Richter.”

“What?” Of all of the things that had happened and that he had learned in his conversation with the Hearth Mother, this seemed like the most earth-shattering. “But I tried! When I try to summon a second saproling, the first one always disappears.”

Hisako opened her mouth to answer, left it open for a moment, then closed it. She shook her head as if she was embarrassed for him. He half expected her to say, ‘Oh honey, you’re so pretty,’ when she finally spoke to him. Thankfully, she had a bit more grace.

“You are telling me that you tried to summon a creature that you had already summoned?” she asked delicately.

“Yes,” Richter said slowly and with a bit of chagrin. From the way that she had phrased it, he was pretty sure where she was going with this.

“And when you tried to summon that one creature… a second time… with the same spell… you were surprised that there was still only one creature?”

Richter hung his head, and said forlornly, “Yes.”

“Yesss,” she said slowly and sadly, dragging the word out.

Richter picked his head up suddenly and tried to protest, “But I thought-”

He stopped when she just closed her eyes and started shaking her head with pursed lips. The message was clear, ‘Just don’t.’

The chaos seed sighed deeply. His arms, chest, and head still ached something fierce. It was embarrassing to continue sitting in front of the Hearth Mother, but he didn’t quite feel up to rising yet. Richter decided to make the best of a bad situation. Better to admit ignorance and learn than celebrate your own stupidity, “So you’re saying I can conjure as many creatures as I have spells so long as I don’t run out of mana?”

“Not exactly,” she admitted. “I am glad that you are asking questions now, though, rather than just making assumptions. You know what you do when you assume, right?”

“Yeah, yeah,” Richter said. “You make and ‘ass’ out of ‘u’ and ‘me.’”

“No,” Hisako replied dismissively as if his answer was nonsense. He realized that his response was utter nonsense seeing as how that joke only worked in English. “Assumptions create barriers in your own mind. By taking short cuts in logic, you wall yourself off from true enlightenment.”

Richter had to admit, what she said sounded much better.

*What she said sounded a lot better,* Alma interjected.

*Stay out of this,* he thought to his familiar in irritation. It didn’t matter that she was echoing his own sentiments. Nobody liked a side seat conversationalist.

“Well how does it work?” he asked.

“The number of creatures that you can summon is based on multiple factors. Your Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom, skill in the spell school, and also the creature’s level, properties and disposition all determine how easily you can control it. Obviously, it is easier to summon several docile creatures at the same time, than it would be to summon several hostile creatures with a strong will. There are even more factors which come into play in certain circumstances. Those foolish enough to summon demons, for instance, will always need to engage in a contest of wills to keep the creatures under their control. A summoning pentagram is also usually recommended.”

“So how do I know how many creatures I can control safely?” Richter asked.

“Summoning magic is dangerous,” Hisako answered. “The more powerful the creature, the greater the risk of losing control. If that occurs, you lose the ability to banish the creature without destroying it, though it will still vanish once the spell duration elapses. Most of the time anyway. As far as how many creatures you can safely control, you will need to discover that for yourself.

If you were a Mage, there is a Talent that helps with this, but for you, it will have to be trial and error. Just remember, the more you summon, the more likely you will lose control of some or all of them. I will tell you that summoning creatures from different spell schools, however, greatly decreases the chances that you will lose control, as opposed to summoning multiple Earth creatures for instance.

You must also be cognizant of the natural enmity of the creatures you summon. It would be unwise to summon both a fire drake and an ice wurm, for instance. Both creatures are naturally aggressive and, being from opposing Elements, it increases the chance that their innate enmity might overwhelm your control. Life creatures, on the other hand are typically more congenial. Even if you lost control, it is unlikely they would attack you, so much as not obey you. None of what I am telling you is an absolute, however. Remember the angel I summoned to fight off the bugbears. He is a creature of Life, but would still strike your head from your shoulders if you summoned him for reasons that went against his nature. Always remember that summoning sentients should not be done lightly.”

Richter’s head was spinning from all the information, and he didn’t actually feel closer to a useful understanding yet, but Hisako didn’t pause, “Another exception to the summoning rule seems to be animation, or summoning a formless creature to move an otherwise inanimate husk. Powerful necromancers have been known to control scores of zombies and skeletons, just as Earth magi can animate multiple golems if their bodies are pre-made from clay or stone.

“In these cases, while you are still summoning a spirit, you are not summoning a creature that can exist independently in The Land. I have heard it explained that these creatures are thankful for being given form and so fight their master’s control much less. Personally, I believe that to all be foolish talk, but still, it is said. There is much more to learn about summoning magic, but for someone at your level, without taking other factors into consideration, it should be sufficient.”

“I think I got it,” Richter said, despite that being far from the truth. If he was following correctly, it meant he could summon the chokespore arachnid and saproling at the same time, but it might not be as good of an idea as summoning creatures from varying, but non-opposing spell schools. The Ring of Dominant Will he had taken from the Witch Doctor was starting to look a great deal more attractive.

Richter decided not to mess with his ring configuration on the eve of battle, though. Most of what they were talking about was academic up to this point anyway, seeing as how he only had enough mana to summon three, maybe four creatures at once, and that would tap him out completely. Mana headaches were no picnic. Still, thinking about what she had said, Richter asked, “What ‘other factors’ could increase my ability to control more creatures?”

She sighed, “Summoning magic is a branch of the arcane that can be studied for an entire lifetime, and still there would be more to learn. Your question is too broad to answer right now, but one example would be magi who Specialize as a Conjuror. As I have already told you, there are Mage Talents that can augment summoning spells as well. I am sure there are even more. After all, oci no suit nima, nino oci sui.”

Richter translated it as, “The Land is all magic, all magic is The Land.”

Clearly done with the conversation, she started walking away, but he had a final question, “What should I do if I summon a powerful creature that slips my control?”

She didn’t stop walking, but just shrugged and called over her shoulder, “Run, and hope that it is slower than you.”

With that last bit of helpful advice, she walked away, calling over her shoulder that they should leave within the hour. Richter stood there for a few more moments wondering if his power would ever take control of itself and become a danger to him. Ultimately, he realized that it didn’t matter because he would never stop wanting more.





CHAPTER 20 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





An hour later, the battle host was assembled. Hisako had roughly two hundred and fifty sprites at her command. The forces Richter was committing included over seventy meidon sprites and nearly eighty guardsmen. That included twenty Life magi, or biomancers, as they had started calling themselves and twenty-eight aeromancers. He also brought another ten biomancers that didn’t serve in the guard, as support staff. All of his troops were outfitted with the best he could provide. Each member of the war party also imbibed a Potion of Clarity, increasing any experience they gained by 25% for the next twenty-four hours.

The former wood sprites wore the same green armor that Richter wore, resized by the Hearth Mother to fit their larger frames. The forest sprites that had undergone the meidon were wearing the best leather armor the Forge of Heavens had available. Most of it was enchanted to increase its defense by +3 or +4. His guardsmen wore enchanted mail or leather and basically fell into three categories of armaments: sword and shield; mace and shield; or two-handed spear.

Richter left organizing the troops to Terrod, Caulder, and Sion. He was otherwise occupied with Yoshi. In his typically brusque manner, the sword adept walked up to him and gave an order, “Hold still. I need to assess your War Leader skill.”

A white light seemed to turn on behind the half-sprite’s eyes as he looked at Richter. Knowing how dangerous the sword adept was, having him scrutinize you with glowing, white, demon eyes was more than just a little disconcerting. Richter was happy when the adept’s eyes went back to normal a moment later.

“You bought the badge, Sphere of Influence I, so your total SoI should be two hundred yards,” Yoshi said. It was clear he was talking to himself more than to Richter. “You also bought four ranks in forest movement. Hmmm.” He actually addressed the chaos seed for the first time, “I am actually impressed at your choice. Most human war leaders think short term and only see the value of brute force. I am surprised that you did not invest all of your points into melee attack and defense.”

Richter blinked, completely surprised. Was it possible that Yoshi was giving him a compliment? A smile started to cross his face.

“That being said, you are an absolute fool for not investing any points into attack or defense,” Yoshi continued.

The smile died. Well, that didn’t take long, he thought sourly.

Yoshi, looked at him for a moment, “If you ride in the center of the warband, your SoI might be large enough to cover the entire party. That would take a level of discipline, and a preciseness of movement, that I doubt your people are capable of, however.” He shook his head, “It would have been helpful if you had enough War points to purchase Sphere of Influence II. You should really take your point acquisition more seriously.” The adept looked at him judgingly.

“I did! You did see that I have four ranks in forest movement speed, right?” Richter said, irritated.

Yoshi just hmpf’d, “I will admit, investing in forest travel is beneficial. If you had enough War points, I would have you buy the next rank.”

“These are my points, you know,” Richter said in irritation.

Yoshi looked back at him, and his eyes began to glow again.

Asshole is doing it on purpose, Richter realized. He thinks he can bully me! Yoshi kept staring at him for another minute, which Richter thought was complete overkill.

“What the hell is that?” he finally asked. “The glowy eye thing.”

Yoshi glared a second longer before his eyes relaxed to normal, “It is a badge you can purchase once you become a journeyman in War Leader.” From experience, Richter knew he wouldn’t get much more out of the swordsman than that.

The adept lowered his voices and stepped closer, “Your men and women have most likely never been in a large battle. I would guess that you have not either.” Richter nodded. He really hoped Yoshi wasn’t about to mock him again. After the half-sprite spoke again, he wished the half-sprite’s words were only mocking. Deadly serious, Yoshi look Richter in the eye, “War is not pretty. It is not tidy. It is horrible and bloody. By nightfall tomorrow, all that will be left of some of us is meat. I know that investing in defense will only help those that are in your war party, but it is better than nothing. I will leave to you the decision of how to distribute your points. I have final preparations to make.”

Yoshi walked off to speak to some of the other sprites, leaving Richter to ponder his options.

He had three hundred and one points left. The question was, what to do with them. He agreed with Yoshi that keeping his people alive needed to be his top priority. He could increase their defense. From what he had seen, goblins were mainly melee fighters. If he put all of his eggs in one basket, he should be able to purchase five ranks in melee defense. It would cost almost all of his War points, but the armor his people wore would be 25% stronger. It could definitely mean the difference between life and death.

The main downside that he could see was that increasing Melee Defense was a closed badge. It would only affect the people he put directly into his war party. At his initiate rank in the skill, that was only ten people. He had hundreds to help. Melee Attack, Ranged Attack, and Ranged Defense all had the same problem.

What he needed was a way to help everyone in the band. Richter’s eyes fell on a badge he had never used before, Favored Enemy. It added a generous 10% to attack and defense across the board. It also increased magical attack power by 6% for all spells as well. Finally, it provided 4% spell defense. At least for the eight spell schools that comprised the Basic Elements: Life, Death, Light, Dark, Water, Fire, Air and Earth. Most importantly, it was an open badge, so it would affect everyone in his SoI. He had never really considered it, though, because of the large variability of monsters he faced on a daily basis. Those bonuses would only work against one type of enemy. The two hundred and fifty point cost was also nothing to sneeze at. For the upcoming battle, however, it might be just the thing.

Richter was not one to waste time second guessing. He spent the War points. Before he could secure the badge, though, a list of enemies appeared before him. He would have to choose his favored enemy at the time of purchase. Animals, Reptile Beasts, Amphibian Beasts, Mammalian Beasts, Hybrids, Living Dead… The list kept going and was amazingly specific. He thought all the animals would be grouped together, but apparently, the magical ones were called ‘Beasts.’ Apparently, to get so many bonuses at once, he would have to be quite specific. He kept going through the list, marveling at the number of monsters he had encountered. The words were in plain, common script. Near the bottom of the list were the names of sentient races he had fought. Richter scanned through it until he found Goblin, and selected it.

Congratulations! You have purchased Favored Enemy I and have chosen Goblin.

Total War Points Remaining: 51.

A new line appeared on his badge table, Favored Enemy II (Goblin). The second rank cost five hundred points. The original badge was still there as well in case he wanted to choose another favored enemy. It would be expensive though, and he could only have one per war party formation. Richter bought Magical Strength II (Life) as well, hoping that the boost in spell power might help his biomancers heal injured troops.

Total War Points Remaining: 1.

He walked over to Yoshi. The sword adept’s eyes glowed white again before he nodded and said, “Good. We leave in half an hour.”

Richter rolled his eyes. Thanks, coach. He looked around at his forces and the other villagers that had gathered to wish them well. He wanted the noncombatants to be safe up in the meadow by the time they left, but Randolphus had told him it would be a horrible idea to try and force the point. Husbands and wives were saying goodbye for perhaps the last time. Children played, wept, or stood by stoically depending on their age and their understanding of what was happening.

A cloud of multicolored pixies hovered in the air as well. There had been a loud, and mostly cute, outcry from the pixie children when they heard that they could not join the battle. More than ninety tiny voices had tried to explain to “Unca Wichter” that it really wasn’t his choice. They simply had to go with their meitu’meidons. The chaos seed had taken it in good stride at first, but as they continued to buzz around him complaining and persuading, he had to speak firmly to them. Ultimately, he had to make it an order. Now they flew above, sticking their tongues out at him when they thought he wasn’t looking.

He put the children out of his mind. It became easier when he saw a familiar face walk up. Beyan made a beeline towards him with a creature trailing behind him. Richter easily recognized it, seeing as how he had killed it before. It was the decaemur knight, Jurgen.

Richter had seen it following the arcane gnome around several times over the past few weeks. Initially, it had made him tense every time he had seen it, but two things brought him ease. One, to Beyan’s dismay, the bonding of the knight’s body and the weak Death spirit he had placed inside of it had caused some unintended effects. The knight had lost levels.

When Richter had initially fought the undead, it had been a level thirty-seven monster. The knight had been able to summon undead minions or fight hand to hand with deadly effect. When Beyan had summoned a level three Death creature to animate the body, he had indeed been successful at tying the Death spirit to the body. As a result of the level differential, however, the knight’s level had dropped to twenty-seven. Even though it had upset Beyan to no end, Richter had felt a bit calmer knowing the undead killing machine was a bit less of a threat if things went tits up.

The other thing that made it less dangerous was that the knight’s Intelligence and Wisdom had dropped severely as well. Beyan had also been bothered by that, but not surprised. The spell he used to animate the corpse, Summon Weak Zombie, apparently never preserved the magical abilities of the target. Again, Richter was somewhat relieved. If the knight went feral, fighting it would be hard enough without it summoning minions. True, it made the knight less effective in battle when fighting for him, but Richter still felt better.

Besides, the knight was still deadly. It had preserved much of its combat potential and Strength. Not to mention the fact that its undead nature would let it ignore pain in battle. Richter hadn’t been sure that Beyan would come on the attack, but after using Analyze on the knight, he was glad the gnome had brought his pet.

Name: Reclaimed Decaemur Knight Disposition: Angry

This Decaemur Knight has been reclaimed from death a second time by the Death mage, Beyan. The union of the knight’s body and a weak Death creature, it has lost its magical abilities but remains a deadly foe in the martial realm.

Level: 28

Health: 430Mana: 20Stamina: 420

Strength: 39

Agility: 28

Dexterity: 27

Constitution: 43

Endurance: 42

Luck: 12





The knight was wearing high steel armor and carried a huge broadsword made of the same metal. Its original armor had given a bonus to casting Death magic. When it was clear that the reclaimed undead couldn’t cast spells anymore, the armor was sacrificed to the Forge. Three items, the helmet, boots, and greaves, had to be sacrificed, but the Forge learned the enchantment. Thankfully, the enchantment didn’t come with the requirement that only undead could use it.

Alma had never warmed to the undead creature. The dragonling hissed at it from her perch on Richter’s shoulder when Beyan walked up.

The gnome frowned, “It would please me if you would restrain your familiar from attacking my knight, Lord Richter.”

The chaos seed chuckled, “What are you worried about? That thing is huge. Alma is the size of a cat.” That statement got him an annoyed look from the dragonling.

“Then that is a very large cat,” Beyan responded.

“That’s what she said,” Sion quipped.

Richter rolled his eyes at his friend, but the sprite continued undaunted, “Nice to see you Beyan. What are you doing here? You do know that we are heading to battle, correct? Are you and your girlfriend there looking for a fight?” The chaos seed didn’t know why his friend always liked fucking with the Death mage, but since he usually thought it was pretty funny, he let it go.

Beyan seemed like he was in a good mood and gave as good as he got, “I would ask where your girlfriends are, but I see them at the end of your arms. All ten of them.” The gnome locked eyes with Sion, clearly ready for more.

Sion sniffed, and said, “Not bad.” Then he started walking away.

“Next time, you can just say ‘Respect’ at the end,” Richter called after him.

The sprite stopped and thought about it. Then he threw up a peace sign, something else he had learned from Richter, before saying, “Respect,” and continuing to walk off.

Chuckling slightly at his friend’s antics, the chaos seed addressed the Death mage. “Looks like you’re feeling good,” he said. “What happened? Did you eat your Wheaties?”

Beyan looked at him confused, “No. I did not eat wheat. I did, however, reach level eleven in Death magic! Only two more levels before I can animate skeletons.”

Richter understood his excitement. The Death mage had found the bones of some rare monster and was just itching to reanimate it.

“Are you sure you want to come for this fight?” Richter asked the gnome. “I am happy to have your strength and the sword of your pet, but you are risking your life.”

“I am not afraid,” Beyan said, offended.

“I am not saying you are. I would not blame you if you were. The truth is, I am afraid of what is coming. There is no shame in fearing battle. What I am trying to say is that I know you spent a lifetime hiding your powers. Today, you must do the opposite. You will have to unleash what you have kept secreted away. What I need is for you to embrace your power. What I need is a necromancer.”

Beyan pulled himself up to his full four feet of height. The man’s face was a bit pudgy and his head was bald, but Richter did not doubt his sincerity when he said, “You have one.”

Richter extended his arm and Beyan did the same. The two men clasped wrists, united in purpose. As they released their grip, Yoshi raised his voice to address the whole warband.

“Move out.”





CHAPTER 21 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Yoshi formed a war party, including Richter within it. The sword adept’s Sphere of Influence was more than up to the task of including the hundreds of fighters, seeing as how it extended thousands of yards. One of the badges the fighter had invested in apparently increased the Fighting Spirit of any friendlies inside of his SoI. No matter how the day would play out, everyone had steel in their gaze as they marched.

Terrod had arranged the Mist Village forces to have the melee fighters on the periphery as they moved. Despite the fact that they had to travel dozens of miles until they reached the goblin encampment, it didn’t mean that danger was far away. They were going through the forest as night was falling. In Richter’s experience, animals and monsters alike had a survival instinct so they should avoid a party as large as his, but there were exceptions. The undead especially didn’t seem to care if they lived or died. Which basically made sense.

Richter had been going to form his war party, but Yoshi convinced him to wait. The adept’s reasoning was simple. If Richter was brought into Yoshi’s war party, then he could have all of the benefits without actually forming his own party, something that he could only do once every twenty-four hours. The reasoning was that if the higher ranked war leader were to fall in battle, his subordinates could reform their own war parties afterward.

Yoshi also told him that different ranks of war leaders had different names. A novice was called a Strike Leader and an initiate, like Richter, was a Battle Sergeant. After that, the ranks were Battle Captain, Battle Leader, War Leader, and masters were Battle Lords.

Richter was shocked to learn that Yoshi, as a Battle Leader, had a baseline war party size of one thousand fighters! Everyone in the battle group came under the umbrella of the adept’s War Leader skill and benefited from all of the badges and promotions that went with it. Richter was placed in the center of the group to maximize coverage of this Sphere of Influence, and they took off.

Hisako and some of the other sprites had summoned their strike stags again, but Richter remained on the ground. He felt an instinctive need to remain on the same level as his people. As he walked, he tried to speak with as many of his people as possible. Always flanked by Sion, and with Alma flying overhead, his presence had a clear, calming effect on his people. It had been easy to forget as he dealt with his doubts and stresses that the men and women under his command felt the same fears. Yoshi was right. Many of them had never been in battle before. Seeing their lord walking around with an easy smile helped to put them at ease. Even the large form of the shale adder, slithering through the underbrush, was looked at fondly by his people. The snake had been accepted as just another show of their lord’s power.

Hours passed, and miles were consumed. Yoshi led the way, guided by a static copy of Richter’s map that one of the Scholars had made. As they traveled, Richter kept trying to “feel” his mana field like Hisako had told him to, but had no success. Despite being frustrated, he kept at it. He also occupied his time reviewing his new spells: Minor Slow Heal, Weak Mend Bone, Summon Weak Gold Fox, Weak Static Life Shield, Summon Minor Chokespore Arachnid, Minor Chitin Carapace, Weak Static Earth Shield, Weak Mirror Image and Weak Magic Missiles.

It was amazing how generous the Hearth Mother had been. Admittedly, he had been directly responsible for bringing back the pixie race, and thereby allowing the sprites to fulfill their destiny for the first time in millennia. He had also acted to merge the disparate sprite races back into their true bloodline, and thereby ends countless years of division and strife, but still, she had really hooked him up!

The summoning spells were awesome. His saproling, while useful, got its ass kicked on a regular basis. He had to hope that the chokespore arachnid would be able to pack a bigger punch. The improved healing spell would also come in handy. His 50% boost to Life magic meant that the spell was three times as strong as his Weak Slow Heal. His Life Mastery also meant that Alma could cast the spell, which could literally mean the difference between life and death.

The other spells were great too, and if he was being honest with himself, it was the shield spells that excited him the most. The biggest problems he had had with battles in the past were against mages that could utilize shields. It basically gave the casters carte blanche to attack without fear of retaliation. The seconds it took to take the shield down could let them fry you or freeze your internal organs. It was more than awesome that he could enjoy that benefit himself now.

The shields were also ‘static.’ Hisako had explained that it meant they had a fixed number of health points. Once those points were depleted, the shield was gone. The other broad category was apparently called ‘active.’ It included shields that you could continually feed magic into. It made for a much stronger shield apparently, but also carried a high risk of spell backfire if it did collapse. In a battle, that senseless state was as good as a death sentence. Richter was more than happy with his static shield.

Reading the description of the spell was also illuminating. The shields were great to have, but they seemed to have a serious weakness. The lower level ones anyway. The barriers would not stop attacks based on their own type of magic. It meant that if he came up against an Earth-based shield in the future, then his acid sphere and sonic attack spells should still be able to take the guy out. Even better, summoned creatures of that type of magic should still be lethal! He realized that this might be the biggest advantage for him knowing spells in all eight of the basic elements. His broad spell base would come in handy for his own attack spells. He should have enough Earth spells, for instance, to still be deadly even inside of his protective shield.

One thing that he hadn’t expected was that these minor rank spells would be so much more expensive. He had thought that his five hundred points of mana were more than adequate. If these costs were representative of the initiate level spells, then he was woefully underprepared for a magical battle. It was a good thing that he had his short swords. What was that old saying? Blades never run out.

Besides the cost, the only real downside he could see was that many of the spells were level ten. It meant they were too advanced to store in his Ring of Spell storage. The handy little band had saved his bacon several times. Being able to cast a spell immediately in case of emergency gave an amazing tactical advantage in any situation. Still, he wasn’t complaining.

The first phase of the journey was blessedly uneventful. Night fell, but the mist lights they took with them were enough to navigate the forest. Richter had been concerned that the lights could be seen in the forest, giving away their position, but Hisako had already foreseen that issue and had a simple solution. She cast a mass spell on all of the lights before they left the village. Now, anyone more than fifty paces from an individual light could not see it. It didn’t impede the sight abilities of those holding the globes, but it did create a strange effect. To the members of the warband near the front of the column, it looked like those in the rear were walking in darkness. Those in back had the same impression of the front. Weird or not, her spell made things much safer, and she said it should last for twelve hours.

Scouts were deployed ahead and around the warband. They periodically reported observing animals or low level monsters, but nothing stronger. As Richter had predicted, though, these creatures fled before the war party. While the sprites traveled in near-complete silence, Richter’s guards stomped, broke branches and cursed as they walked through the forest. If not for the movement bonus from Richter’s War Leader skill, it might have taken all night to reach the edge of his domain. Because of him, they left the mists after only about three hours. The mist lights stopped working, and the true danger had begun.

There was no natural demarcation that they had traveled ten miles, but the trees had gradually been getting less dense. It made travel faster, but also increased the chances of the war party being seen. Yoshi had made it clear that the goblins could very well have scouts placed throughout the woods. The Battle Leader tripled the number of scouts that were around the warband.

Torches were lit and enspelled. The army traveled more miles. True night had fallen, and the canopy above blocked out all moon and starlight. Without being told to do so, all members of the war party clustered closer together. Though battle loomed with the dawn, they all instinctively knew one thing. The night was dark and full of terrors… They were right.

A scream was the first indication that they were under attack. By then, it was too late. Something swooped in from above and carried away one of his guardsmen from the back of the warband before anyone could react. The scream lasted only a few seconds before it cut off abruptly. While everyone searched the skies, arrows nocked, another scream echoed from the front of the line. Again, from just the corner of his eye, Richter saw something large speed by and grab a sprite before disappearing into the dark of the forest again. This time the screams did not end quickly. Instead, they grew louder and more piteous, seemingly just out of range of the light the warband carried.

The Mist Village guards had begun to run towards the sounds of the screaming, but stopped when Yoshi shouted, “Stand fast! Stay shoulder to shoulder and do not let yourself be surprised.”

Manic laughter rose from all around them, and fear began to infect their hearts. Mutters popped up throughout the warband, “There must be dozens of them! I can still hear him screaming! What is happening? Why are we even here? We are going to die!” Another dark blur flew in from east to west, and two of the warband fell to the ground screaming, large gouges on their faces.

Richter felt an urge to run, to give up, and to abandon hope. Doubts and fears began to worm themselves into his heart, and his thoughts were occupied by basically anything except standing fast against whatever was attacking them. Then it stopped.

Confused and befuddled, Richter checked his combat log.

Richter has been assaulted by unknown Fear attack.

Richter has resisted unknown Fear attack.

Whether it was because of the Fighting Spirit of the warband, the bonus from the pixies’ song, or if it was because of his various resistances, Richter was able to fight off the magic caused by the maniacal laughter that surrounded him. The doubts that had assaulted him faded into the background. He was able to stop feeling like they came from within, and instead clearly identified them as an assault from without. Doubt faded and a familiar transformation began to overtake him. Fuck fear, he thought. I’ll take rage!

Alma had been trying to communicate with him for the past few seconds, but Richter’s mental turmoil had kept him from hearing her. As soon as his mind cleared, her message came through to him.

*I see it. It’s coming for me!*

His agile familiar was weaving through the trees as one of the monsters chased her. The dragonling had had the foresight to cast Weak Haste, Weak Life Armor and Weak Life Aura once she had seen the monster chasing her. As she sent him a mental image, he couldn’t disagree with her choice.

It wasn’t black, but it had blue skin so close to midnight that the difference was academic. Its overall body was humanoid, and it had a mane of thick, dirty grey hair. Each hand only had three fingers, but they were large and tipped with dark talons. It grinned as it chased his familiar and a faint green light would be seen emanating from its mouth, outlining a mouth filled with long, needle-like teeth.

*Bring it to me!* he shouted mentally. Richter placed an arrow to his bow and began to imbue it. He poured his mana into the magic field around the arrow and pulled on the connection he had with Alma, accessing his newly enhanced subskill. Another scream echoed from his right, and then two from his left, but he didn’t let himself be distracted. He couldn’t help those who had just been attacked by running around like a headless chicken. What he could do was protect his familiar and take out one of the attackers. Besides, he wasn’t alone.

Yoshi had fought off the effects of the magical fear as well. The Battle Leader wasted no time and climbed to the top of a nearby boulder. Raising blade into the air, he activated a Talent that was only available to Warriors with the War Leader skill, Valiant Anger. Everyone in his Sphere of Influence gained a 200% bonus against Fear, Feeblemind and Confusion effects. The Talent also channeled any negated effects into anger, increasing the Fighting Spirit of all those afflicted. A low roar of anger spread through the warband, that rose in volume until the manic laughter of the flying creatures was drowned out.

The Hearth Mother also entered the fray. As important as Yoshi’s efforts were, she would not be outdone. As soon as the attacks started, she began casting. Her hands moved in intricate patterns, and golden Life energy began to surround her arms. The will of the sprite leader was too great to be affected by the fear-inducing laughter of the monsters attacking them, and her spell continued unabated. Words that were beautiful in shape, but still horrible in the power, flowed from her lips, and reality was shaped by a Master of magic. Eight seconds later, she finished her spell, “Rana ito Callaban!”

The initial manifestation of her spell, Lira’s Death Prison, was humble. A pale globe of golden energy floated into the air, growing larger as it rose. A tether of energy connected it to Hisako’s chest, and she continued to feed mana into the spell. Initially only a foot across, the globe quickly grew to four feet, then eight, before finally swelling to a diameter of ten feet. The walls of the globe seemed to strain for a moment, then it burst!

Particles of golden light flew everywhere. The motes of light weren’t stopped by the flesh of bodies or the wood of the trees. Instead, they flew through them, leaving a luminescent gold residue on anyone they touched. They shot out for two hundred yards in every direction, and every member of the warband as well as the creatures attacking them were struck and began to glow. If the fact that they stopped laughing and started howling in anger was any indication, the attackers were furious about it.

The motes of light all stopped moving at once, and began to hover in midair. Then they flared, and a dome of pale golden light phased into existence. One of the monsters, easily seen with the motes of light sticking to it, tried to fly past the barrier. As soon as it touched the wall of the dome, the golden light flared, and the creature was thrown back. It screamed in pain, one wing flapping weaker than the other, as it took refuge in a tree.

“Kill them now,” Hisako called out in a fierce voice. “The spell will only last for ten minutes. Do not let them escape!” She began casting again, and the sprites began imbuing arrows, sighting on the ten or so monsters that could now be clearly seen. Since the monsters had stopped their laughter, even those that had remained stricken after Yoshi used his Talent were able to shake off the monsters’ Fear effect. Led by Sion, Terrod, Caulder and the Battle Leader, they started hunting. Richter’s attention remained on his familiar and the arrow he was imbuing.

The aura around the arrow had progressed from the barber pole appearance to the continually moving black and gold yin-yang. Blue-white lightning danced across the aura. It was time. Richter sent a message to Alma to bring the creature towards him. She had been weaving between the trees, buying the precious seconds Richter needed until he was ready. The dragonling banked sharply around a trunk, staying just ahead of the monster’s grasping talons. The thing cried out in frustration at being unable to catch the nimble psionic.

At her master’s order, Alma put on a burst of speed and flew towards the warband. The monster was furious enough now that it barely noticed flying out of the safety of the trees. It did notice the strangely glowing arrow pointing at it, however. The monster started to veer off and flee back into the relative safety of the dark. That was when it learned that Alma had never actually been prey.

In a feat of extreme agility, Alma flapped hard and then tucked her wings next to her body. A yellow aura surrounded her as she flipped head over tail, until she was facing the screaming face of her pursuer. She took one moment to wink at the monster, something she had seen Richter do when he was trying to be particularly obnoxious, then a bolt of lightning shot from her body into the open mouth of the monster.

The spell might be called Weak Lightning Bolt, but striking the enemy flyer in the face was a critical hit! The lightning surged down its body, and between Alma’s high level, her 50% bonus to Air magic and the vulnerable spot where the creature was struck, the spell overwhelmed the monster’s defenses; it was stunned!

With her wings folded in, Alma’s body dropped like a stone. The monster’s body passed over her, falling as well, but on a higher trajectory. After falling five feet, she spread her wings again, catching the air, and flapped to gain altitude. The night was cut by her shriek of victory as Richter finished the ambush the two had psychically planned.

Correcting slightly for the change in his target’s speed, Richter finished a slow exhale and released. The black and gold arrow sped towards the senseless monster, striking it in the face with a resounding BOOM! Echoing detonations sounded around the globe as the sprites brought down more and more of the creatures, but again, Richter’s focus was only on the monster that had dared to attack his familiar. The five hundred mana he had imbued into the arrow had struck like a Mack truck and arrested most of its forward momentum. Richter stumbled slightly. The near depletion of his mana pool gave him a horrible headache and his vision blurred. With gritted teeth, he focused and his vision cleared. The monster fell almost straight down, and he used Analyze.

The fucking thing was still alive! Between the five hundred mana he had invested, its helpless Stunned state and scoring a critical hit to its head, Richter had been sure that it would have died in one blow. And what the fuck was a level thirty-four undead monster doing loitering around just outside of the boundaries of his village?

The koolari slammed into the ground. It had tumbled as it fell and one wing was snapped in multiple places upon impact. It lost another forty-three health. The battle continued to rage around him, and Richter was about to hit it with another arrow, but before he could draw another arrow back, Alma attacked. Her body glowed golden before latching onto the back of its head. The blue-white crystal began to flash with an inner light as she used Brain Drain.

Richter’s heart began to beat faster in panic. As soon as Alma latched on, the koolari overcame the Stun effect from Weak Lightning. The monster was ridiculously resilient. At the seventh rank, her Brain Drain was still too weak to incapacitate any creature over level thirty-one. The koolari began to reach back to pull the small dragonling off.

Before Richter could react, he noticed a small blue-white crystal floating near its head. The crystal flashed, and the creature’s body locked tight. Surprised, Richter used Analyze again and was astonished to see its health, mana, and stamina dropping at a prodigious rate. Her Brain Drain had never been so effective before. The chaos seed’s amazement grew as he read the battle prompts.

Richter hits Winged Koolari using Enhanced Imbue Arrow...

Winged Koolari resists Mind Fog.

Winged Koolari resists Stun.

Winged Koolari succumbs to Psi Crystallization.

Alma attacks Winged Koolari with Brain Drain! Presence of Level 1 Psi Crystal increases strength of all psychic attacks and powers by 100%.

That was how she had done it! Her ability to stun creatures had been doubled to potentially take out level sixty-two monsters! From the rate that the koolari’s health was falling, it also doubled the rate of her Brain Drain. His enhanced subskill was already proving its worth!

In no time at all, the winged koolari slumped to the ground, dead. Alma rose into the air, while a rainbow-colored ribbon of light swirled around her. The dragonling cried out her victory to the air while she went hunting for more prey.

More screams had echoed out in the night. The koolari, seeing that they were trapped and could no longer hide in the darkness, went on the attack. Guards and sprites alike cried out as talons raked their bodies. The warband was not helpless, however. Yoshi jumped high and sliced through the wing of a koolari that made the mistake of swooping too low. It fell to the ground and was quickly stabbed to death by other members of the war party. Two more had been brought down by well-placed, imbued arrows. As strong as the monsters were, once they were on the ground, they were easily overwhelmed by sheer numbers and hacked to death.

The battle went on for a few more minutes, but soon enough, all of the monsters were brought low. The last three tried vainly to escape after the rest of their pack was slaughtered, but they still couldn’t overcome the power of Hisako’s spell. Richter shouted that he wanted them alive, and one by one, imbued arrows struck their wings and forced them to the ground. After that, it was a relatively simple, if dangerous matter to shoot them until they were within inches of a true death. Alma would swoop in afterward and drain them, capturing their souls as well. Prompts filled Richter’s vision.

He was almost one hundred and seventy thousand points closer to paying back his experience deficit. Alma had also managed to level up twice! Fighting these high-level creatures was profitable… as long as you could ignore the “human” cost.

Moans of pain and cries for help echoed up from the wounded. Thankfully, there was no shortage of healers in the group. In addition to the village guardsmen, at least fifteen of the sprites from Hisako’s host had Life magic. That did not even take into account the Hearth Mother herself. Watching her was a true wonder. Without hesitation or squeamishness, Richter saw her push a woman’s intestines back into her body before uttering a spell. A few moments before, the guard had been at death’s door. Now, not only had the wound closed, but the villager was back on her feet and color had started to come back to her cheeks

Blood covered Hisako’s hands, face, and body, but she simply moved on to the next injured person. The sprites knew without being told to bring her the worst cases. Richter ran up and handed over three mana potions which she downed without comment and just continued healing. He drank one himself, eager to get his forces back to fighting shape as soon as possible.

The final count was nine dead, three of Hisako’s sprites and six guards, one of them an Air caster. There was also a wood sprite missing, telling the tale that at least one of the koolari had escaped before Hisako’s spell went up. The shield was dropped as soon as the last monster they could find was killed, but they still could find no trace of the poor sprite. Hisako looked around with a silent fury on her face that she would not even be able to honor her dead. She ordered the bodies of all of the dead gathered, enemy and ally alike.

When they were done, even the uninjured were covered in blood from helping their fallen comrades. Richter cast Far Light multiple times, and several aeromancers cast Gentle Rain. Everyone tried to wash the blood off as best they could.





CHAPTER 22 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The good news was that they lost no one else due to injury. Richter and the other biomages were able to stabilize or heal most wounds, and Hisako performed miracles when needed. Sprites that Richter had thought were already dead were soon back on their feet. After about thirty minutes, he had done what he could and went to find the Hearth Mother. She had gone behind a dense thicket, and the worst of the wounded had been brought to her. Dozens of sprites surrounded it. To his great surprise, when he walked closer, one of the sprites held a hand out, “I must ask you to come no closer, Lord Richter.”

“What are you doing?” he asked in extreme confusion. The sprites had never refused him anything before, least of all the right to walk in his own forest. Before he could protest, however, Hisako’s weary voice came from the thicket.

“Let the lord pass.”

The sprite whose hand had been on his chest nodded and stepped to the side. Still confused and now somewhat irritated, Richter walked by. Ten exhausted sprites walked past him in the other direction. A quick use of Analyze showed that almost all of their mana had been depleted. Ten more entered with the chaos seed and, without being asked, formed two lines of five. Each held hands, and the leader of each group laid a hand upon one of Hisako’s shoulders.

The Hearth Mother looked at Richter and said, “Know the truth, my ally.” Then she began to chant. The body of a dead sprite was laid before her. His chest had been ripped open by a koolari’s claws, and the sprite’s eyes stared sightlessly off into the ether. Richter didn’t know what she was doing, but he understood that he was being allowed to see something secret. The chaos seed kept his peace.

Her casting went on for a full minute, then another. Richter’s amazement at her abilities grew. Even a ten-second casting pushed his own control to the limit. The Hearth Mother showed no signs of stopping. The golden luminescence on her hands grew brighter and brighter. After another thirty seconds, the arcane words rose in volume, and Yoshi took a small glowing root from a pouch. He placed the herb upon the dead sprite’s forehead. Hisako finished her spell and clapped her hands together. A ripple of barely tangible force emanated from her hands, and the golden light shot towards the root.

What happened next changed Richter’s view of The Land forever. The dead sprite breathed! Color made its way back into his ashen cheeks, and the rent in his chest closed. He sat up quickly, hacking and coughing. To Richter’s disgust, a thick black substance flew onto the sprite’s chin. The resurrected fighter quickly reached up and began to pull. The dark goo was slowly drawn from his mouth. It fought his efforts, like a parasite that did not want to leave its host.

Richter moved forward to help, but Yoshi stopped him, “No. He must do this himself. The final choice, of life or death, is his alone.”

The sprite continued hacking and coughing. His fair face turned red from lack of air, and more than a dozen sprites watched their fellow struggle to survive. With a last forceful exhale, the sprite forced the last of the black substance from his lungs. Richter’s Herb Lore skill triggered.

You have found:

Rejected Death Shroud

Durability: 2/27

Herb Class: Rare.

Quality: Poor

Weight: 0.2 kg

Traits: This shroud has come back across the veil with one who has been resurrected. It is pure Death. It can be used as part of a summoning ritual for such creatures or to make a nearly incurable poison. If left unattended, it will search for another victim to ride back through the veil, causing the death of the one it finds.





“Is it an herb or is it alive?” Richter asked in confusion. The thing was moving like an amoeba.

“Neither,” Yoshi spat. With a look of controlled hate, the adept speared the thing with the edge of his sword. The amorphous blob was already trying to move away. A high-pitched keening, almost beyond Richter’s hearing range, rang out once Yoshi impaled it. The adept threw it into a small fire the sprites had built. The shroud’s scream faded as it burned away to nothing.

The ten sprites that had been giving their mana to Hisako slumped, exhausted. The Hearth Mother herself had sat down on a nearby boulder. Richter watched the sprite that had been brought back from the dead in amazement. His fellows clapped him on the back, and he gave them a shaky grin. It was clear that the resurrected sprite was weak as a kitten, but he still found the strength to kneel before the Hearth Mother. Words in sprite-speak fell from his lips, “Kona korit’onai to shī wa arata no saichi yaku ro ni sha.”

The sprite words always sounded Asian to Richter’s ears. Back on Earth he had only spoken English and some Spanish, but in The Land, his Gift of Tongues ability easily translated the revived man’s sentiment, ‘This unworthy soul thanks the Mother for his life, and promises it to you anew.”

The man kissed the hem of Hisako’s robe, and she fondly placed her hand on his head. Then he rose and walked away. Other sprite magi cast spells of healing and restoration upon him, and soon he was back to fighting shape. The sprite took his breastplate off, and the sound of hammering filled the glade as he tried to close the rent in his armor.

While this was happening, thoughts continued to spin around Richter’s mind. His emotions swirled, and he slowly shook his head as he dealt with the onslaught. Above all else, however, one word continued to rise to the surface. Petal.

Richter looked at the Hearth Mother. She looked calmly and tiredly back at him, knowing what he was about to say. Emotions played across the chaos seed’s face until he could take it no longer and he cried out, “Why?”

Into that single word was all of his sadness and loss. It also held recrimination towards the Hearth Mother for not saving his people, for not saving her! If she could bring back the dead, then why hadn’t she? Why had she let Petal die? Why had she let them all die? Why had she been amazed at his CPR? His medical skills were nothing compared to this magic! Was she so cruel to mock him while his people lay dead, all to protect this secret? WHY? He was wailing in his own head as Hisako looked back at him in sympathy.

When she spoke, there was no defense in her voice. There was only sympathy, “I know well what is in your heart, my friend. What you feel now is why this is a secret that must be kept. If it was widely known that death did not need to be final, then wars would be fought. Men and women would murder thousands if it meant giving themselves even one more day. What you have just seen is the height of Life magic, and it is not without cost. The root that Yoshi placed on my warrior’s head is rare. It is a special herb that comes from the Hearth Tree itself, and it grows slowly. Only such a pure expression of Life magic can bring the dead back. When your village was attacked, I did not have the necessary spell ingredients to resurrect either your people or mine.”

Richter blinked, a tear escaping from one eye. Emotions he had thought gone had simply been repressed. The chaos seed well remembered holding a grieving mother as she mourned the loss of her child. He nodded for Hisako to continue.

“You cannot stop death, Lord Richter. No being can halt it completely. How would you choose, Lord Richter? If there were only five of the necessary ingredients in your whole village, would you use one to bring a hunter back to life, knowing that it meant you might not be able to revive one of your warriors on the morrow? Could you let your people know that the power of life and death was in your hands, knowing that you must deny the request of a grieving mother to bring a child back one day in the future?” Richter’s heart clenched. It was as if she was looking inside of his soul. She softly added a warning, “I have seen settlements ripped asunder for less.”

The chaos seed wanted to deny her words, but he knew that she spoke the truth. Richter hung his head. Despite the fact that he was proving her very point, he fell to both knees, “Will you save my men, Hearth Mother?” He thought he had hardened his heart against the deaths of his people and the losses he had suffered, but in this one moment, he understood that he had simply been ignoring the pain in hopes that it would fade and disappear.

“I will try,” she agreed wearily, “if you will lend me your magic. And your strength. You must choose, however. This far from the Hearth Tree, I will not be able to bring back anyone that has been dead for more than an hour. I will have the time to save two more of your people, possibly three, but not all six that have fallen. Choose.”

Richter’s heart nearly broke as he looked at the bodies of his six men. Six brave souls that had made the final sacrifice for him. He would reward half by deeming them “less.” He looked at Hisako, anguish clear on his face. She merely looked back, her face now steel, “Such is the weight of leadership. Time grows short, Lord Richter. Choose.”

Hating her, and himself, and the world for putting him in such a position, he pointed at his aeromancer, “Him first.”

More sprites filed in to replace those whose mana pools had been depleted. This time, Richter took his place at the head of one of the lines and placed a hand on Hisako’s shoulder. A prompt filled his vision again.

Hisako, the Hearth Mother, would like to access your mana core. Do you wish to allow this? Yes or No? Alert! Doing this can allow the other party to cause you great and irreparable harm!

He disregarded the warning and chose ‘Yes.’ Gold light once again surrounded her hands, and her chanting filled the air. There was an almost physical sensation of pulling as she drew on his mana. Richter was tempted to resist at first, but by giving into it, though, the “wrongness” of it faded away. It was replaced with the feeling of being part of something greater than himself. A few minutes later, his Air mage sat up and began coughing. The drama of the death shroud played itself out again. It took the caster longer to expel the shroud and when he finally did, it was larger and more mobile than the first. Yoshi quickly placed it in the fire.

His caster looked at Richter, “My lord? My lord, what happened? What was that thing inside of me?” Alarm began to cross the man’s features. His words were questioning as he tried to remember, “I was fighting. I was fighting, and then…”

The chaos seed interrupted his guard’s confused musings. He had already decided what to tell the man, “You were knocked unconscious during the battle. The undead spit something on you that crawled in your mouth. Luckily, Lady Hisako was able to force it out of you. The sprites will take you to our biomancers.” The man opened his mouth to speak again, but Richter firmly said, “On your way, soldier.”

The caster walked away, still confused and looking doubtful, but did as he was bid. Once he left the thicket, Yoshi threw back the cloaks that were hiding the other bodies. It was a sensible precaution the adept had taken without being asked. Richter didn’t hesitate. He just pointed to the next guard that he wanted resurrected. The man wasn’t the strongest or the highest level of the dead guards, but he had a family and children. A small part of Richter’s innocence died, but he didn’t shy from his duty. Richter drank a mana potion and placed his hand on Hisako’s shoulder again. “If you are ready, Hearth Mother, let us begin.”





CHAPTER 23 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Hisako had been right. They were able to save three of his men in total. The last one resurrected almost died again. The death shroud was firmly entrenched in her body. There was blood on it when it had finally been pulled from the guard’s throat. The creature had held on so tightly that it ripped tissue from the inside of the woman’s body. Even after the shroud was burning in the fire, the guard continued to hack up gouts of blood. It was only through the intervention of sprite healers that the bleeding was stopped. Richter knew without being told that they could not save the rest.

Hisako lay exhausted. She still found the strength to give Richter a warning. While the power of resurrection could be wonderful, it also opened a doorway to great evil. The shroud had to be destroyed. If it was allowed to live, it could grow into a being of horrible, destructive power. She also warned him against attempting a resurrection if the body had been dead for more than an hour. The shroud grew stronger the longer the body had been dead. Even if the resurrection failed, the shroud could still be unleashed upon The Land.

Richter agreed, and Yoshi handed over a small pouch of five of the glowing roots. The Hearth Mother assured him that Sumiko could cast the spell. Hisako gave him a final warning to keep the roots secret. She also reiterated that he was being given such a gift only because of their strong relationship and alliance. The chaos seed nodded and opened the bag.

You have found:

Rebirth Root of the Hearth Tree

Durability: 4/4

Herb Class: Rare.

Quality: Living

Weight: 0.2 kg

Traits: This root has been gathered from deep beneath the Hearth Tree of the Wood Sprites. It has concentrated the Life energy of the Place of Power and the many residents who live above it. You feel that it could be used to greatly augment the summoning of Life creatures. If placed in contact with Death creatures, it could also destroy it or at least greatly limit its powers. Adding this root to any Health potion would improve both its strength and level by 3 ranks.





“I don’t see the capability of the root to resurrect,” Richter said.

Hisako smiled and gave a tired laugh, “That is because you are only an apprentice in Herb Lore. There is still much you have to learn, young lord.”

Richter nodded. This was actually a good thing. It meant he could try to grow it in the village garden, without any of his villagers learning of its properties. He didn’t realize it, but that was the moment that he fully committed to deceiving his own people. It was done with the best of intentions, but it was done.

Hisako needed another thirty minutes to recover. While she did, they finally spoke about his use of CPR to revive a dwarf after the bugbear attack. He explained what he had done, stopping several times to answer her questions. She then quizzed him even more, taxing his unused medical knowledge. She just nodded in response to many of the things he told her, as if he was confirming things she already suspected about the workings of the body. When he began speaking of DNA and other macromolecules, however, her eyes grew wide. The questions came faster, and she started to smile as if long-questioned mysteries questions were finally being answered.

When she was recovered, they made their way out of the thicket. The troops looked grateful for the rest after the attack. One unhappy task remained before they moved out again. “What do we do with the dead?” he asked. “We are too far from my Place of Power for me to summon mist workers. We can’t send them back, and we can’t take them with us into battle.”

“I will show you,” Hisako said. Her tone was gentle, but pragmatic. “First, strip the bodies of anything useful.”

Soon all arms, armor, and items were taken from the dead. Potions and water were distributed among the other soldiers. Richter had looked around at first, concerned that his men and women might think him heartless, but no one batted an eye. The realities of battle and sudden death were instilled in the people of The Land. Arms and armor, especially those that were enchanted, were simply too valuable to waste. When the bodies were laid bare, she extended both hands and started casting. The mystical syllables were familiar to Richter. She was ensuring that the dead would not one day rise again.

With that done, she began a different casting. The words did not have the rich tones of Life magic but instead hung heavy and solid in the air. Green light formed a nimbus around her hands, and the earth began to vibrate. The ground beneath the bodies of their fallen comrades turned loose like sand. The Hearth Mother turned her arms so that her palms were pointing down and then she slowly lowered her hands down, as if she was pushing. The bodies sank beneath the ground. The light faded from her hands, and the dead were set to rest. The piled carcasses of the winged koolari remained on solid ground off to the side. Hisako would not bury the fell creatures with the village’s dead.





CHAPTER 24 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The two Masters stayed close together as the warband readied itself to move again. Hisako spoke in a low-pitched but serious voice, “Those were not mere skeletons or low level zombies, Lord Richter.” She had completely removed the gore off of herself and her clothes. A Light spell was all it took to clean every speck of blood, leaving Richter honestly a bit jealous. It looked like she was wearing a simple robe, but knowing the Hearth Mother, it probably gave better defense than his own armor.

“Those were koolari,” Yoshi cosigned. “They should not be here. I might have expected to find them in the Whispering Woods, but not in the Forest of Nadria.”

“Why are these undead appearing near your settlement?” Hisako asked Richter pointedly. “First the barrow beasts and now these accursed things appear in the forest. What is happening?”

Richter looked back and forth at the two of them. He had meant to go over this earlier, but there hadn’t seemed to have been time. He now saw that waiting had been a mistake. “The barrow beasts were not the first undead I have encountered in my lands.” Richter proceeded to tell them about how he had found a hidden dungeon while exploring. He quickly spoke of the decaemur knight that had guarded it, and how, after vanquishing the undead guardian, he had relived a memory Alma had stolen from the monster.

Hisako face went from concerned to furious as he spoke of how the decaemur knight had been damned. Richter described the bloody sacrifice of the knight’s people, and how the undead had let his own daughter be ripped apart by unnatural monsters. Then the chaos seed started speaking of the eldritch lord that had been the true architect of the villagers’ suffering. Hisako’s gaze grew alarmed as he spoke of how the undead caster somehow became aware of Richter’s presence and had almost touched his mind before Richter had ended the memory.

“Are you sure that you escaped detection?” Hisako asked urgently. “Are you positive that it did not glean any information from you?”

“I felt his magic reaching towards me,” Richter said. “I would stake my life that he did not touch my mind, but there is no doubt that he knew someone was watching. If he had gotten any information, though, why would these undead attacks only be starting now? The sacrifices were long ago, so if he had seen me, he would have known about me for centuries.”

Hisako waved her hand, “You were not actually there when the events happened the first time, so this lich lord could not have seen you then. I am not sure how you were detected, but I am not a master of Mental magic. Perhaps the evil you saw slumbered until you killed the protector of the Dark portal. I do not know, and we do not have time for a discussion on temporal arcanae. Now please tell me, is there anything else that I need to know?”

Richter nodded and told her of his quest, Proper Rest II. It involved the spirits of the knight’s daughter and all of the other sacrificial victims. They had risen from their remains and attacked the village, driven mad by centuries of hate. Luckily, Sumiko had been there, and the Life master had been able to vanquish the ghosts. Surprisingly, Krista, the spirit of the knight’s daughter, had returned after the battle. The spirit had been greatly changed. She had no longer glowed with the neon-green of eldritch magic. She also no longer wore had the festering wounds that had marked her ethereal body when she previously attacked. The greatest change was that her rage had also been replaced by, not peace exactly, but instead a calm resolve.

Krista had promised that the spirits of all the sacrificial victims would hold off on moving to their long-awaited rest. To prove her words, she had given Richter a coin, saying that he could call on them if he needed their help to fight the lich lord. He took it from his Bag of Holding and showed it to the sprite leader.

Hisako took the glowing coin and held it in her hand. As she closed her eyes, a look of peace came over her face, “This is not a coin. It is a piece of her spiritual energy. Not too different from how you can now make your mana tangible. You are right; her spirit has been cleansed. I can feel the purity of her spiritual energy. There is no innocence, but also none of the rage that Sumiko described to me. An object like this cannot last forever, however. How long do you have to use it?”

“She said one month,” Richter replied.

“One month?” Hisako asked, her voice rising in incredulity. “How long ago did you receive this?”

“A couple weeks ago,” Richter responded, “I know that time is running out, but so much-”

“Bah!” she said waving her hands to shut him up. “Be specific! What day did you receive this coin?”

Richter thought for a moment, and then said, “It was twenty-nine days ago.”

Hisako and Yoshi looked at each other. “It would have been the second of Kuborn,” the adept said. “That means there are only ten days until the second of Juren.”

She nodded and then turned to Richter, “You have no idea how lucky you are. Kuborn is one of the longest months of the year. If this had occurred only one month before, in Kerult, your time would have elapsed. Even still, Yoshi is correct. Only ten days remain for you to complete this quest with her aid. I have a feeling we will need it.”

“I know that this undead lord, whoever he is, needs to be confronted,” Richter said, “but there is so much more that needs to be done. He has stayed quiet for centuries. I’m just saying that maybe we can deal with the enemies we have before looking for more. Surely he can keep until we deal with the bugbears.”

“No!” Hisako said fiercely. Even Yoshi seemed surprised at her vehemence. “I understand your reasoning, Lord Richter, but you are wrong. There will never be a perfect time to confront evil. There will always be more enemies to battle. The mere fact that you are gaining power will attract those who wish to destroy you. We must face the threat of the undead now!

“This is not some rogue necromancer we are dealing with. You are describing a lich lord who seems to have mastered eldritch magic. Undead are attacking during the day, and now high level living undead are attacking in the forest with impunity. It has only been three weeks. We cannot afford to let this threat grow for months. After we deal with these goblins, we must prepare to destroy this den of undead. Yoshi and I will help as much as we can, but we must move quickly. I feel in my heart that Krista’s help will be invaluable. No matter what, however, this threat must be eliminated.” Her voice became somewhat more formal, “As the ally of the Hearth Tree, I expect the Mist Village to help destroy this menace.”

Richter’s eyes widened slightly as he realized that Hisako was no longer speaking as a friend and mentor, but instead as one ruler to another. That realization was further cemented as a prompt filled his vision.

Quest Update: Proper Rest II. Hisako has formally charged you with removing what she considers a dire threat. The Wood Sprites of the Hearth Tree have invoked their alliance with the Mist Village. After the goblin encampment is destroyed, she requires that all of your efforts, and the resources of your village, be focused upon destroying the Lich Lord. Failure to complete this quest will cause substantial damage to your settlement’s relationship with the Hearth Tree and will also damage your personal relationship with Hisako. Time remaining to complete this Quest to the Hearth Mother’s satisfaction: 10 days.

Richter had picked up on the fact that Hisako was serious from her tone, but reading the prompt disturbed him. If he understood it properly, his alliance with the wood sprites would be in jeopardy if he failed his quest. His relationship with the sprites was a cornerstone of his life in The Land. It had never really occurred to him that he might lose their steadfast support. Seeing as the sprites were his only allies in a world full of enemies and monsters, he took what she was saying very seriously.

Speaking formally to match her tone, Richter said, “Lady Hisako. Your support and friendship mean more to me than all the gold in all kingdoms of this world. I know I still have much to learn and count myself lucky that you have chosen to stand beside me to meet the dangers of The Land. You will never need to doubt my dedication to our friendship or our alliance. I promise you, we will destroy this threat.”

Hisako relaxed her gaze, and her face softened, “Thank you, Lord Richter. I am sorry if it appeared that I doubted you. As children of the forest, my people will always stand against forces that will corrupt it. Thank you for honoring your commitment to us.”

You have received +500 (base +250) Relationship Points with Hisako. Current Relationship: Ally. Total Relationship Points: 102,378.

The Mist Village has received +500 (base +250) Relationship Points with the Hearth Tree. Current Relationship: Ally. Total Relationship Points: 101,411.

The Mist Village has received 500 (base +250) Diplomacy Points in regards to the Hearth Tree.

Lack of Town Hallcauses complete loss of any gained Diplomacy Points. Current Diplomacy Points (Mist Village→ Hearth Tree):0

Know This! You have made a bold promise to the Hearth Mother. She has taken you at your word. All relationship and diplomacy bonuses increased by 100%. Failure to fulfill your promise will cause any losses to relationship and diplomacy to be increased by 500%. Never forget, your words have meaning!

500%, Richter thought, incredulous! So, basically, if he fucked this quest up, his alliance was gone? The sprites wouldn’t abandon him completely, but it took a hundred thousand points for them to look at him as an ally. The chaos seed was still discovering what all of this meant, but he was pretty sure that he didn’t want to lose his “ally” status. He didn’t think the sprites would completely abandon him, but it might disrupt their trade agreement for instance.

Richter shook his head. Were the higher stakes because he had used the word “promise”? Abrams and Whedon, he really had to watch his big mouth! Why the hell did it always seem like it was getting him into trouble? Why couldn’t he just be like his boy Ash and get himself out of trouble with a smooth, “Well, uhhh, that’s just what we call pillow talk, baby.”

There was nothing for it now. He was committed. Besides, he wasn’t planning on failing. He put the consequences of failure out of his mind. One thing that did grind his gears, though, was the loss of the Diplomacy points. He wasn’t even sure what they were, but he was sure he wanted them. Richter resolved to make building a townhall a priority when he got back. It would go right up on the list with his other high priorities, like making a barracks, and building the wall higher, and getting more researchers, and, oh yeah, destroying an undead lord in the heart of his own kingdom!

Richter did his best to keep the frustration and dismay off of his face. Instead, he bowed slightly and said, “It is I who am honored, Master Hisako.”

The Hearth Mother smiled at him and handed back Krista’s coin. She gave a quick command to Yoshi, and the adept started moving around the warband, doing last minute checks. The koolari attack had cost them both lives and time. There was still a task to be done, however. The Hearth Mother was standing next to the pile of dead monsters and was whispering a spell. A white glow appeared on her hand, and she touched her second and third finger to the space between her eyes. The aura faded a moment later, and she simply said, “Hmm.”

Richter looked at her for a few seconds, but her attention stayed on the body of the koolari that she was looking over. Finally, he asked, “Hmm, what?”

She looked up at him like she had forgotten he was there, but then wove her hand through the air again, almost absently, and said, “Paras Revalde.” A white glow enveloped her fingers for a second time, and she touched him between his eyes. Richter’s response was a bit more enthused: “Whoa!”

It was like his Herb Lore skill had gotten supersized! Since reaching apprentice rank, most plants that he saw had a slight glow to them. It indicated that they could be used for some crafting purpose, either as a potion component, a piece of an item or a spell component. He was also able to identify many positive and negative effects that would come from just eating them. Richter could control it at this point; the glow barely noticeable at baseline, but it grew brighter when he paid close attention. Not anymore.

Everything around him was almost pulsing with color. It was not glaring in any way but instead gave everything a faint phosphorescence. That was only the beginning, however. His Herb Lore sight normally just gave plants a faint glow that matched their color. Red lautum glowed red, Krin ocher glowed orange, and so on. Now, however, plants and certain parts of the koolari were illuminated in colors different from what he could normally see. The colors were familiar, though. After a moment, he realized what Hisako’s spell was actually doing. The chaos seed felt compelled to express himself even more eloquently than before, “Dooooode!”

Every useful herb nearby was glowing in a color that reflected its rarity. Most of the plants around were glowing white to show that they were common. There was a fair smattering of green and even a few spots of blue to indicate uncommon and unusual herbs. Richter wiped his head back and forth, vainly hoping to see the red of rare or the yellow of mythic plants or perhaps even the orange of a legendary component. It didn’t happen.

What he did see, however, and what had made Hisako ‘huh’ was that the throats of each of the Koolari were glowing the exact shade of purple that his scarce items had in prompts. Richter looked at Hisako, and she nodded.

“Let me know what you find,” the Hearth Mother said before walking off. “We need to leave in five minutes.”

Richter drew his moonstone dagger from his belt and got started. For the millionth time, he bemoaned how hard it was to get loot from monsters in The Land! Just having a window open up when you killed an enemy was so much easier! First, the chaos seed tried to wedge open the monster’s throat, but its jaw was locked tight in death. He considered breaking the jaw with the pommel of his weapon, but opted for a subtler approach.

Placing the koolari flat on its back, the chaos seed tilted the head back and started slicing vertically down its throat. The cartilage in the neck resisted him somewhat, but this blade was able to create a fairly neat incision. Thick black blood welled out of the wound, but the purple glow grew a bit brighter. After widening the cut a bit more, Richter laid his dagger to the side and reached two fingers from each hand into the hole he had made in its throat. After that, it was just a matter of tearing.

The flesh didn’t feel too different from uncooked goat. Ripping the meat of the koolari’s neck took him back to his tenth birthday, when his father had decided to ‘make him a man.’ Long story short, he had learned three things that day. One, if you were going to kill your dinner, it was much less traumatic to kill it with your first shot. Two, his mother did not find it amusing to see her son with dried blood splattered all over his face, hair and clothes; and three, cutting flesh was a good deal harder when it hadn’t been cooked yet.

Despite the meat being tough, it yielded quickly to Richter’s thirty-three points of Strength. He wiped some of the blood clean from his right hand, using the detritus of the forest floor as a gritty napkin. Then, pouring a bit of water into the hole, he was finally rewarded for his labors.

The inside of the koolari’s throat was grey flesh, wrinkled and spongy. Aside from the color, it didn’t look any different from the human throats Richter had cut into during Anatomy in med school. In addition to what he was expecting, though, there were three other structures that were most definitely a surprise. Three strings, about the thickness of cooked spaghetti, ran down the back of the monster’s throat. They were pure black and reflected the summoned light, giving them a slick appearance. Unable to help himself, Richter flicked one with his finger, and it vibrated like a violin string. Pling!



You have found:

Vocal Cords of the Winged Koolari.

Durability: 18/18

Item Class: Scarce.

Weight: 0.01 kg.

Traits: These cords can be woven together to make a strong string. The magical properties of songs could be augmented by an instrument strung with such a string. You feel the cords could also be used to make a potion to cloud men’s minds with madness for a short time. Alternatively, their shiny nature might be useful for making hooks to attract fish.





Richter’s brow furrowed. He was pretty damn sure that the scarce rarity wasn’t because it made the best fishing lures. The madness potion sounded promising, but it was the first quality that intrigued him. The chaos seed knew that there was power in music. Even on Earth, it could shape memory and create emotions. In The Land, the pixies used it to create tangible effects with their magic. The Playful Song of the Celestial Pixie he had heard prior to leaving the village had probably helped him resist the wail of the winged koolari. He hadn’t really thought about other uses of magical music, though.

Playing bard classes had never really been his thing. It had always seemed too passive for him. Having seen the power of the koolaris’ voices, though, Richter realized that he might need to rethink his previously dismissive stance. Staring at the shiny ebony cords, he decided that music would play a larger role in the Mist Village in the future. It was just too powerful of a tool to ignore.

Richter called over a few other guards and showed them what he was doing. There was not much time left before they started moving again, and he couldn’t harvest the vocal cords by himself. They lacked his skill in Herb Lore and so couldn’t harvest the vocal cords fully, but they could cut around the cords and hand him a large section of the monster’s flesh. After slowly cutting the vocal cords out and placing them in his bag, he had several guards watch while he repeated the process. Cautioning them not to damage the cords, he left his men to the harvest.

One of the guards asked if he could cut the wings free and keep them. Bemused, Richter looked at the wings, but they didn’t light up in his sight. Still, he said as long as it didn’t slow the warband down, he was fine with it. Part of him wanted to ask the man what he had in mind with the leathery membranes, but then again, part of him didn’t.

Hisako came up and examined the set of vocal cords he had harvested. Richter offered them all to her. He wanted to experiment with the dark strings, but there was no question that her spell had been the deciding factor in the battle. She smiled at him in appreciation and said that she would be happy to accept half of the harvested strings but no more. Richter nodded and told his guards to give the longest and thickest strings to the Hearth Mother. A few minutes later, all of the cords had been collected and distributed. Richter put the large chunks of koolari throat in his Bag. He would harvest the cords later.

Hisako cast a final Earth spell. It had a somewhat long casting time, and she had to continue pouring mana into it, but the bodies began to sprout plants and grass. It was slow at first, but rapidly picked up speed. After a minute, where the pile of bodies had been there was now a mound of new grass and small, blue flowers. The green light faded from her hands.

Hisako gave the contented sigh of a craftsman looking at a job well done and remounted her strike stag. The warband was back on its way.





CHAPTER 25 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG




The mood was more somber as they all walked, and everyone was on high alert for another attack. They moved as quickly as they could, none of them feeling good about having to continue through the forest in the dead of night. They didn’t stop, though. Yoshi’s War Leader skill still kept the party’s Fighting Spirit up, and despite the losses, they had won the battle.

The spell Hisako had cast to ensure the torches weren’t seen from a distance had been a great idea, but it did nothing to hide the light of the sprites’ imbued arrows or the flashes of magic during the attack. Yoshi said there was nothing to be done about it. They were still ten miles from the entrance to the hidden valley, and they would just have to hope that no scouts had spotted them. The trees were still thick around them, which greatly reduced the chances that their battle with the winged koolari had been noticed, but it was still a risk. They continued on.

Richter was proud of the fact that not one of his people suggested going back to the village. All of the guards were committed to protecting their new home. He spent about half an hour walking through the warband, clapping his men and women on the back and telling them how proud he was to fight beside them. The chaos seed wasn’t sure how much good it did, but he thought he saw a bit of tension ease on many of their faces.

After they had been walking for a few miles, Richter reached into his bag and mentally summoned the item he wanted. A smooth blue-white gem appeared in his hand. He withdrew his hand and opened it. From inside the jewel, a soft, blue-and-white light shone forth. It was weak, barely brighter than a night light, but easily seen in the dark. The light refracted off of the edges of the gem. While he looked at it, the glow shifted somewhat as if the light source was rotating slowly inside of the jewel. Richter held it cupped slightly towards his chest so the light wouldn’t give away their position. Fascinated by the light show, he reached his mind towards it, and a prompt appeared.

You have found: Psi Crystal. Durability: 10/10. Item Cl…

Before he could even finish reading, he was attacked from above.

*What is that, master? What is it? It’s so pretty! Can I have it? I love it! What is it? Why aren’t you answering?*

“Because you’re not even giving me a chance to think,” Richter said in irritation. Why was it all women liked shiny things? Alma sounded positively manic! The dragonling was firing questions at him so fast he didn’t even have time to think, and then getting mad at him for not answering. Yet another feminine trait he was not happy to find applied universally, independent of species.

Alma had swooped down from where she was flying above him as soon as she saw the white-blue light. That would not have bothered Richter so much, except for the fact that she had landed on his head! Alma was so eager to see what he had, that she hadn’t even been completely careful with her claws. Quick as a flash, she had climbed down his front and down onto his arm.

In fear of dropping the psi-crystal, he had closed his fist, which was the only reason that she hadn’t already taken it. Even now, though, she was prying at his fingers with her arms to get to the gem. He shook his arm trying to dislodge her, but she wrapped her tail around his forearm and held on, tight as a tick. When Richter started shaking more vigorously, she quickly turned and shot a blast of air into his eye. With a startled ‘Ehh!’ he reeled back and, in his surprise, opened his hand. The dragonling wasted no time grabbing the crystal and launching off of his arm with a squeal of delight. She hung in midair, her wings flapping to keep her aloft.

*I LOVE it, master. Is it for me? Is it? IS IT?*

Richter was half bemused, half annoyed. He had never seen her act like this before, barring a spat they had had when she had first been summoned. Alma was much more evolved than she had been then, though, and he had never seen her so enamored with something before. It was definitely a curiosity, but he decided it was still a good practice to nip bad behaviors in the bud.

With a steely tone, he thought to her, *Alma. As your master, I command you to give me that crystal. Now!*

She looked up from the blue-white gem and started to object, *But-*

*I said now, my familiar. Do not snatch things from me. Am I understood?*

Somehow putting a petulant look on her draconian face, she flew closer and dropped the gem into his hand.

*I was only curious,* she thought to him. Her tone was a particular blend of apology and rebuke.

Sighing to himself, he held out his arms. *I know, love. Why don’t you rest with me while we look at it together?* Immediately mollified, she flew to him and found a comfortable perch on his right forearm, while he held the jewel in his left hand. Richter turned his attention back to the crystal.

You have found:

Psi Crystal

Durability: 10/10

Item Class: Scarce

Level: 34

Weight: 0.9 kg.

Traits: This crystal is the captured psychic energy of a level 34 Winged Koolari. This energy can be utilized by Mental creatures to boost their growth and stats. The energy may also be used by anyone with access to Mental magic to greatly augment their spells. It can also be used by Mental creatures to augment their capabilities for a short time. Any usage will consume the energy all at once. Further uses of this energy may be possible and will have to be discovered.





Mental magic, Richter thought to himself. So far, he hadn’t come across any spells like that. Then again, he realized, that meant absolutely nothing. He’d been in The Land for less than a year. There were probably countless things that he hadn’t heard about yet. As he thought more on it, he realized that he wasn’t exactly naïve to Mental magic. He had a Mental resistance that increased every time Alma leveled her Psi Bond ability. Richter had always assumed that the resistance was just to overall psychic-type attacks, but maybe it was specifically geared towards this Mental magic.

Curious, he asked her. Then he asked her again. Finally, he had to close his fist to get the enraptured dragonling to pay attention to him. She was initially annoyed that he had taken her new favorite bauble away, but then she focused and decided to engage in her favorite past time, teasing him.

*Oh, master. How do you not already know this? You should never be ashamed to ask me for help when you cannot understand basic concepts.* Her mental tone was one of complete self-satisfaction.

Unamused, he sent her a mental image of him telling the village hunters not to feed her anymore.

Her eyes widened slightly, and she continued on in a less mocking tone, *My Mental resistance works in two ways: direct and indirect attacks. For direct attacks, I can almost never be harmed by a Mental assault. Any damage I receive will be reduced by 100%. If the mental energy directed at me is massive, I still might succumb, but I have not detected any beings with that level of psychic ability since we have been together, master.

The second method is to resist indirect attacks. If I were to fly through a field charged with dangerous psychic energy, for instance, my tolerance would be determined by my base ability to resist such energy. That base resistance is determined by multiple factors. Two examples are race and Willpower. My 100% mental resistance would increase my base tolerance by a factor of ten. At 65%, your base resistance to indirect mental attacks would be increased by more than a factor of six.*

*I thought that you were completely immune to mental attacks,* Richter thought to her.

*No master. Mental elementals are immune to psychic attacks, and, in fact, such attacks only make them stronger. I am nearly immune.*

Richter thought about what he had just learned. If he had a 50% resistance to Fire magic, he still wouldn’t think it would be a good idea to stick his hand into a furnace. From how Alma was explaining it, that would be an example of indirect damage. Someone hitting him with a Fire spell or enchantment would be an example of direct damage. What she said made sense, but that didn’t mean he liked hearing it. It meant that his resistances were not as powerful as he had thought. As with all things in The Land, it seemed like resistance came with its own checks and balances. Still, better to know that to not, he reasoned.

Richter opened his hand again and turned his attention back to the gem. When he brought it closer to his face, the light got brighter. Alma cooed. The rotation occurring inside the jewel also seemed to speed up a bit. Excited, he brought it all the way up to his face, but the glow went back to its previous level of shine and movement. Frowning slightly, he lowered his hand again. The light grew brighter.

Thinking he understood, he moved the gem closer to Alma and the light continued to grow more intense and the rotation more agitated until it looked like a mini disco ball. The dragonling, for her part, kept her eyes glued to the gem. Richter stopped just short of touching her with the psi-crystal.

*Pick it up, my love,* he thought to her.

Not needing to be told twice, she grabbed it with her small arms and held it to her chest. She half closed her eyes and crooned softly, clearly enjoying the presence of the psi crystal.

*Can you access the power inside of it?* he asked.

Alma opened her eyes. After a moment, she thought, *I think so, master. I think I could use it increase the strength of my Psi Blast or Brain Drain. Would you like me to try?* She sounded more than eager.

Remembering the prompt saying that augmenting her psychic abilities would use up the energy in one go, he quickly told her no and took the crystal back. He looked at it for a moment longer, then pressed it against her skin. A prompt appeared.

You have brought your Psi Crystal in contact with a Mental creature. Would you like to expend the energy to enhance your soul familiar? Yes or No?

He selected “Yes” and the light in the crystal stopped rotating. It focused into a beam that shone right on Alma’s face. Her jaws opened wide, and the beam narrowed into three distinct rays that led into her eyes and mouth. She drew a breath in, and the blue-white luminescence flowed out of the crystal and into her body in one large pulse. The crystal remained inert in his hand and Alma started to purr in pleasure. Another prompt appeared, and a feeling of satisfaction grew inside him.

Know This! Pure psychic energy can enhance the characteristics of your Psi Dragonling. Each level of your Psi Crystal equates to 1 Psi Points. Current Psi Points available: 34. Any unused Psi Points will be lost after 24 hours. At her current evolution, Alma has the following advancements available.

Despite the stress of the recent attack, Richter couldn’t keep a smile from creeping onto his face. He could upgrade his familiar now!

*Do you see this, love,* he asked her.

She kept crooning in pleasure with her eyes half-lidded, but still answered, *Yes, master.*

*This might change everything,* he thought to her excitedly. *I don’t want to just make these decisions for you, though. Do you want to invest your own points?*

She didn’t respond, but instead just continued to lay on his arms, purring slightly. Shaking his head at her, he tapped one finger on top of her scaled head. Alma cracked one eye and looked at him, *You are my master. I trust you. In the future, if I want to allocate my points, I will. Thank you for allowing that. You are a wonderful master. Right now, what I truly want is for you to stop bothering me, though.* With that, she closed her eye and started purring again.

Did she just-? Did that just happen? Part of him wanted to treat her like a shake weight, but ultimately, he chuckled at her sassiness. She truly was his soul familiar. He turned his attention back to the options.

Weak Psi Poison seemed awesome. It basically would start her down the path of being a mage killer. If the effects got stronger as he leveled the enhancement, it should be hard for any caster to be effective once the poison got into their system. Even a moment of lost concentration could cause a spell to miscast. It might even backfire. As much as he loved his own magic, he hated it when enemies pointed magic at him.

Yeah, the poison was tempting, but it also meant she had to get within striking distance of dangerous enemies. Her little body somehow had one hundred and thirty health points jammed within it, but that could be gone in an instant if she was hit with a nasty spell. Darkvision, on the other hand, might give her a decided advantage in battle. He could always cast that spell on her himself, though, and she could summon mist lights at will.

Chameleon definitely seemed cool. Her smoky grey body was already great for hiding at night and in shadow but was easily seen during the day. Also, her ability to hide was based on conventional eyesight. As Darkvision proved, there were varied methods that creatures used to detect others in The Land. Her dark scales would be next to useless as camouflage against a kobold. If she could truly blend into her surroundings, it would greatly increase her ability to do recon and strike from concealment. That was probably why it cost twice as much to buy that enhancement. He realized that, awesome or not, Chameleon would have to wait.

He didn’t even consider Natural Attack. Alma’s offensive abilities were rooted in her psychic and magical abilities, anyway. The conversions, on the other hand, were definitely interesting. Convert to Characteristic Points drew his eye. The fact that he could finally see Alma’s stats was awesome. She was the definition of “skewed.” Her Strength was a low “5,” but her Intelligence and Wisdom were higher than his. It wasn’t too surprising as her Psi Bond ability gave both of the later characteristics a 60% bump. It was still startling to look at how her size and species caused such a discrepancy. Alma could pack a serious punch, but with her low health, she was still extremely vulnerable.

Convert to Ability Points was helpful in an obvious way. The dragonling only received one ability point per level she obtained. As higher levels were harder to achieve and as her abilities required more points as they advanced, Alma’s advancement was stalling. These crystals were going to breathe life back into her development, he thought with a smile. He took a look at her status page.

Buying another ability point would cost ten of the thirty-four Psi Points he had to spend. He didn’t know how much buying a second one would cost, but if the cost only doubled, he could swing it. It meant he could upgrade any of her abilities except Brain Drain. As great as the experience was, though, he couldn’t have Alma just be a one trick pony. Also, when Brain Drain had reached level seven, it had gained the powerful new feature of capturing memories. If her other abilities “evolved” when they reached level seven, he was eager to see what else his familiar was capable of doing.

Looking at her status page helped him to confirm a decision he had been leaning towards anyway. His familiar needed to be protected. Richter switched back to Alma’s enhancement page and purchased Natural Armor I.

Total Psi Points Remaining: 24

Alma stopped relaxing on his arm and sat up. Blue-white light started to seep through her scales. Before Richter’s eyes, new scales grew out from the base of each of the old ones. They had a slight bit more sheen and appeared a bit thicker. The old scales fell away, and Alma’s weight increased slightly, causing Richter’s arm to dip.

The entire process only took seven seconds. She looked more or less the same, but as Richter examined her, he noted slight differences. The ridges over her eyes were slightly more pronounced, and her snout seemed slightly longer. Alma stood up on her hind legs and flapped her wings, crying out slightly to announce her more dangerous presence to the world. He could see that the leathery skin of her wings appeared slightly thicker and let less light shine through.

*Fly for me, my love,* he thought to her.

Alma jumped off his arm and soared into the air. She flew in a circle above his head and, at his prompting, flew as quickly as she could from one end of the warband to the other. When she was done, she landed on his arm again.

*Do you feel any slower?*

*I did at first, master. My body feels a bit heavier, but then I found I could flap a bit harder than before. When I got up to speed, I was going as fast as I normally do.*

Richter was slightly relieved. His one hesitation with upgrading her armor was a fear that it would slow her down. As a small aerial creature, speed and evasion would be more important to her survival than the thickness of her scales. It was only because he could offset any velocity loss by purchasing Flight Speed I that he had been comfortable risking it. He was happy to see that her enhancement wasn’t a double-edged sword.

Richter accessed her enhancement table, and saw that it had changed slightly to reflect his purchase.

Natural Armor II

Current Armor: 4

Increase the natural armor of your dragonling by +1

20





Richter made one more decision. It only cost four more points to upgrade her Psi Bond, and as far as he was concerned, they would be points well spent. The other factor that influenced his decision was his newly improved Enhanced Imbue Arrow skill. Increasing her Psi Bond increased the chances that his enemies would be afflicted with Mind Fog, Stun or Psi Crystallization. The chaos seed spent ten Psi points purchasing another attribute point and upgraded Psi Bond.

Total Psi Points Remaining: 14

You have chosen to increase your familiar’s ability: Psi Bond to level 6. Your familiar’s base innate intellect is increased by 125%. Her base Intelligence and Wisdom are also increased by 75%. Your mental resistance from Psi Bond has increased to 60%. Your familiar’s Psi Bond has advanced to being able to form a psychic connection even with those lacking the Psi Bond ability. You will also benefit from this stronger tie to your familiar. Your mental resistance from Psi Bond has increased to 30%. Maximum distance of communication increased from 1250 to 1500 yards. Tasks you once found mentally strenuous now come more easily. You have a greatly reduced risk of spell miscast. Factoring in your familiar’s Psi Bond level 6 and personal level of 37, add 22% to the chances of Mind Fog, Stun or Psi Crystallization occurring when you use Enhanced Imbue Arrow. Psi Bond has now advanced to the point that your mental connections with other creatures will enhance their intellect to a small degree. Other effects of this enhanced bond may be discovered in time.

Richter hadn’t been expecting the last part of the notification! Ever since bonding with Alma, there was a part of his mind that seemed like it had small lights in it. Each light was a psychic bond. The dragonling’s presence was like a bright sun, warm and reassuring. He had discovered, not long ago, that he could form a connection with his tamed pet as well. Casting Tame daily hadn’t leveled his Blood magic much, but the adder was a powerful pet. The bond to the snake was minor, more like a flickering candle, but it still allowed him to give the monster limited mental commands. As time went on, and his mental control had deepened, that candle had flickered less, but Richter still hadn’t seen any practical difference in his control of the shale adder.

Now, the candle was more like a flashlight. It was still nothing compared to his soul forged bond with Alma, but it was a noticeable difference. Richter wondered what “other effects” would develop in time. Looking at the adder, he thought, *Hi.* The snake just kept gliding along beside him. Richter turned his attention back to his familiar.

He wished he had more Psi points to spend, but he was still happy with what the psi crystal had added so far. The last thing he did was buy the badge that should maximize her chances to live through the upcoming battle. He bought Flight Speed I.

Total Psi Points Remaining: 4

A blue-white light suffused her body again. Her wings lengthened slightly, and the angles of her wing bones shifted. Even her face and tail became a bit more streamlined. Alma launched into the air, eager to put her new speed to use. Richter had used up all of her Ability points and most of her new Psi points, but she was also much stronger and better protected than she had been when he had started upgrading her. With the battle looming only hours in the future, he had a feeling she would need it.





CHAPTER 26 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Alma’s eyes sharpened and grew more intent after their Psi Bond was deepened. When she had first come into The Land, she had been little more than a feral animal: intelligent, but savage. Each new level she reached in Psi Bond had increased her awareness of the world and her place in it. Now she was smarter than most people he had met.

That thought made Richter chuckle a bit, but his levity was short-lived. He had taken his time debating Alma’s enhancements and several hours had passed since the koolari attack. According to his map, they were now only two miles from the entrance to the valley. He waved Yoshi over and told him. The sword adept just nodded and quietly passed an order. The warband came to a halt.

“Are you sure you want to come with us?” Yoshi asked the chaos seed.

“Let’s go,” was Richter’s only response.

Sion had walked up when the stop was called. Yoshi turned his attention to him, “And you are up for this as well? You never liked this part of your training.”

The meidon sprite nodded solemnly.

“Fine,” Yoshi curtly. “We leave in two minutes.”

Yoshi walked off again, leaving the two friends standing there. Sion checked to make sure his new elementum blade was clear in its scabbard and adjusted the position of his bow on his shoulder.

“What did he mean?” Richter asked.

His Companion was silent for a moment, then he sniffed harshly and cleared his throat. “You know about the hatred I felt for humans when we first met. I could have killed a human every day in open battle and never been bothered by it. There was one thing that I could not bring myself to do, however, despite the loathing I had for your race.” Sion looked him in the eye and said a single word, “Murder.”

Yoshi beckoned to the two of them, and then he turned and walked deeper into the forest. Ten other sprites followed him. Sion and Richter nodded to each other and started forward as well. Alma flew above, and Richter’s shale adder slithered along beside them.

The time for talk was done.

They left all light behind. Every member of Yoshi’s elite squad had enchanted strips of cloth with eyeholes that they wrapped around their faces that let them see in the dark. Coupled with their cloaks of concealment, it really nailed the whole ninja theme in Richter’s mind, but he kept that thought to himself. More important than their look, each and every one of the sprites was a Professional. The squad was comprised of Warriors, Rogues, and even one Mage. Yoshi offered Richter a strip of cloth, but the chaos seed simply cast Night Vision on himself, Alma and Sion. The three-hour duration of the Dark spell should be more than long enough for the dark deeds ahead.

Quietly, they ran through the forest. There was no talking. Just soft breathing and the softer sounds of their magically muffled footfalls. Richter was no sprite and did not possess the Woodcraft ability that gave his allies a supernatural connection to the forest, but he had his own powers. Between his months of training in the forest, his high Agility and Dexterity, and his Bracelet of Smooth Movement, he was a far cry from the noob that had crashed through trees only five months ago. Sion himself had said he was no longer a “stomper.” He moved at a slow run with the sprites, sliding through the thick trees, leaping over crevasses and smoothly avoiding brambles that would have snared him.

The squad covered the last two miles in just over ten minutes despite the difficulty of the terrain. Richter’s breathing was coming somewhat ragged, and his stamina had taken a serious hit, but it started refilling when they stopped. He regulated his breathing, and it started refilling a bit faster. Yoshi had held up one arm with a closed fist. All of the sprites had immediately stopped moving and had drawn and nocked arrows. None imbued their shots, however. This was a group trained to kill, not engage in battle.

Richter had followed their example and had an arrow at the ready, though he did not see what had caused Yoshi to halt their progress. The half-sprite cocked his head, listening intently. Almost faster than Richter could see, Yoshi moved to a tree and climbed into its canopy. Everyone waited quietly.

A few minutes later, the sword adept dropped back down to the forest floor. Barely a leaf rustled. He turned his body so that all of his men could see him, then moved his hands in a quick series of hand gestures. No glow surrounded his fingers. It wasn’t a spell. At, first, Richter was confused, but then to his shock and surprise, he understood what Yoshi was doing. It was sign language.

^Goblins. I see eleven sentries. Eight scout station. Three fighter station. Silent kills only. Be alert for unseen enemies.^

Congratulations! Your Gift of Tongues ability has unlocked a secret language: Sprite Hand Speak.

Richter’s eyes widened. His ability to speak, understand and write almost any language had come in handy time and again, though it required that he be exposed to that language first. It was one of the reasons he was eager to start seeing more of The Land, so that his ability could unlock more languages. He had never thought his ability might extend to forms of sign language, though.

Yoshi motioned for Richter and Sion to stay where they were. He started to turn to leave, and Richter was faced with a choice. He wanted to help, but the prompt had said that hand speak was a “secret” language. The adept was not the kind of person to look kindly on breaches of security. True, the Mist Village and the Hearth Tree were allies, but that might not mean too much to the half-sprite.

Richter also had to admit that it was tempting to keep his knowledge of the language to himself. It was the kind of knowledge that might come in handy in the future, even though the sprites were currently allies. On the other hand, Yoshi and his men were about to try and silently take out goblin sentries, and they were outnumbered. If even one of those goblins raised an alarm, the entire mission could fail. That meant the army wouldn’t get through the heavily guarded gap, let alone be able to attack the encampment itself.

To make matters worse, Yoshi didn’t even seem completely sure that he had spotted all of the sentries. Even if he had spotted all of the enemies, a third of the goblins were fighter station. Richter didn’t completely understand the differences in the goblin caste system, but one thing he did understand was that scouts were the weakest of the goblins, and that the stations got almost exponentially more dangerous after that. It wasn’t just scrubs that the sprites were about to go up against. The chaos seed knew that he could increase the strike team’s chances for success, but he would have to reveal that he had learned the secret language. The stakes were real, and the Richter only had a split second to decide what he would stand for.

He chose.

^Wait!^ he indicated in hand speak.

Yoshi’s face displayed more emotion that Richter had ever seen on it before. A murderous anger crossed his face, and his lips thinned in fury. His fingers moved to ask a single word.

^How?^

Hand speak was not conducive to long conversations, but Richter did his best. ^My ability. You trust me. I hold secret.^

Yoshi’s expression changed somewhat. He was still pissed, but he rolled his eyes showing some of that anger was focused on himself now. The adept had known about Richter’s Gift of Tongues ability, and he realized that he was to blame for the chaos seed knowing yet another sprite secret. The Warrior’s fingers moved again.

^Why stop us? Why show you know?^

Somehow the creepy half-sprite had guessed that Richter had been tempted to keep his knowledge to himself. The chaos seed decided to ignore the second question, and answer the first, ^Too many goblins. I help.^

Yoshi shook his head, ^Must kill silent.^

Richter had anticipated Yoshi’s argument and had issued a mental order. His shale adder silently rose up behind Yoshi and flicked its tongue out to lick the half-sprite’s face. The sword adept startled and grabbed his sword hilt before seeing what was behind him. He didn’t make a sound, but it was clear that he had been surprised. The adder’s scales were completely black now, showing that its nickname of “The Unseen Killer” was both apt and appropriate. No one laughed, but more than one sprite hid a smirk within their hoods.

^We kill silent,^ Richter signed with a firm expression on his face.

Yoshi stared at him for another moment, then simply nodded, ^Then see.^

Richter’s vision came alive with tactical data. It was similar to the information that Sion could give when he served in the Scout position in the war party. There was so much more, though. The chaos seed could immediately see the name, level, health, mana and stamina of everyone in the group. Even better, looking off into the forest, he could see red triangles hanging in the air. With a flash of excitement, he realized those must be the enemies. Yoshi also seemed to be able to toggle who had access to certain information, something that Richter couldn’t do at his current War Leader rank. The chaos seed couldn’t wait until he leveled the skill more.

Richter reviewed the new data he had; then a thought occurred to him. With a flexion of will, he accessed his interface. Sure enough, the tactical data that Yoshi had shared had been auto-updated on his map. Enemy positions showed up just as the adept had seen them. The closest was only two hundred yards away, and most looked to be clustered in groups of two to three. None of the red triangles were moving, however, showing that the information was still subject to the fog of war. It was only as good as the latest info they had, so the enemies remained in exactly the positions Yoshi had seen them in. Richter quickly pulled out the physical version of his Traveler’s Map and gave a mental order to Alma.

He showed Yoshi how the enemy positions were showing up and a faint smile creased the stern adept’s face. He waved everyone in and started to give kill orders to individual sprites, but Richter asked him to wait again. The adept nodded without complaint or question. Richter felt slightly honored that the half-sprite was putting faith in him. All of the other sprites went back to scanning the surrounding trees. Less than a minute later, what Richter had been waiting for happened. The triangles began to move.

A few of the red triangles jumped position. The goblins they indicated had moved since Yoshi had seen them. Even more important, Alma found hidden enemies. Two were perched in trees hidden by leaves and two more huddled deep in a bush. It was easy to see how Yoshi had missed them. Richter told her to fly around the areas two more times, but she couldn’t spot any further goblins. He had her hover above the area to continue giving real time updates.

Yoshi’s eyes had widened slightly at seeing the updated information, but the man was a professional, in both senses of the word. The Warrior wasted no time. He assigned Richter to the Scout position in his war party. The info that Richter received through Alma got a tactical upgrade. The enemies that Alma had spotted adopted red triangles, and even better, they now displayed tactical information. A small line extended from the triangles showing each goblin’s station and level.

The sword adept looked at the revised information and started handing out kill orders. This time, he included Richter and Sion in the attack. The basic plan was simple. Knots of enemies would have to be eliminated quickly and quietly, but also in a certain order. That way neighboring clusters would not be aware of the sprite’s presence until it was too late. After the adept was done communicating in hand speak, Richter provided one last addition to the plan: the vials of poison Tabia had given him.

As Yoshi read the stats of the Poison of the Muddied Leech, a brutal and wolfish smile grew on his face. The grin was so out of place on the adept’s stern visage that it might have been comical if it wasn’t so disturbing. It did answer one question for Richter though. He finally knew where Sion had learned the expression from.





CHAPTER 27 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter’s decision to help was noticed by more than just Yoshi and the sprites. The Universe apparently took note.

Congratulations! Your actions have reaffirmed your previous Quality. You are: Honorable. When faced with a potential personal gain, you placed the well-being of your allies above yourself. Your Quality is improved to Honorable II. Charisma bonus increased from +2 to +4. The previous 3% decrease in critical strike chance and critical strike damage is hereby negated. Be true to yourself to find your specific power.

Richter hadn’t even known that his qualities could be improved upon, but he would take it. He wished he knew how to unlock more of them, but as far as he could tell, they were only triggered in moments where he wasn’t making a conscious choice. They only seemed to appear when he reacted to reveal his core self.

His Resolute quality had occurred after his first death, when he had found the strength to face the horror of his rebirth. Implacable had appeared on his status page after he had saved Terrod despite knowing that he faced overwhelming odds. Finally, he had gained Honorable when he had a split second to decide between killing an enemy and saving an ally, in the sewers beneath Law. It was easy to see the corollary between that situation and the choice he had just faced.

One more prompt was waiting for him after he had finished speaking to Yoshi.

For being honest and improving his mission’s chance of success, you have gained 312 Relationship Points with Yoshi. Total Relationship Points: 2,574.

Congratulations! Your relationship with Sword Adept Yoshi has increased from Friendly to Happy.

Apparently, despite his initial anger, Yoshi appreciated either Richter’s honesty and what he was bringing to the table. Though “Happy” was still not the word that came to mind when Richter examined the adept. After the vicious smile had faded from the Warrior’s face, the half-sprite had gone back to his usual glare.

Richter handed the vials of poison out, and everyone began to prepare for the attack. Because the potion’s level was solution, each vial was sufficient to poison three arrow heads. The poison’s level determined how many arrowheads it could be spread on before losing potency. The number also equated to how many hits a melee weapon could make before it lost its poisoned status. Tabia had been clear that spreading the poison any more thinly risked making the poison too weak to be properly effective. The sprites applied the poison to three arrowheads each, and all of them kept another vial in reserve. Richter was twenty-four vials poorer, but their chances of success had just improved dramatically.

He and Yoshi had a hurried discussion in hand speak, and they decided on Richter’s targets: the two goblins hidden in the thick bushes. Their position made it extremely difficult to reliably hit them with arrows, and they were situated in the middle of a clearing. The lack of trees greatly reduced the sprites’ ability to move unseen as they could not rely on their Forest Concealment ability, but Richter’s Stealth skill still worked fine. The sky was only partially cloudy, but none of the moons were full. If he moved slowly, he should be able to approach their position undetected. After that, he would be able to use his Dark magic spell, Troubled Sleep, to render them unconscious. The two goblins were only scout station so their magical resistance should be fairly low.

There was a final goblin fighter positioned directly at the mouth of the pass. His role was obvious. If he heard anything, he was to run down the ravine, raising holy hell, and let the guard post know there was an attack. Yoshi asked if Richter’s pet snake could handle that. The adder lay in the grass not five feet away, but nearly invisible thanks to its camouflage ability. Richter nodded in assent but said it would take time for the snake to get there. The adept told him to get to it.

The chaos seed gave his pet a command and activated Stealth. He was a bit concerned the snake might not be able to follow his instructions, seeing as how the target was out of visual range. Their improved mental connection seemed to be working, though, because it just started sliding forward. The sprites activated their Forest Concealment ability, and they all moved off. Only Richter didn’t have his bow out and nocked. While his abilities as an archer had improved dramatically since coming to The Land, he was still no match for the sprites’ pinpoint accuracy. Anything less than a kill shot, or a silencing shot to the throat, was unacceptable.

Instead, Richter had his knife in hand, and the blade had been coated with leech poison. The white of the moonstone metal did not make it any easier for him to blend with the shadows, so he kept it hidden in the folds of his cloak. The strike team moved forward en masse towards the first knot of enemies. Three goblin scouts stood huddled in the lee of a large tree, doing their best to stay out of the cold night wind. The scouts were complaining softly in goblin-speak. If they had been paying more attention to their surroundings, they might have been able to do something about what was coming.

Three arrows sprouted from their faces. Two arrows found the eyes of two different scouts, and the third entered the mouth of the remaining goblin. That arrow punctured the soft tissue of his throat, traveling at hundreds of feet per second, and exited the back of his neck, having severed the brainstem. As the bodies started to fall, three other sprites rushed forward and caught them. There was no clatter of dropped weapons or final death rattle. There was only the sound of snapped strings and the ending of three lives. The bodies were left in darkness, and the strike force moved on.

The sprites split into groups of four and made for their designated targets. Sion went with Yoshi, leaving Richter to move forward alone. The shale adder had slithered ahead, having to cross a good distance to make its target. Richter reached the edge of the trees and crossed into the open.

He had never relied on Stealth for his very life like this before. When he had been running from the kobolds, he had hidden from time to time, but it had mostly been an exhausting flight through the wilderness. This was different. Richter moved slowly through the clearing, knowing that enemies were all around him. It kept going through his mind that one break in his concealment could cause his death, the deaths of his warband and would most certainly spell death for the captives they were trying to save.

Richter’s heart beat heavy in his chest, THUD-THUD, THUD-THUD. He tried to remain calm, mentally understanding that panic was not helping him, but his emotions did not listen, and soon his palms were drenched with sweat. As much as he wanted to cover the hundred yards to the bush quickly, he forced himself to move slowly and maintain his Stealth. All the while, he prayed that the clouds would continue to protect him from the moonlight.

Alma continued to fly above, sending him images. On his left, he saw four more goblins die, one of them a fighter. On his left, a strike squad planted two arrows in the face of a scout, and another into the throat of a fighter standing nearby. The fighter had time to reach out, but then the poison took effect, robbing him of his final health, and he dropped to the ground. The sprites positioned the bodies so they wouldn’t be conspicuous and moved on to their next targets. Richter kept edging forward.

The chaos seed’s heart started beating faster when the clouds shifted, and a shaft of moonlight illuminated the ground not ten feet from his position. It wasn’t too bright, but to him, it may as well have been a spotlight. The reddish-white light started moving towards him. For once, his luck was working against him.

A voice screamed in his mind to run, but the rational side of him said there was no time. He was in no man’s land, a hundred yards from the safety of the tree line and a still a hundred yards from the brambles the goblins were hiding in. The moonlight continued to move towards him, sneaking through the shifting clouds above. Richter slowly lowered himself to the ground, deciding to trust in the powers of his Cloak of Concealment. The rare item increased his concealment in any and all terrains. It was its universal application that made it so valuable.

Richter lowered himself into pushup position and then eased himself further down. A scant inch of space hung between the edge of his cowl and the ground. Richter saw the red light reach him and held his breath. His heartbeat sounded so loud in his ears, it didn’t seem possible that others did not hear it, but again, the rational part of him knew that was impossible. He kept his attention glued to his eye gauge.

Entering Stealth had made a closed eye appear on his internal interface. As long as the eye stayed closed, his concealment was preserved. If it opened… well, basically, he was fucked. Since reaching initiate rank in the skill, the eye had gained another feature. The black color had been replaced with a spectrum moving from green to yellow to red. Predictably, if the eye was green, there was little danger of being detected, yellow showed increased risk and red… well, basically, he was about to be fucked.

Since shrouding his figure, the eye had been closed and green. One time that he had stepped on a dry twig, the deep emerald green had lightened a bit, but after a few moments, it had returned to a dark green again. Now, however, in the light of Ignam, the Fire moon, the eye turned a sickly shade of yellow. Richter didn’t move a muscle. The yellow brightened to that of a ripe lemon as the moonlight covered his whole body.

It occurred to Richter that a moon thought to embody the Basic Element, Fire, most likely was not the best light to stay hidden in. Moments passed that felt like weeks. He closed his eyes, never taking his attention from the eye gauge. He just kept repeating a silent mantra, “Please god let it stay closed.” The light finally passed, and the eye gauge turned green again. Richter breathed a quiet sigh of relief and got back to his feet.

Now that he was safely ensconced in darkness, Richter moved towards his quarry again. In the minute that had passed while he lay exposed in moonlight, more red triangles had disappeared from his map, the knowledge of their deaths communicated through the magic of Yoshi’s War Leader skill. Only five remained. The two in front of him, the one his snake was moving towards, and a last pair that six of Yoshi’s men were stalking. Richter knew those goblins would not be long for the world. He focused on his task.

Alma obeyed his mental command and flew in low, and unseen, behind the goblins in the thicket. She landed softly, her dark scales blending nearly perfect with the ground. If his spell failed, her Psi Blast would be his back up. It was not an ideal choice, as her mental attack affected people differently. Some might be completely incapacitated, while others might scream their heads off. Still, better to roll the dice, than know for certain that his prey would raise the alarm.

Richter crept closer in a hunched position, circling a bit to the left of the bush. Once he crossed the final nut clenching fifteen feet, he softly breathed a word of Power and cast Troubled Sleep. A black glow surrounding his hands, but it was invisible in the night. As soon as the one second cast time elapsed, he moved forward quickly in case the goblins resisted his spell. He had nothing to worry about, his high Intelligence proved sufficient for the task. Both goblins were sound asleep. One kicked, as if pushing away a phantom attacker, and the other moaned softly. That was the one Richter killed first.

Not seeing any reason to waste the experience, he had Alma latch onto the goblin’s head. Immediately after, Richter plunged his dagger through the goblin’s eye and into the scout’s brain. Death was instantaneous. Alma growled softly as she fed on the bolus of mental energy. She quickly latched onto the other goblin, and her master ended his life as quickly as he had the first one. She purred in savage pleasure as she digested the two scouts’ memories, thought patterns and personas.

*Still hungry, love?* Richter thought to her.

*Always, master,* was the bloodthirsty reply.

*Good. Go fly above the final goblin. When the adder attacks-* Richter’s communication was interrupted by something unexpected.

An image came to his mind of a nighttime scene. He could see a goblin looking about with unease on his face. Behind him was the pass leading to the guard post. Along with the image came a question. There were no distinct words, but Richter still understood the message, “Now?”

With a smile, he realized that his tamed shale adder had sent him an image of what it was seeing, just like Alma. The Psi Bond prompt had described a boost to his pet’s intelligence and their mental connection. If this was how it manifested, Richter wasn’t disappointed. He was surprised, though. The snake was smart enough ask for permission now. That had to be at least a couple of evolutionary steps forward by Richter’s estimation. Then he realized, maybe not. The chaos seed had assumed that because the snake was a beast, it must be dumb, but it had always been smart enough to follow his commands even before the increase in Psi Bond.

All of his musings were academic, though. Right now, he had to deal with the final enemy. The goblin was of the fighter station, and from the expression on his face, had picked up on the fact that something was wrong. The fighter hadn’t raised an alarm yet, so he wasn’t sure, but Richter knew it was only a matter of time. The goblin was only seconds from raising the alarm. It was really too bad for him that the adder was only five feet away.

*Kill him,* Richter thought to his pet with sadistic satisfaction.

The image zoomed in so quickly that it startled Richter, and then it started tilting crazily. He realized the adder had struck and was now rolling to entomb the goblin in its coils. The fighter’s life was over; he just didn’t know it yet.

Richter smiled at Alma, *If you’re still hungry you better hurry. I don’t think my pet snake is going to wait much longer.*

The dragonling shot into the air, winging towards the adder. She took full advantage of her new speed in the hope that she would be able to capture the goblin’s psychic energy before it died. Richter sent a group thought to both of them, telling them to play nice, and then started walking towards the icon on his map that showed Yoshi’s position.

The strike force was once again huddled around Richter’s map. One of the sprites had been sent to communicate with the main army. They were waiting for Hisako, and the rest of their forces, to come and take up positions around the entrance to the ravine. They had also collected the goblin bodies. Only a few paltry coins were found, along with some low-quality weapons. They also found several horns, one for each grouping of goblins, presumably used to signal if there was any danger.

Richter had sent Alma to fly ahead, and the dragonling was doing some necessary reconnaissance. The ravine was only about a mile long, but it zigzagged for most of its length. The longest straight stretch was only about two hundred yards long. Unfortunately, that was the area directly in front of the guard station situated at the end of the ravine.

Only a few seconds after Alma had left, four red triangles had appeared on the map, and all of their breath caught in their collective throats. The dots were only half the distance up the ravine. They all shared the same thought. That they had been detected by unseen goblins, who were even now hurrying to warn the rest.

Thankfully, they were worrying for nothing. Alma showed them that they were still maintaining zero presence. The patrol was comprised of four fighters and two scouts who were casually strolling down the ravine while they conversed in goblin-speak. Richter relayed what he had seen to the other sprites, and they realized how lucky they had all been. The goblins apparently had a patrol traveling up and down the ravine. If their timing had been wrong, the patrol might have arrived to see the final goblin being killed. They could all see signal horns on the goblins’ belts.

The point was, their luck had held. Barely. Without a word, Richter drank a Potion of Selak’s Luck. For the next three hours and forty-nine minutes, his Luck stat would be increased from twenty-one to fifty-three. After almost getting exposed by the Fire moon and now only having avoided being detected because the goblin patrol was lazy and lackadaisical, he really felt like he’d used up whatever luck he’d started the night with. Besides, like his granddaddy used to say, “Better lucky than ugly, but better lucky with ugly than alone.”

Alma continued to relay information to Richter, who in turn updated his map for all to see. She clung to the shadowy sides of the ravine, staying concealed and protected. Richter zoomed the map in so they could see what they were up against.

The goblin encampment may have only been half-completed, but they had taken the time to fortify the end of the pass. A ten-foot high wall of logs had been buried in the ground. It covered the entire twenty-yard width of the ravine exit. The top of the wall was irregular, according to the original height of each tree. The logs had been fit together closely enough that no one could pass between them, but there were still gaps large enough to see through. A crosswalk had been erected behind the top of the wall, and three goblin fighters stood atop it holding bows.

The bottom of the wall didn’t have a proper gate, just a five by five square hole cut out of the center. The goblins had also driven logs into the ground at a forty-five-degree angle facing away from the opening to the gate. The purpose was clear. The logs wouldn’t be a danger to anyone walking towards the gate, but it prevented a large force from simply barreling ahead. The defenses the goblins had erected were crude but effective. Two goblin scouts waited just inside the gate, armed with iron spears.

Alma flew over the wall, staying to the shadows and saw that the forest on the other side of the wall had been partially denuded. The goblins hadn’t needed to go far to get the wood for their defenses. Immediately behind the wall were five campfires with a total of thirty-nine scouts and goblins. Many of them were asleep and snoring, but more than a few were awake. Most of those still conscious seemed to be either half-drunk or fully slammed, but still, the group greatly outnumbered the strike force. The only saving grace, was that the goblin campfires were fairly spread out and trees and rocks blocked line of sight between the fires. Alma flew through the trees and into the grassland beyond, but could not detect any more enemies. That was a small amount of good news, but as far as Richter was concerned, she had already sent along enough bad news to ruin his whole day.

Yoshi had him zoom in on certain areas, and double check with Alma to ensure no patrols were on the way to augment the guard post. As far as Richter could see, there was no way to get close enough to take the goblins out silently. They might be able to get close enough to get kill shots on the three goblins atop the wall, but the shots would have to occur almost simultaneously. He also knew from experience that firing up at a target was definitively harder than getting a kill shot when you had the high ground.

Even if they could bag those three goblins with silent kills, and even if the fighters didn’t fall off of the narrow walkway, that still left the two scouts that were taking cover behind the gateway. There were no clear shots without getting close enough to be spotted. He was about to bring these concerns up when Yoshi took a step back and addressed his men. His message was simple and monosyllabic, “Claws.”

Yoshi’s men had apparently undergone varied and extensive training. Richter was initially confused by the sword adept’s statement, but his meaning became clear soon enough. Every member of the strike force reached inside their cloaks and pulled out a pouch. The chaos seed watched as Yoshi’s second in command, Damien, pulled out a band of metal that was the same green hue as their sprite armor. Damien slid four fingers through the band until it wedged into place over his gauntlet. A second band went over his other hand.

Two straps hung to either side, and the fighter quickly used them to tie the bands securely into place. On the inside of each ring of metal, were the “claws.” Four “L” shaped spikes were situated on the bands, pointing towards the sprite’s wrists. Richter could see how a strong tug could dig the spikes into a surface and keep the sprite secured. Still…

“Don’t tell me you’re planning to scale the ravine wall,” he said. “Those ‘claws’ of yours have to be great for climbing trees, but how do you expect to use them to climb stone?”

Yoshi motioned to Damien with a headshake, “Show him.”

Damien smiled and walked over to a nearby rock, “Never underestimate a sprite.” He dragged his claws across the stone. There was a strange and faint hissing sound, not at all like the screech Richter expected to hear from dragging sharp metal across rock. Damien moved his hand out of the way, and Richter saw four distinct grooves in the rock. Shocked, Richter ran his finger over the furrows and found them to be smooth. There wasn’t even any dust. The chaos seed turned back to the grinning sprite and activated his Talent, Identify Enchantments II.

You have found:

Sprite Claws of Sublimation

Durability: 42/45

Item Class: Unusual

Quality: Superb

Weight: 1.4 kg

Traits: Activating the enchantment in these gauntlets will cause most forms of common rock to turn to gas

Charges: 253/257





“I… WANT… ONE!” Richter said. These things were amazing! If he could find a way to learn this enchantment, the possibilities were endless. Watch out Tokra, he could make insta-tunnels too! What if he could apply the enchantment to a pick axe? The productivity of his ore gatherers would sky rocket!

“These are not trinkets to just be given out,” Yoshi said severely. “They are only given to those who have undergone the Uddo Rengai.” Then his face softened somewhat, while somehow a cruel glint found its way onto his face. “You have proven yourself to be a trustworthy person, however, and I am happy to call you an ally. Perhaps you would like to undergo this training once we are done with this little task. In fact, I strongly recommend it.”

You have been offered a Quest: Uddo Rengai I. Your relationship with sword adept Yoshi has progressed to the point that he has offered to let you undergo a secret form of sprite training. Your Gift of Tongues ability translates this as ‘Trial of the Wood Spirit.” From his tone and phrasing, it is clear that refusing this training, would be unwise for your relationship with him… and possibly for your health. Reward(s): A set of Sprite Claws of Sublimation. Other unknown benefits from training. Penalty for Failure to accept or complete this Quest: Loss of relationship rank with Sword Adept Yoshi. Do you accept? Yes or No?

“Uhhh, I’d be honored?” Richter responded. It was half question half answer.

“Yes,” Yoshi said as if Richter’s answer had been a foregone conclusion. “Back to the matter at hand. My team will scale the ravine walls and cross over the top of the wall. From that side, with the help of your leech poison, we will be able to kill all of the goblins on this side of the wall. You and Sion must remain behind.”

“Look, I know I haven’t undergone your trial yet, but I can climb. Sion here is like a monkey. Just give us a spare set of the claws, and we’ll help. I promise I’ll give them back after.”

“No, battle sergeant,” Yoshi said. His use of Richter’s War Leader rank made the chaos seed pay close attention. It was almost like half-sprite was showing him respect. “I no longer doubt that you were a valuable addition to this squad, but you do not know how to move laterally across stone while ensuring that not a single pebble falls to tell of your passage. You would put us in danger. Also, you have your own battle to fight.”

Yoshi looked at him and meaningfully tapped the red dots still in the ravine. Richter understood immediately, “The patrol.”

“Yes,” the adept said nodding. “It will take my squad some time to scale the cliff and move past the gate. Those four goblins will make it back here before we can kill all of the gate guards. If they see their guards missing, they will raise the alarm. You and Sion need to kill them before the patrol gets suspicious. Richter, you have proven yourself an able warrior. I can leave members of my strike team to help you if necessary, but that will greatly decrease our chances to kill the gate guards quietly. Waiting for the rest of the army to come is not an option. If the patrol gets to the end of the ravine and sees their sentries gone, they will raise the alarm, and the mission will fail. Similarly, if you cannot silence the patrol all at once, and they raise the alarm while we are still climbing. While we are climbing, we will be vulnerable, and many of us will die. Speak true, Lord Richter. Can I trust you to kill the patrol quietly?”

Quest Update: Bloodstone I. The success of the mission rests upon you. Yoshi is confident that his strike force can kill the gate guards despite being outnumbered. The patrol of four goblins is already returning, however. You must kill them quietly. Yoshi will leave you extra men to help, but that would endanger his half of the attack. Penalty for Failure: The possible death of Yoshi’s entire strike force and failing the Quest. Can you and Sion kill the goblin patrol quietly? Yes or No?

Richter didn’t hesitate. A great many things had changed since he had come to The Land, but his ability to make a split-second decision when it was required was not one of them. “Those goblins are going to die, and I’m going to be the one that kills them.”

Yoshi extended an arm, and Richter reached out as well. The two clasped wrists and met eyes. Then, with a firm shake, the adept let go and told his men to move out. Alma flew back over the ravine. The patrol was still moving towards the gate, so the strike force started jogging down the crevasse as well. The more ground they could cover before starting to climb, the better.

The claws were amazing, but it looked like they burned through the magic of the enchantment fairly quickly. Based on what Richter had seen, the claws might only have about five minutes of continuous activation time before the charges ran out. A quick round of questioning showed that none of the sprites had the enchantment skill, which meant that they couldn’t use soul stones to replenish the charges. Damien assured him, though that they were trained for these types of scenarios.

They traveled half way down the ravine, and then the strike squad began its ascent. The sprites were natural climbers. Augmented by the magic in their gauntlets and even more so by the climbing spikes, they were able to move upward at the speed of a slow walk. Within a few minutes, they were several dozen yards up, and if not for the Night Vision spell, Richter and Sion wouldn’t have been able to see them. True to Yoshi’s word, not a single pebble fell to give away their passage.

Richter, Sion, and the shale adder continued forward. They had chosen a switchback in the ravine as their ambush point. The snake’s scales had already changed to match the grey rocky ground it was slithering over. The location they had chosen had several small boulders that should still be large enough for the cloaked Companions to hide behind. They found their positions and began to prepare.

Both men anointed arrows with leech poison. When Richter viewed the arrows in his virtual inventory, a small green teardrop icon appeared next to them. The poison status would not last long, but it would remain long enough for them to spring their trap. With that thought, the chaos seed reviewed the traps in his Bag to see if they could help.

He had a shrink trap still left in his bag from earlier adventures, but all of his dart traps had been used. The only other traps had come from the assengai queen’s lair: Tranquilizing Web Trap, Acidic Web Trap, Constricting Web Trap and Razor Web Trap. Richter shook his head, they were all potentially powerful, but none of the traps ensured instant kills or incapacitation. Killing the goblins would have to come down to their magic and fighting skills.

Richter loaded his Ring of Spell Holding. The enchanted band couldn’t hold any of his new initiate level spells, but it would still prove its worth. He started a casting, and the clear gem on the ring turned black. Checking the video feed from Alma, he saw that the goblins had started coming back down the pass…and there were two more coming with them.

He looked at Sion, with a pensive look in his eye. The sprite looked back and adopted a resigned expression when he saw Richter’s face, “What? What now?”

“Welllll…” Richter cleared his throat, “It looks like there are now eight goblins coming with the patrol now; five fighters and three scouts.”

“What?” Sion hissed quietly. “You said six!”

“It was six!” Richter shot back through gritted teeth.

“Then why is it eight now?”

“How the fuck should I know?”

The two friends bickered quietly for a few more seconds, until Richter said, “Look. This is happening. Now let’s plan.”

The chaos seed took his map out and zoomed in so they could see the goblins. The good news was, through Richter’s position as Scout in Yoshi’s war party, he could see that all of the goblins were level sixteen and below. The highest level goblin they had encountered so far had been level twelve. Apparently, the lower level goblins had been given the shit detail of doing scout duty outside the ravine. That didn’t mean they weren’t dangerous, but at least their stats shouldn’t be near the superhuman levels that Sion and he had. Richter hoped that the trend of the goblins getting stronger didn’t hold true, though. Otherwise, the encampment might be full of high level enemies.

Another stroke of luck was that the green-skinned fighters were moving as slowly coming back down the canyon as they had going up it. It gave the strike squad more time to reach the far side of the gate, while also giving the Companions time to prepare. They gave names to each of the goblins to better assign targets. The fighters were: Big Nose, Scar, Rash, Rash Two, and Ugly Face. That last guy was ugly even for goblin. The scouts were Yellow Wart, Cross-eyed, and Bill. Richter looked in askance at his friend over the last name.

“I grew up with a sprite named Billari. He was a total asshat.”

Proud of his friend’s improved usage of swear words since they had met, Richter just nodded and said, “Nice.”

The Companions watched as the patrol got closer, and saw that the goblins stayed in roughly the same configuration. Four fighters walked in back, another walked slightly ahead, and the two scouts walked a couple of yards back. Only three, two fighters and a scout, had horns on their belts. They were the first targets.

The plan was to let the patrol pass by and then Sion would attack from behind. Once the goblins’ attention was turned towards the sprite, Richter, who would be stealthed just ahead of the patrol, would attack. The Companions had preparation, surprise, superior weaponry, magic and levels on their side. The goblins only had numerical superiority. The ambush should work, but Richter had learned that nothing was sure in battle.

None of the goblins with horns were wearing helmets, which greatly increased the chance of making an instant kill. In fact, each goblin only wore a random collection of metal and leather armor. Most of it had holes in it, showing how the previous owner had died. All of it was rusted in places. Their weaponry was in a similar state, ranging from a wooden cudgel to a rusted mace. Sion would take out one of the horn blowers with a poison arrow to the neck or head. Hopefully, with his insanely high attack speed, the sprite could strike a second target before the goblins even knew what was happening. The adder could be relied on to incapacitate another fighter. The rest were going to be the responsibility of Richter and Alma. It might have been too much, if not for the fact that Richter was a summoner.

Despite what he had thought earlier, the chaos seed slipped his Ring of Healing off of his finger and donned the Ring of Dominant Will he had taken from the Witch Doctor’s body. With what was coming, he had a feeling that he would need the +21% that the ring provided to his ability to control other creatures.

Alma flew above and behind the goblins, unseen and ready to attack. Once Richter saw that the goblins were only a few hundred yards away, he started casting. Sion stood in front of him and spread his cape, ensuring the magical light couldn’t be seen down the canyon. Richter moved both arms as he dual cast the spell for the first time. Green light surrounded his hands, and he cast Summon Minor Chokespore Arachnid.

A four-foot tall green disc appeared in the air, and a dry smell like fallen leaves filled the air. It was faint but distinctive. From the disc, a hairy, segmented leg emerged, and then another. In a few seconds, the entire spider had come through from whatever plane he summoned it from.

The thing was only three feet high. Its furry bod was a mix of green and brown in a pattern that would provide great concealment in a forest. Most of its body looked like any other spider, albeit much larger, but its abdomen was pockmarked with dozens of silver dollar sized holes. Despite the fact that it was a higher level than the saproling he could summon, summon, Richter was disappointed in his new creature. Until he used Analyze.

Name: Chokespore Arachnid Disposition: Loyal

Chokespore arachnids are agile hunters. Rather than trapping creatures in webs, this forest hunter quietly creeps closer to its prey. Once in range, it jumps into the middle of a pack of creatures and releases the fungus stored in its abdomen. These spores shoot into the air and causes severe allergic reactions in most creatures. Effects include closing of airways, extreme blurred vision, and intense pain, making concentration difficult. After its victims are incapacitated, it quickly bites its quarry causing a short-term paralysis. This is still long enough for the spider to wrap the bodies in strong spider silk to be consumed at its leisure.

The spider might be just what they needed. Richter had been planning to summon a saproling as well, but he realized that in this case, less was more. It wasn’t worth the two Earth creatures possibly exceeding his control. He quickly told Sion about the creature’s capabilities, and the sprite agreed that it should jump into the middle of the patrol once the fighting started and release its spores. Richter accessed the faint light in his mind that showed his Psi Bond with the spider. He tested a few commands and was pleased to see that it moved as he directed it. The best surprise was it could scale the walls and attack from above. Richter had it climb the ravine wall several feet away from the switchback and wait.

Looking at the spider, Richter realized that he couldn’t assume that higher level creatures were necessarily better than his lower level creatures. The arachnid’s main attack involved getting its prey to breathe poisonous spores. That meant the spider was only useful against corporeal creatures that, well, breathed. Against undead enemies, the spider might be next to useless. His saproling however, could probably go toe to toe with zombies of the same level.

On the other hand, even a patrol of goblin scouts had been enough to overwhelm his saproling in the past. His new spider, though, might make short work of such a squad if they all inhaled its chokespores. It was just another example that in The Land, it was the correct application of power that mattered, not power in and of itself.

As he prepared to cast his next spell, he drank a mana potion. It was a luxury having a surplus of the blue solutions, and he spared a moment to think fondly of his Dragon’s Cauldron and Tabia. Then he turned his attention back to the matter at hand. His mana bar began to replenish, restoring the three hundred and twenty-seven magic points he had lost dual casting Summon Minor Chokespore Arachnid. Thankfully, his next spell was not nearly as mana intensive.

A guttural word of Power flowed over Richter’s lips as he cast Summon Weak Bile Rats. A purple-black disc appeared on the ground, and five rats rose from the portal before it disappeared. Each of the rats was a sickly yellow color, despite the fact that their bodies were fat and thick. They were each level five or six. Richter put them through their paces as well and was satisfied that they would follow his commands. He wasn’t able to command each rat individually. It was more like he was psychically commanding a hive mind and they all obeyed. Richter was tense for a moment, this being the first time he had successfully summoned two creatures at once, but both the rats and the spider remained completely under his control. Whether because of the ring or because they were from different elements, his creatures, remained obedient.

*The stinky ones approach, master,* Alma sent.

*We’re ready love. Psi Blast any of them that don’t immediately go down, even if Sion or I get trapped in the blast.* Richter hadn’t told his friend about that last part. Hopefully, it wouldn’t come up, and if it did, he was sure the sprite would get over it. Eventually.

Sion and Richter cast a series of spell buffs. Then the sprite hid himself and Richter did the same. The trap was set, so Richter sent the bait. From what he had seen in the past, goblins were not picky eaters. They seemed to think that rats were a particularly tasty treat. Richter sent the rats forward, around the switchback and towards the goblin patrol. Once the goblins saw the rats, one gave an excited whoop, and the rest squealed in delight. They started speaking quickly in goblin-speak, “Get them.” “Get them!” “I was just thinking I was hungry.” “Those elf-loving bastards scraped the cook pots clean before I even got any dinner!”

Richter ordered the rats to flee back towards him, and through Alma’s eyes, he saw them run after the rats. Not wanting to be confused by dual images, he shut down the visual feed Alma was sending and prepared for battle. The first goblin came around the corner. Then the next, and then the next. None of them spared a glance towards where Sion hid on the left side of the canyon. Neither did they see Richter along the right side, hidden by cloak, stealth and the dark of night.

As soon as the last one passed Sion, the meidon sprite attacked. The sides of his cape fell back, and he drew his already nocked bow. He exhaled and released. The arrow, point brown from being covered in poison, flew true. Its broadhead point entered the back of a goblin fighter’s head, and the green-skinned creature pitched forward. Sion was already sighting on his next target before the first began to drop.

The shale adder, nearly indistinguishable from the rocky makeup of the ravine, shot forward. The first thing the goblin fighter saw of the creature that would end his life was a gaping maw moving towards his face. The snake downed its prey and began coiling its body around the goblin. The fighter managed a short, shrill scream, but the sound only went down the pet’s throat. The adder began squeezing.

The goblins started to turn back, and Richter attacked. What the goblins had just taken to be a patch of rock revealed itself as a deadly enemy. The chaos seed extended his hand, and his fingers formed the tactile portion of the spellform while a guttural word of Power spilled from his lips. Only two seconds after Sion launched his arrow, Richter cast Troubled Sleep.

Two scouts dropped to the ground immediately. The spell’s five-foot area of effect also let him hit the third scout and the fighter trailing them. The two goblins resisted the spell and started turning towards Richter. The chaos seed didn’t give them time to respond. Richter raised his other hand and released the spell stored in his Ring of Spell Holding. This time, both the fighter and scout dropped.

The remaining three goblins started to shout, and one still had a horn on his belt. They knew they probably wouldn’t make it out of the ravine alive, but seeing their racial enemy whipped them into a fury. Even if their lives would end, they would sound the alarm out of loyalty and spite, sure that their fellows would chase down the sprite that had killed them. That was the plan anyway.

Sion’s second arrow took another goblin fighter in the chest, missing an instant kill due to the goblin dodging to the side. The goblin with the horn was raising it to his mouth, and the last had raised his sword to attack, when the chokespore arachnid entered the fray. The spider jumped off of the wall it had been hanging on and landed in the middle of the three goblins. Both Richter and Sion pulled back. They intentionally breathed out, resisting the reflex of inhaling while they held their breath. The spider landed, and thousands of tiny spores shot out from its abdomen with a soft pfft. To Richter and Sion, it looked like a sphere of brown dust just suddenly appeared around the summoned creature

The goblin Sion had wounded went down first. He was in the process of starting to scream, and he took a large breath of the spores. His throat immediately became inflamed and swollen. A spasm caused the fighter’s already narrowed airway to momentarily snap shut. The goblin dropped to his knees, clawing at his own throat.

The other two got a smaller dose, but it still spelled their end. They coughed involuntarily to try and expel the offending spores, but that just triggered a compensatory reflex of inhaling deeper once the cough had passed. That caused a second, stronger cough and another resultant inhale. The cascade continued until they fell to the ground, killed by their bodies own attempts to survive. It took a few more seconds, but they still dropped to the ground, struggling to take in even the smallest of breaths.

In less than ten seconds, the patrol was down. After a mental command from Richter, the arachnid started biting each of the goblins to ensure they would stay that way. Alma had already latched onto the head of the goblin that the adder was squeezing to death. With a loud crack, the goblin’s neck broke, and the snake began to loosen its hold.

The cloud of spores stayed in the air for about fifteen seconds before it began to settle. A minute later, it was safe to walk through the area again. Sion took his sword out and was preparing to deliver the coup de grace, when Richter stopped him.

The sprite looked up and was somewhat taken aback by the hungry look on his friend’s face. Richter smiled and said, “I need them.”

Alma flew over to a paralyzed goblin. The creature’s breaths were still coming short and fast, and his eyes were pained. Sion’s arrow might not have been fatal, but from the position, it had most likely punctured a lung. He wasn’t long for the world, but the goblin still tried to eek out every last gasp out of life. As the dragonling latched onto his head, though, his eyes reflected more than pain. They showed fear as well.

Richter leaned over the green-skinned fighter and realized it was the one he and Sion had named Scar. The chaos seed wasn’t sure if the paralyzed goblin was pleading with his eyes as his raised his dagger, but then, it didn’t really matter. Richter plunged the white blade into the fighter’s chest. Black blood shot from the wound, covering the weapon and Richter’s hand. A sharp yank later, the goblin was fully gutted, and Alma got her meal. The dragonling detached from the goblin and moved onto the next.

Sion watched his friend feed goblins to his familiar with mechanical efficiency. Alma would clamp onto a goblin’s head with a hiss of hungry pleasure, and Richter would stab it to death. There was no cruelty in it, but no pity either. It wasn’t until they got to the last scout, that Richter looked up with a playful smile on his face.

“Hey Sion, I think this one is Bill. Do you want to take it out?”

Sion smiled back and just shook his head. Richter shrugged and plunged his dagger down. The whole white length of the blade was smeared with black now, and small gobbets of flesh were caught on the pommel. The chaos seed gave a final twist to the blade and the last goblin died.

Sion watched his Companion butcher the goblins with a detached respect and a small amount of pleasure at seeing his racial enemies killed. As Richter had continued the slaughter, though, the pleasure faded, and another feeling twinged inside of him. Without even recognizing what he was doing, Sion squashed that emotion and focused on remaining detached. Even if he had paid heed, though, the sprite could never have admitted to himself, that for just a moment, he had been afraid of his best friend.

Total War Points: 51.

None of the goblins transmitted memories along with the Brain Drain. Richter wasn’t complaining. He was twenty-seven thousand points closer to paying off his experience debt! He didn’t second-guess his decision to spend his XP to buy Talent points. The enchantments he had made would most likely save the lives of his people today. Still, it would be nice to increase his stats with some good ol’ fashion leveling.

When he had just been playing games, he had always enjoyed being a jack of all trades. The increasing costs of spells, though, showed him that if he was going to take his magic seriously, he was woefully underprepared as far as his mana pool went. Richter had to imagine the same was true for his martial skills. Bottom line, he might need to level again before he bought more Talent points.

The goblins didn’t have much in the way of usable items. A few copper pieces, one or two silver, and a collection of low-quality weapons and armor. He and Sion jogged back down the ravine to join the rest of the warband. They left the bodies in a pile. Alma had flown back towards the end of the pass, almost drunk on the psychic energy she had consumed. She confirmed that no one at the gate looked alarmed, and no other goblins were coming down the ravine. The dragonling also agreed to help Yoshi now that the ambush was over. Alma gave an update on the strike team’s position. They were thirty yards up and had covered more than half the remaining distance to the guard post.

Richter and Sion quickly reached the end of the ravine and looked around. To the sprites’ credit, he couldn’t see them at first, but soon they seemed to phase into being out of the surrounding woods. Hisako walked up.

“Where is Yoshi?” she asked.

Richter clued her in on what had transpired. To her credit, the strong-willed woman just listened without interrupting. There was no a sigh of relief when she heard that the patrol had been taken out and neither was there a gasp of concern when she heard what Yoshi’s team was about to do. No one who met the powerful woman would ever make the mistake of thinking her weak-willed. She was an experienced leader and knew when to put her faith her in her people. After his report, she succinctly said, “Then we wait.”

It turned out; waiting was harder than anything else Richter had done that night. His own soldiers were stationed further away from the ravine than the sprites were. Lacking the Forest Concealment ability, his guards couldn’t risk being seen if goblins had come back down the pass. He jogged over to them. Terrod and Caulder walked up to meet him.

“Are you well, my lord?” the captain asked.

“Yes,” Richter replied. “How are the men? Report.”

Caulder spoke up and said they were ready, “All of the guards seem alert. They are ready to fight for you and their morale is high.”

“Good,” Richter said with a nod. He took some extra health and stamina potions from his bag. “Hand these out to any of our people who had to use their potions during the koolari attack.”

“It will be done, my lord.”

The two started walking off, but Richter reached out a hand, and they stopped. He took out the Belt of Agility he had taken from the Warrior the day before and handed it to Terrod. Just like Caulder’s had the day before, the captain’s eyes widened in shock. Before he could speak, Richter cut him off, “Don’t bother protesting. You deserve it. Use it well.”

For your generous gift, you have gained 311 Relationship Points with Terrod. Total Relationship Points: 28,186

The captain nodded gratefully and walked off with Caulder to take care of the troops. Richter decided to take a moment to do the same. He spoke with his villagers and joked lightly with them when possible. Many of the men and women were nervous, but they still met his eye. That was enough.

An hour later, he received word from Alma. The guard post had been pacified. Their army remained undetected. Richter gave an order, and Terrod and Caulder got the guards moving. Sion took charge of the meidon sprites. Together with Hisako, they all marched down the ravine, each secretly hoping to see the sun rise once more.





CHAPTER 30 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The army approached the guard post cautiously. Torches still burned to either side of the gate, and after marching in darkness for hours, entering a field of light made Richter feel exposed. Damien, Yoshi’s second in command, came out of the gate though and waved them through. As the army passed through the gate, Damien walked towards them.

“Greetings, Hearth Mother. The guard post has been secured. The other members of the strike team are now searching the woods that line this side of the valley.”

Hisako nodded and walked through the gate. Richter dismissed his night vision and followed her. The bodies of dozens of goblins lay piled in heaps. Many had arrow holes in their eyes, throats, and chests. Black blood stained the faces of the dead and more than a few had ragged tears in their necks. It was obvious that while some had died without even feeling the arrows that claimed their lives, others had died choking, as their own blood filled their lungs.

The campfires were still burning. Damien explained that to keep the fiction going that the guard post was still manned, they had to keep everything looking as similar as possible. It should keep anyone in the main encampment from getting suspicious. That was why the torches on top of the gate were still lit. It was also why three sprites were now on top of the parapet, pretending to be the recently killed goblin sentries.

Richter walked forward and looked upon the valley with his own eyes. Like Alma had shown him, a large grove of trees grew on this side of the vale. Richter walked through them until he crossed over into grassland that dominated most of the valley. The land dipped down from where he was standing, giving a clear view. Though clouds still floated across the sky, the light from three moons illuminated much of the land.

From his position, he could see the goblin encampment. It had been built on a hill along the northern bank of the river that crossed the valley, flowing east to west. The end of the river entered a cliff face that was a quarter mile south of where he was standing. Other copses of trees dotted the vale, but for the most part, it was open country. The valley floor was comprised of lightly rolling hills. Making it to the goblin’s base would have been a nightmare, even for the strike team, but the walls of the river bank were high. It would be tight, but from what Alma had seen, there was just enough dry land along the river for the team to make it to the hill beneath the camp.

Richter looked back at the copse of trees and then forward at the valley before him. An idea occurred to him. He knew time was of the essence, but this could change everything. The chaos seed activated Stealth and moved forward as quickly as he could. Richter stopped periodically, making a broad arc in front of where his people lay hidden. Fifteen minutes later, he walked back into the trees.

Yoshi had started arraying their forces. The Mist Village guards had been divided into two distinct groups. Melee fighters were in front of each fifty-man block and casters were kept to the middle. Terrod and Caulder were in charge of each group. Both the captain and the sergeant were unhappy with the fact that Richter would be going into the encampment without them. They understood they lacked the stealth capabilities required for this phase of the mission. Richter walked up to Hisako and Yoshi.

“Where have you been?” the adept asked.

Richter took out his map and showed the half-sprite exactly where he had stopped. With a small flexion of will, he made red dots appear on the parchment at all the places he had stopped. They were placed so that a clear path could be wended through them without endangering members of the warband.

“And all of these are traps?” Hisako asked.

“Yup,” Richter said with a little smile.

“What do they do?” Yoshi asked, frowning at the map. “And are you sure you were not spotted?”

Richter shook his head, “I was in Stealth the whole time, and these are all high level web traps created by an assengai queen. Acid, constricting and razor webs will fire out if triggered. I made sure to place them within bow range, but still far enough away that none of our forces will be caught when they go off. If we can draw the goblins to us as we planned, we can start shooting the goblins as they approach. Once they rush forward in a group, they should trigger the traps.”

“They will come for us,” Yoshi said definitively. “All goblins fear our imbued arrows, but also know that their best chance for survival is closing to melee range as quickly as possible.”

“Good,” Richter said. “Now, as Scout, I can make everyone in the war party see enemies that I have spotted. I’m assuming you can do the same with traps?”

A sadistic little smile appeared on Yoshi’s face. He concentrated for a moment, accessing his War Leader interface. Then he turned to Richter and spoke in a stern voice that was somewhat undercut by the residual smile, “It is done. In the future, it would be best if you made us aware of all possible resources prior to the eve of battle.”

Richter didn’t believe the adept’s tough guy act for a second. He shrugged and said, “What can I say? I’m a man of hidden depths.”

“Hmpf,” was Yoshi’s only reply. Hisako smiled at Richter, though and just shook her head. The adept called his second in command over and gave an order that every member of the war party was to be notified that the glowing red dots they could now see were traps to be avoided.

Once the other sprite walked away, Hisako addressed Yoshi and said, “Finish your report.”

“There are no other hostiles in the immediate area,” Yoshi said. “Our forces are well hidden, and each sprite has at least fifty arrows.”

“Well done,” Hisako responded. “I am glad that we are prepared for battle, but we cannot have more than two hours until sunrise. Is your team ready?”

“We are.”

“Do you still think it prudent to add Lord Richter and Sion to your team?”

Yoshi looked appraisingly at the chaos seed, “The lord has accounted himself well thus far . Also, your son has only grown in power since last we saw him. In addition, there are ten meidon sprites who would have undergone Uddo Rengai soon. Now that the guard post has been subdued, I believe they could be an asset for this next phase of the attack.”

“They have sworn their allegiance to Lord Richter, so the decision is his,” Hisako stated

Richter headed off the inevitable question, “Of course.” Hisako nodded and then turned her attention to her sword adept.

“This is an important mission, Adept Yoshi.” Hisako’s voice was firm, and her gaze was steady. “I do not understand why so many different forces are arraying against us at this time. I do not know why goblin and bugbear tribes, tribes that hate each other almost as much as they do us, are suddenly coordinating incursions into the forest. This night we have an opportunity, however. We can crush one of their encampments, seize one of the goblins’ most powerful objects and take whatever else they have come for. This must happen. Do not fail me, Adept Yoshi.”

The half-sprite went down on one knee and bent his head, a knight kneeling before his liege, “Kva ti relada voe.”

“Ti voe reladii,” Hisako responded. She placed her hand on his head, almost in benediction.

Richter hadn’t heard the phrase for a while, but he remembered Sion saying it months ago after he made a grave mistake. His Companion had spoken the sprite words as a solemn vow. Yoshi had just done the same, pledging “My life for my word.” Hisako had accepted his pledge and responded with the ritual response, “Your word for your life.”

The sword adept got back up. He looked at Richter and said, “We need to leave.”

The chaos seed nodded, and said, “I’m ready.”

Richter ordered the snake to stay behind and guard the Hearth Mother. The strike team reformed and they bolstered their numbers with the other ten meidon sprites. Richter took the time to cast Night Vision on himself, Sion and the other members of the strike team that didn’t have enchanted bandanas. With that done, Yoshi took point.

They walked through the copse of trees until it ended, then moved as quickly as possible down the hill to the river. Yoshi had them wait for the clouds to block the moonlight before they crossed out into the open. Once they reached the riverbed, they sped up, moving at a fast but silent jog.

While they traveled the four miles to the goblin encampment, Richter went to each member of the strike team and offered his enchanting skills. They each handed over their climbing claws, and he used low level soul stones to replenish the charges. He also handed out more health, stamina and mana potions. His stocks were running low, and he thanked the gods again for the Dragon’s Cauldron. Alma flew just above his head.

All of their breaths came out in short huffs. The river flowed quietly along beside them. Sprite armor was made for stealth, so no jingling mail or loose metal gave away their position. Even their footfalls were magically quieted by their Reinforced Sprite Boots of Silence. Richter kept his eyes sharp for traps, but all he saw was water and mud.

In no time, they were beneath the goblin encampment. The embankment they stood beside was sixty feet of vertical rock, so they would be hidden from view unless a goblin peered over the edge and looked straight down. Even from their position far beneath the enemy settlement, Richter could smell a foul stink coming from above. It was a mix of rotting bodies, untended latrines, and a horrid funk that Richter had learned to just call “goblin.”

The chaos seed sent Alma high up to do recon and pulled his map out. Most of the strike team faced out to keep watch, but Yoshi leaned over the enchanted parchment. The entire view was in shades of black and green, showing that Alma was seeing with night vision. Soon the red triangle of an enemy appeared, though, then another, then dozens, then hundreds.

Richter’s mouth went slightly dry as he saw exactly what they were arrayed against. He lost count of all of the enemies above him, but it was at least three hundred. What made it worse was that he knew she was only showing the enemies that were outside. There were over two dozen wooden buildings constructed that could conceal two, three or even four times that number of enemies.

He forced his breathing to calm. The most important part of the info Alma was sending wasn’t about the enemies; it was about prisoners. The other reason that Yoshi had decided upon the river approach was that this edge of the camp they were standing beneath was also where the cages for the prisoners were located. Dozens of yellow squares appeared on the map, clustered in three cages. None of the cages were large, and it looked like most of the prisoners were forced to occupy less than three by three feet of space. They were filthy and abused. Many had festering sores on their faces, arms and other exposed skin. Disease was rampant among the prisoners.

There didn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how the captives were imprisoned. Dwarves, elves, humans, sprites and gnomes were shoved into the cages like cattle. Goblin guards walked around the jails, despite the later hour. There were only ten guards, however. Seeing as how the prisoners were weak and sickened, it wasn’t hard to understand why the goblins didn’t consider them a threat. Even those ten should be able to slaughter all the prisoners in short order, especially if only one cage opened at a time. Still, it seemed a bit light on security to Richter.

The walls around the encampment looked much the same as before. It was erected in sections, leaving massive gaps. An inner wall had been erected around some central buildings, and the goblins guarding those two gates were both more alert and better equipped. Also within the inner encampment was the cave that Alma had seen before and the sacrificial area with the blood stone. It still sickened Richter to see the pit of bodies next to the artifact. Some of the details were hidden because they were seen through night vision, but the bodies of dozens of men, women, and children could still be seen.

Alma was finishing her sweep when she heard a scream. Flying over a section of the camp near the cages, what she saw made Richter so angry that he tasted acid in his mouth. About seventy goblins stood over eight wailing prisoners. There were two elf women, three gnomes, two males and a female, a young human woman, and a human boy. Richter’s teeth pulled back in a snarl. They were being raped.

The goblins not actively involved stood around jeering while the prisoners sobbed and begged. A ninth gnome woman lay unconscious on the ground. Her lack of awareness didn’t save her from being abused just as horribly as the others. Two goblin fighters were using her at once.

One group of goblins had decided to make a game of it. A naked and bleeding elf woman stood in a circle of them. One fighter chased her with a smile on his face and a dagger in his hand. She already bled from at least five different places, the worst of which was a ragged cut across her left breast. As she begged, the goblins only hooted louder, aroused by her pain.

The rapes were happening only a couple hundred yards from the prisoners. Now Richter understood why there weren’t more guards around the cages. A row of buildings separated the cages from the clearing that held the goblins and their abused victims. A look of stark fury came over Richter’s face. It was so intense that he started shaking and he didn’t even hear Yoshi the first two times the adept spoke.

“Richter. Lord Richter! Battle Sergeant!” Yoshi hissed.

The chaos seed looked over at the adept, “What?” he snapped quietly.

“I see the same thing that you see,” Yoshi said tapping the map. “It is horrible, but I have seen goblins do far worse. They will do far worse if we do not save the rest of these people. The truth is, what is happening to those nine may be why we are not facing thirty goblins around the cages. Their suffering will help us to save the rest.”

“Would you be so cavalier about the ‘suffering’ of those men and women… and that boy, if they were sprites?” Richter asked bitterly. What he had just seen had ignited a rage inside of him. His face felt hot, and his fingers twitched involuntarily while he imagined them wrapping around a green skinned neck.

Richter may have been hot with anger, but it was nothing compared to the cold hatred that overtook Yoshi’s face, “I have been fighting this war longer than you have been in this world! I have seen goblins skin babies alive and feed them to pigs. I have found the remains of their victims after they are tied over sear ant nests. The goblins like to do that because their captives sometimes break their own backs. The pain from the thousands of bites contracts their muscles that hard. You think I do not care? You are a fool!” Yoshi spat. “Do not speak to me of that boy’s suffering. You sound like a boy yourself! That boy is enduring something horrible, and though he does not know it, he endures it to save the lives of all the other captives. Now will you continue to whine and let those poor souls’ sacrifice be for nothing, or will you stop sniveling and fight?”

Richter and Yoshi glared at each other for several tense seconds. The chaos seed fully considered attacking the adept, so great was his anger, but Yoshi’s words rang true. It was Richter who finally looked away, ashamed. He channeled his anger and quashed his self-indulgent shame. When he had controlled himself enough to speak again, a volcano of anger still burned inside of him waiting to erupt. He promised himself that the goblins would feel the pain of their victims a thousandfold. With his eyes clear and full of hate, he spoke softly, “I apologize, Adept Yoshi. You are right. How do we help these people? How do I kill as many of these motherfuckers as possible?”

Yoshi told him how.





CHAPTER 31 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





There were large gaps in the wall surrounding the goblin encampment. Unsurprising, seeing as how less than half of the outer barbican had been constructed. The spaces were too large for the goblins to monitor every weak spot all the time. To make up for that, they had patrols walking around fairly frequently. If any of those groups spotted the strike team and sounded the alarm, it was game over.

The plan was relatively simple. As they had said before, there were four main objectives. One, find and take whatever had drawn the goblins to the valley, or barring that, destroy it. Two, steal the Bloodstone. Three, destroy the goblin forces. Four, rescue the captives. While the first three had greater military significance, they would all be much easier to achieve if the allied army didn’t have to worry about noncombatants. Because of that, phase one of the incursion was to get the prisoners to safety.

The one piece of good news was that the goblins were lazy. The cages holding the prisoners had been placed in one corner of the encampment. Two walls had been built, hemming the area in, but nothing had been built where the two walls met. That section faced the river. The goblins had let the sixty-foot drop onto the rocks be deterrent enough for any escaped slaves.

In all honesty, they were probably right in most cases. The cliff would most likely be enough to keep the prisoners contained, or at least to ensure the death of anyone that failed to make the climb down. Considering the fact that the cliff was mostly rock and loose scree, and that it went almost straight up, it was highly unlikely that any of the weakened and diseased prisoners could have made the climb. Richter had no idea how Liddle had done it, considering the state the hill sprite had been in when they had found him.

While the cliff might be enough to keep the prisoners in, it might as well be an “Enter Here” sign for the strike team. They all prepared to climb. The original strike team would go first, making hand- and foot-holds with their climbing claws. Richter, Sion and the other meidon sprites would follow. Yoshi took point.

The sword adept moved faster than should have been possible going straight up. The other sprites went up as well with their climbing claws out, creating holes as they went. Each time Yoshi reached up, he activated his claws and turned his hand in a clockwise motion, while moving it in a slight circle. It created small holes in the rock. It wasn’t much, but with Richter’s high Strength and the climbing boost from his gauntlets, it was no problem to follow. The meidon sprites had even less of an issue. In a few short minutes, the entire team was at the top of the cliff. Then it was time to kill.

Yoshi had already given kill orders to the sprites before they began the climb. The twenty sprites split into four different groups, each with five archers. Richter had handed out a few vials of poison to the meidon sprites prior to the climb, and each sprite had three or four arrows with the leech poison smeared on. Alma continued to fly above them all, her dark body unseen, and gave real time updates as to the positions of the goblin guards.

Seeing her visual feed, Richter felt like he was looking at one of the old games he used to play. Specifically, it looked like Battlefield 9: Water Wars. He shook his head to clear it of idle thoughts and focused on what he was seeing. Enemy combatants walked around lazily chatting to one another and ridiculing the prisoners. Two were fully drunk, judging by the bottles they held and their lopsided gait. The sprites moved forward, trusting in the darkness and their Cloaks of Concealment to keep them hidden. They all looked at the goblins they would attack soon and waited for the signal.

When Yoshi had told him what would trigger the attack, Richter looked at him in shock and disgust. His anger had started surging again, and the adept was the closest available outlet for it. The half-sprite had said nothing in defense. He had just returned Richter’s gaze and let the chaos seed remember his previous words. Ultimately, the chaos seed had nodded in acquiescence.

So the sprites waited in the dark, watching their hated enemies. Each of them nurtured murder in their hearts, wanting nothing more than to set their dark impulses free. The wind blew lightly, bringing another putrid gust of the camp’s stink to their noses. No one moved. Then, another high-pitched scream rent the air from the poor souls being violated just north of the cages. The goblin guards all stopped and turned towards the sound, leering in gross joy at the pain being caused.

The sprites unleashed death.

Twenty bowstrings snapped as one; the sound finished before the woman’s begging scream even ended. Arrows sprouted as if by magic from eyes, mouths, throats, hearts and heads. The goblins collapsed to the ground. Watching them fall, all Richter felt was a rough and bitter satisfaction as he thought, I hope you enjoyed that scream, you filthy fucking animals. He moved into action.

Half of the sprites rushed forward to search the bodies of the goblins for keys to the cages. Getting closer, the smell of unwashed bodies and bodily waste was nauseating, but Richter fought down the impulse to vomit and accomplished his task. He and Sion secured several ropes from his bag to the bars of the cages. The other ends were thrown over the cliff. Then the prisoners started to arrive.

Several of the children cried out in fear when their cage doors were opened, but the others quickly quieted them once they realized they were looking at sprite faces. All members of the strike team scanned the surroundings, but no goblins came looking. Richter guessed that cries of pain and fear were most likely commonplace, so even if they had been heard, they were probably also quickly ignored.

One by one, the prisoners left the cages and walked to the cliff’s edge. There was a tense moment when one of the larger human captives shoved a woman out of the way in his haste to leave the cage. It was not the time to address it, however, so Richter just used Analyze and made a note of the man’s name, Edgin.

The prisoners who were strong enough to climb down the ropes immediately went over the side. They were instructed to start walking west and were assured that the strike team would catch up soon. After suffering at the hands of the goblins, they needed no further urging. Small children were tied to adults with lengths of rope and taken over the edge as well. Richter was confused that there were no elderly prisoners, but then he looked back at the emptying cages. In each were the decaying bodies of prisoners that had already succumbed to disease and harsh conditions. His heart almost broke when he saw the small form of a baby that had been left behind in the churned mud of the jail cell. After seeing the haunted look in the eyes of the prisoners, the chaos seed couldn’t find it within himself to cast judgement. Instead, he turned his eyes towards the north. He could still hear occasional screams and hooting goblin laughter. Phase two, he promised himself bitterly. Phase two.

Not all of the prisoners were strong enough to make the climb. Some were so weakened by disease that their health was in the low double digits. These, he knew, had to be strengthened. Richter waved one of the sprites over.

“Drape your cloak over my hands,” he ordered. Then he began to cast. Golden light surrounded his hands again and again as he cast Weak Slow Heal. The more powerful minor version of the spell would have had a greater effect, but he had a finite amount of time and an even smaller mana pool. Each time he cast the spell, he watched some of the color return to the abused captives’ faces and was gratified when a few were strong enough to attempt the climb.

Two of the other members of the strike team saw what he was doing and placed their hands under the cloak as well. Golden light surrounded the other sprites’ hands, and Richter breathed a sigh of relief. Some of the sprites were Life magi. His own mana had been close to being depleted. One looked at him and raised his other hand, moving it in hand speak.

^We handle this. Recover.^

Richter sat back and drank a mana potion. He would have liked to have had Alma’s help him with the healing, but she was too important in her role as overwatch. Only minutes had passed since they had killed the goblins guarding the prisoners, and Yoshi was determined to hold this position to give the prisoners as much time as possible to reach safety. If any goblins found the empty cages, the game would be up. So the strike team remained to kill any goblins that might approach. Richter’s gaze turned north, unable to forget that all the while, innocent men, women, and children continued to be violated only several hundred yards away.

The chaos seed understood the reasoning, but couldn’t help feeling sick about not helping the people the goblins were abusing. He also could not shake the fear that at any minute the strike team would be discovered and hundreds of goblins would bury them in hatred and steel. Almost as if his thoughts had summoned calamity, he heard a harsh whisper.

“I cannot leave. They have my wife and son!”

Richter looked to his left. On the other side of the cage, he saw a human man talking to Yoshi. The man had indeed whispered, but with the harsh inflections he was using, it sounded as loud as a tea kettle whistling to the chaos seed.

Yoshi leaned close and tried murmuring quietly to the man, but the human just shook his head vehemently, and said, even louder this time, “They are my family!”

Richter rushed around the cage and grabbed the man by the arm. The pressure he applied must have been more than he intended because the man sank down on one knee and had to bite his lip to stop from crying out. The chaos seed immediately let go and used Analyze.

Sinking to one knee as well, Richter leaned in and put his face right in front of the man’s. “Oreet. Your name is Oreet, right?” After the man nodded, he said, “Well, Oreet. I know that you are concerned about your family, but you have to trust me. We are here to save all of you. As soon as you and the other prisoners are over the cliff, and moving towards safety, we are going to get the others.”

Oreet looked at him, and tears streaked down his face. He pleaded with Richter, “But they are hurting them. Can you not hear it?” As if to mock his pain, a low moan of anguish came from the north, followed by the inevitable hoots of goblin delight.

“I hear them. I hear them,” Richter said, his own heart sickened by what was happening. “I promise, we will make them pay.”

“Will you save them?” Oreet asked. He sounded like a man falling to his death asking god for a parachute. They both knew that his family was never coming back, but he couldn’t face the truth.

Richter’s face froze for a moment, but then he said, “Of course. I’m here to save you all.” He had never actually hated himself before that moment.

Oreet looked at him with an inscrutable gaze, before nodding and saying, “Thank you.”

Richter gave him a nod and stood helping the man to his feet. He motioned Oreet towards the cliff face. Some of the sprites were tying those too weak to climb to the ropes and then lowering them over the side. He turned back to ask Oreet to help and saw that the human was gone. Whipping his head back and forth, he couldn’t see him. Richter checked his map, and cursed silently when he saw a yellow square moving north at a run. The square was moving directly towards the goblins that were raping his wife and son.

The chaos seed made a split-second decision. He might be able to reach Oreet before the goblins noticed him, but he’d have to kill the man to stop him quietly. Whatever stains his soul would have by the end of the night, that wasn’t something he was prepared to do. Instead, Richter ran to Yoshi.

The sprite was conversing in hand speak with Damien. Richter took out his Traveler’s Map and pointed. Yoshi took in the situation in a glance. The adept could guess who was running towards the goblins and why. His eyes hardened, and he looked back up. He spoke aloud, knowing there were only seconds left.

“We need more time to get the captives free. Someone will need to draw them away from the river bed.”

“I’ll do it,” Richter said immediately.

“You won’t do it alone,” Yoshi responded. He called out to Damien and five other members of the strike them. Their orders were simple: delay the goblins that were just north of them and then lead the entire enemy army through the valley. “You must keep their attention away from the riverbed,” the adept repeated to Richter.

“I’ll do it,” the chaos seed repeated grimly. He started casting buffs as quickly as he could. Weak Haste, Weak Barkskin and Weak Life Armor. It wasn’t much. His armor only increased by +3 and his speed by 10%, but he would take it.

“Yes, we will,” Sion said, loosening his bow.

The screams north of them grew louder and over fifty goblins’ voices rose in anger. A single human voice yelled back.

Richter looked at his friend with steel in his gaze, “Ready to kill some more bad guys?”

Sion looked back wild-eyed, with a savage grin on his face, “Oh yes, brother! That’s what we do!”





CHAPTER 32 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG




The yelling crescendoed. All of the women began to scream as well, and Richter thought he even heard a child’s voice join in. The screams cut off abruptly, one after another. It was quiet for a moment, then the sound of fell horns filled the air. The squealing calls rang out from the goblins just north of the cages. Soon there were answering calls from all across the goblin encampment. Through Alma’s eyes, Richter could see the camp roil like a kicked anthill and Richter’s stomach dropped as the number of red triangles exploded on his map. More enemies were coming out from cover. A lot more.

The chaos seed pushed his fear aside. There was a more immediate concern. The goblins had finished slaughtering Oreet and their rape victims. Now they were coming fast towards Richter and the other sprites. They left bodies of their victims behind and flowed between the buildings to reach the cage area.

Richter quickly reached into his bag and pulled out something he had been hoping to save until later in the battle. He handed them out to each of the sprites. Sion asked, “What is it?”

“It goes boom! Throw it at the goblins when you see them and don’t look directly at it when it happens! Fuck! There they are! Throw it! Throw it now!”

Richter and the six sprites each threw the Crystallized Red Foxfire as the first of the goblins boiled out of the gaps between the buildings. The goblins were approaching in three distinct lines, funneled by the wooden buildings. Two crystals flew to each gap, and Richter arched his throw a bit higher to fall farther back in the middle line. The red gems flew forward and cracked on impact. The unstable alchemy released, and the goblins burned. They BURNED.

When the first crystalline red sphere shattered, it released an explosive field of pure force. The skin on the closest goblin’s face rippled as if pushed back by a strong wind. A split second later, the fire came. It was the birth of a tiny sun, and flame washed out in all directions. As the explosion expanded outward, the blaze flowed like water. Throats were seared as the goblins’ yells turned to screams. Those closest to the explosion just saw a bright flash. Then the fluid in their eyes superheated, causing the soft globes to burst. White, ocular fluid started to flow down their face, but the heat continued to cook the liquefied remains and charred it on their cheeks.

Then the second sphere shattered, and it all started again. The buildings burned, but they also funneled some of the flames. Even past the ten foot AoE of the foxfire, some of the flames still reached further back into a column of goblins. Those who did not die outright from the release of the alchemy caught fire. Their bodies went up like living torches and their screeches added to the chaos and confusion. What had been a force of nearly seventy bloodthirsty goblins, turned into barely over fifty green skinned cowards in mere moments. Almost all of the survivors were partially blinded by the explosion of light and red fire.

The living goblins either screamed if they were on fire or roared in pain if they were blinded. The entire enemy advance ground to a halt for a few seconds. That wasn’t time that Richter and his allies were going to waste.

As soon as the initial explosions finished, Richter started running, and the sprites began imbuing arrows. The chaos seed ran to the middle of the building right in front of him. He didn’t slow when he got close but instead jumped towards the wall. One foot planted on the wooden planks, and he used it to gain extra altitude. His hands reached up and grabbed the roof, pulling himself up, and he kept running. He barely missed a beat.

Richter ran forward on top of the building while fire ate at the walls on either side. He kept one mental eye on the video feed Alma supplied while he ran. It was going to provide an absolutely spectacular view of the deaths he was about to cause.

The goblins recovered from their partial blindness and blinked, wondering why there were still six points of light that were brighter than the other afterimages in their vision. One or two of the smarter goblins even wondered why the light was blue rather than the red of the fire they had just survived. The shrewdest one had time to think “Oh shit” just before the sprites released their imbued arrows. Richter wondered if the goblins that were still burning were actually thankful when death claimed them.

Two imbued arrows shot down each of the three corridors between the buildings. Not too much charge had been built in the shots over the past five seconds, but it was enough to cause a large boom. Each arrow struck a different goblin. The sprites had chosen targets that were already wounded, and the exploding arrows caved in chests and sheared away the goblins’ faces. Six more goblins died without even coming close to their killers.

It wasn’t only the initial targets that suffered. Four of the sprites were meidons. Dark and Air magic augmented their imbued arrows, causing secondary damage to any enemies nearby. The concussive force released also damaged the surrounding goblins. It was not sufficient to kill the rest, or even maim them, but it was enough to send the goblins reeling again. That was all that Richter needed.

The blasts from the arrows had worsened the structural integrity of the buildings even further, and the roof Richter was running on began to buckle. It didn’t matter, though. He had reached the end of the building. The goblins that hadn’t entered the corridors between the buildings were clustered, fear and uncertainty on their faces. The chaos seed could see fear on their fire-illuminated faces. They were close to breaking, and some were even turning to run away.

Oh no, Richter thought. The time for that has passed. Some of the goblins looked up as he leaped from the roof. Though they did not know it, they were witnessing the unleashed wrath of a chaos seed, for the first and last time.

Richter extended his hand and released the dual casted spell he had stored in his Ring of Spell Storage. It had almost completely depleted his mana pool, but it was worth it. A green disc appeared in the air and a level twenty-two chokespore arachnid jumped through, right into the center of a group of goblins. Three went down under its weight while the others raised weapons to attack, but the spider immediately used its special attack! A cloud of spores appeared in the air, and nine more goblins fell to the ground, struggling to breathe.

The chaos seed had scanned the crowd before he jumped, and his eyes fixed on a particularly large goblin in the back. It wasn’t the goblin’s size that had caught his gaze or the fact that he was one of the grinder station. It was the fact that the green skinned fucker was holding onto the naked body of the dead boy. The child’s jaw hung loose because one cheek had been ripped away. The grinder was holding the boy’s remains the same way a child might hold the leg of a teddy bear as he dragged it through the house. Seeing such a callous disregard for the remains of the murdered boy made the edges of Richter’s vision turn red.

The goblin was too far away to kill immediately, but Richter promised himself that he would find a special end for that particular black-hearted bastard. At the moment, though, there were others within his reach. Sighting on a goblin that stood just in front of where he would land, he screamed bloody murder. Both of his hands were clenched around the hilt of his elementum short sword. The look of horror on the goblin’s face brought a wild joy to Richter’s heart. It felt even better when he swung his green blade down, and the scout was literally split in two. Black blood drenched Richter from his hair to his knees. Only the white of his eyes shone in the firelight while he chose his next victim.

Bare seconds had passed since he had launched off the roof, but it had felt like time stretched as he fell, keeping him in those moments for a frozen eternity. All that had mattered was his will and those who would die because of it. When he landed, though, everything sped back up. For those moments that he fell, even sound seemed to have faded away, but he clearly heard the squealing roars of the goblins around him as he landed. The two halves of his first victim fell to either side and the battle continued!

A fighter to his left rushed forward screaming and swung a mace. If the blow had landed, it would have brained him, but the goblin overreached. Belying the fact that he was a full two feet taller, Richter still ducked under the swing and brought his short sword to bear against his attacker’s leg. The clear green blade swept through the goblin’s knee, freeing limb from body.

The goblin screamed again, this time in disbelief and agony. It dropped to the ground grabbing its own severed limb like a mother would hold her child, but Richter was already moving past. He spun to the left, staying low, and reached out one hand. As his fingers, contorted in a spell form, a green glow appeared. Richter spoke a word of Power.

A dark circle appeared under the feet of a group of goblins running toward him. A moment later, they all collapsed. They each cursed and yelled at one another, blaming their fellows for the fall. One screamed, however, due to his comrade’s sword having cut him by accident.

Richter raised his sword arm and deflected a spear strike. Standing quickly, he deflected the goblin’s next attack, while curses continued to emanate from the ground behind him. Before the scout could attack a third time, a gold light appeared behind him followed immediately by a bolt of lightning. Richter grinned at his familiar as she swooped past.

She unleashed her Psi Blast against a knot of enemies, who all fell to the ground twitching. Richter walked towards the scout that Alma had downed. The goblin’s limbs twitched in a seizure. While he moved, his free hand developed a red glow, and he spoke another word of Power. Without looking back, he pointed that hand at the dark circle that had tripped the cursing goblins. Fire shot forth igniting the grease, and the goblins started screeching.

Richter smiled even bigger. He heard one burning fighter call for his mother in goblin-speak. The chaos seed took a sick pleasure in it. It was always satisfying to burn enemies caught in his Grease spell. He had started to think of it as his signature move, and lighting them up while not even looking… well, that was just all types of cool! A small piece of himself cried out that he shouldn’t revel in the death and agony of others. A larger piece of him didn’t even bother replying. It just asked for more blood. Richter was happy to oblige.

His sword fell once and then again on the downed scout. The damage from his blade was magnified by the critical strikes to the goblin’s face, not that there was even a face left when he was done. Turning quickly, Richter blocked a mace strike with his short sword, the elementum blade scoring deeply against the iron cudgel. The Disarm enchantment on the blade triggered, and the mace flew out of the fighter’s grasp.

Richter threw a gauntleted punch into the goblin’s face and found that he enjoyed the sensation. There was a slight “give” that was unique to teeth being forced down an opponent’s throat. The goblin took two steps back, moaning through its ruin of a mouth, and the chaos seed followed. Putting all of his strength into his swing, the elementum blade entered the goblin’s neck, kept traveling and exited the other side. A black fount of blood shot up from the severed neck and the fighter’s head raced his body to reach the ground first.

The Mist Village lord turned around, seeking another enemy and promptly took two arrows to the chest. His armor stopped the worst of the damage, but he was still flung backwards. He fell onto his back with a crash and a soft wumpf escaped his lungs. Instinctually, Richter rolled to the side. Right after, another arrow struck the ground only inches from his body. Goblins rushed at him, shouting.

Richter rolled twice more until he spun fast enough to use the momentum to get to his feet. As he stood, he saw three goblin archers taking aim on him again. That was right before arrows illuminated with blue magic struck all three. His boys had gotten back in the fight!

One goblin took an arrow to the face, and the explosion savaged his features. The goblin screamed, clutching at his face. The other three arrows struck the goblins in the chest and extremities. They weren’t dead, but they would be down for at least a few seconds.

Richter assessed the situation. Only thirty or so goblins were still on their feet. More were alive, but they were either screaming in pain, disabled, or both. Five of the sprites were engaging a group of goblins in hand to hand combat while Sion shot arrows as quickly as he could. The goblins were too close to the other sprites to use imbued shots, but they should still be able to win the day. That just left the nine goblins running towards him, screaming for his blood.

Richter used Analyze on all of them in quick succession. As always, he didn’t even need to read the information that was now available to him, he just knew. Because of that, he understood that he was facing three scouts, four fighters, and two grinders. More than that, he recognized one of the grinders as the one that was holding the body of the boy. The chaos seed’s lips pulled back in a snarl, and he readied his attack.

With a flick of his wrist, his elementum short sword left his hand and entered the earth, hilt sticking up. Richter downed a blue mana potion and started a dual cast. Green light surrounded his hands once again. Words of Power fell from his lips as the goblins got closer and closer. It was clear to all of them that he was casting a spell. The goblins all shared the same thought. The one thought melee fighters always had when facing a mage. They needed to kill him before he finished.

They were too slow.

The three second cast time elapsed and Richter’s mouth opened wide of its own volition. Invisible rings of sonic force shot from his mouth and quickly expanded. They flowed over the fighter that had only been eight feet away from him, and the goblin dropped as if he had been shot in the head. He fell to his knees holding his ears, mouth open in a scream that was silent compared to the mind-numbing screech of Richter’s sonic attack.

The chaos seed’s mana pool dropped by one hundred and three points. Every goblin within twenty feet and inside of a thirty-degree arc of his voice suffered from the attack, and many were deafened. Not all fell to their knees like the first fighter, but it still stalled their attack, as they blinked in pain. That was all Richter needed.

He closed his mouth and was about to start forward when a heavy dagger flew towards him and struck him in the shoulder. Richter knew which goblin had thrown it, but it didn’t matter because he blamed them all. The blade penetrated part of the way through his armor and stuck out of the meat of his deltoid, but he didn’t go down. Instead, making eye contact with the nine goblins before him, and with only feet of space between them, he pulled the dagger from his shoulder and cast it dismissively to the ground.

Blood continued to pour from the wound, decreasing his health by two points per second, but he barely noticed. Alma flew up to hover behind him, a golden glow suffusing her body. As Richter withdrew his elementum short sword from the ground and drew its moonstone mate from the sheath on his back, a golden disc appeared in the air, and a glowing fox jumped through. The chaos seed smiled at the now uncertain goblins with a wild gleam in his eyes. He pointed his elementum blade at the dagger thrower, and in clear goblin speak he said, “You’ll pay for that, my son!”

“Who in the hells are you?” one of the grinders shouted in guttural tones.

Richter just cocked his head crazily and said, “You can call me daddy.”

The goblins roared in anger and surged forward. The chaos seed ran forward as well, and hell came with him.





CHAPTER 33 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG




The summoned fox fired a beam of pure golden light at Richter, and his wounds began to close. Seeing their quarry healing, the goblins squealed in anger. Three goblins led the pack, and the others followed right behind. With a mighty yell, Richter swung his elementum sword. A scout raised it rusted iron sword to block. There was a loud ping as the chaos seed’s superior weapon cleaved through the goblin’s blade and bit deep into the scout’s chest. With his other hand, Richter raised his Dense Moonstone Short Sword of Goblin Slaying. The heavy weapon was as good as a shield, sweeping aside the spear thrusts of the other two goblins.

Richter’s first victim fell, already dead from a cleaved heart. He swung his elementum blade down on the next goblin. It was deeply satisfying seeing the green metal bite deeply into the scout’s face. He was about to attack the third when a mace swing caught him in the chest.

Richter is struck by Goblin Fighter for 13 points of Blunt Damage.

The chaos seed’s swing was interrupted, but his armor kept the blow from causing too much damage. Instead, he let the force of the blow push him back, extending the distance he moved with a small hop. The goblin band surged forward, and the mace-wielding fighter pressed his attack.

Even through the pain, Richter smiled slightly to himself. They just didn’t understand. He wasn’t the same person he’d been when he arrived in The Land six months ago armed with only a crappy knife and a shittier bow. He was a fighter. He was a caster. He was a killer.

If that wasn’t enough, his Enhanced Sprite Armor made him a tank when matched against their low-quality weapons, and his elementum and moonstone blades made him a butcher, just waiting to carve. His magic made him even more deadly. It was his pitiless will which truly sealed their fates. Richter smiled because the goblins were missing the most salient truth of their soon to be ended lives. He was judgement.

The mace wielder that had struck him pressed the attack, hoping to keep him off balance. The goblin quickly swung again, but Richter was faster still. He set his feet and defended himself using the sword form, Cliffs of Dun. His clear green blade met the steelhead of the fighter’s mace, stopping the swing cold. Before either combatant could react, the Disarm enchantment in blade triggered again. The over-eager goblin could not hold onto his weapon, and it flew free from his hand. Richter’s smile deepened as he brought his other blade up and attacked using the first sword form he had ever learned, The Forest Wind.

His white blade crossed from left to right at shoulder height, and for the first time, Richter saw the true power of a Slaying enchantment. The fighter was wearing chainmail, but he might as well have been naked. The moonstone blade ripped through the rusted links, sending them scattering in all directions. It was the flesh that truly suffered, though. The goblin’s skin and muscle split open almost as if they were fleeing his blade. Hot, black blood sprayed everywhere, coating Richter’s face and landing in his snarling mouth. The devastation he caused to the goblin’s body might have been nauseating if the chaos seed didn’t find it so thrilling.

The fighter fell with a cry and Richter left him screaming on the ground. His body wove into the form, Willow in the Storm. For the next few seconds, his body moved and contorted into positions that would have made a yoga master proud. The number of goblins was too much for Richter to defend against all at once, and he began to take damage. A knife stabbed into his leg. A sword skittered off of his bracer. A spear jabbed into his belly but thankfully was repelled by his breastplate. Still, he kept his head and kept retreating backwards, never letting himself be surrounded.

Over the next two minutes, Richter took over a hundred points in damage while not being able to counterattack once. The summoned fox stayed well back from the fighting and shot him with two more healing beams, restoring his health as quickly as he lost it. One goblin stopped attacking the chaos seed and tried to kill the Life creature, but the agile fox simply danced away and continued to support its master.

At some point, Richter started laughing. Hearing his mocking peals drove the goblins to an even greater fury. Each of them hungered for his death. In their minds, if they killed him quickly enough, they could help their comrades fighting against the sprites and still win the day. It was their very anger that made Richter laugh. He knew that they had forgotten about something.

They had forgotten Alma.

When he had started this final exchange with the goblins, he had given her a command. She hadn’t liked it, but she obeyed. For the past minute or so, she had flown high above and reconned the rest of the goblin forces. The last thing Richter needed was to finish this fight and find himself surrounded by hundreds of enemies. Thankfully, no other goblins were rushing towards them. Instead, they were forming in orderly ranks outside of the inner wall. Richter knew this didn’t bode well for the rest of the battle. It meant there were capable enemy commanders who wouldn’t let their forces rush against an unknown threat. At the moment, though, he gave less than zero fucks. It meant he would live for at least a few more minutes. Once he saw there were no reinforcements coming, he ordered her back. That was when the laughing began. He only had to wait.

Richter weathered the goblins’ attacks for a few more seconds before he heard a voice in his mind, *Now, master!*

Richter executed the form, Setting Sun. Both blades swept down and out, pushing away the weapons of the goblins closest to him. It gave him half a second of respite. With a wink, the chaos seed let his body collapse into a backward roll. There was now nothing keeping Alma from unleashing her primary attack. The time Richter had spent enduring their attacks had been for more than just making sure that more goblins weren’t coming. It was also so that his little lady could recharge!

Alma flew in from straight behind Richter, her small body passing right over him. She bared her teeth and screamed in rage at the goblins that had dared to harm her master. In its tightest and most powerful beam, she unleashed Psi Blast.

The goblins had no defense.

All seven of Richter’s remaining enemies collapsed to the ground. Their arms and legs jerked as every neuron in their brains fired at once. As they convulsed, blood began to pour from their eyes, ears, noses and mouths, evidence of the health damage Alma’s Psi Blast had gained at level two. Because her primary attack had advanced to level three, even when the stun effect wore off, there was a good chance her victims would suffer from Disorient. Of course, it was a moot point. Richter wasn’t going to let them recover.

*Good job, little mama,* he thought with bloodthirsty satisfaction. *Go help the others, but hurry back. You’ve got some people to eat.*

Alma screamed in triumph and flew towards the goblins still fighting Richter’s sprite allies. Four of the goblins were down, but so were two of the sprites. It left Sion and two others to face twelve goblins, five of them fighters. The battle might have gone either way if, once again, Alma hadn’t delivered death from above. While she flew, she also sent the healing fox to support the sprites. Richter drew his bow from his Bag of Holding and nocked an arrow. The chaos seed immediately began imbuing it with mana.

Sion saw Alma flying towards them, and behind her, he saw his best friend imbuing an arrow. The fucker was pointing right at him! The aura even had those weird blue-white lightning bolts Richter had gained since learning Enhanced Imbue Arrow. He could just hear how the conversation would go. “What are you doing, Richter?” “It’s all part of the plan, Sion.” “Plan? What plan?” he would ask. Then the chaos seed would give that smug, fucking smile and say, “Don’t worry. Depending on your perspective, this is the easy part!”

The meidon sprite played that entire conversation through his head in a moment. He considered wasting time being pissed, but instead, he dropped his weapons and pulled on the armor of the two sprites fighting with him, “Move!”

All three sprites fell back, and the glow around Alma faded. A circle of sparkling golden dust appeared with the goblins in the center. They took no real damage, but they still started screaming and hacking in pain as the glitterdust entered their eyes, ears, and mouths. The goblins swung blindly. Richter waited another second so that he could be sure he had invested the hundred and seventy-five mana needed to trigger psi crystallization, then he released.

The arrow sped across the short space and impacted against the chest of one of the goblins. The wash of magic spread out several feet, knocking them all to the ground. Mind Fog, Stun and Psi Crystallization afflicted some of the goblins. They cried out at the injustice of it all, and their sprite enemies walked forward grimly, weapons raised. The ensuing slaughter was halted at Richter’s call.

“No! Don’t kill them. Sion, help Alma. You know what to do.” The chaos seed gave his friend a wild smile and then started walking among the goblins that were still stunned by Alma’s Psi Blast. As he moved, he stabbed each in both legs, ensuring they would stay down even if the psychic attack wore off.

Sion watched him do this until he reached the largest goblin. Unless the sprite was wrong, the goblin was a grinder. His friend didn’t hurt this one. Richter just thrust his sword into the ground and started talking to the seizing goblin. The sprites looked at him, wondering if the lord had gone insane.

One of the other sprite’s spoke up, “What is he doing?”

The other asked, “What did he mean, ‘you know what to do’?”

Alma had already latched onto the head of one of the goblins. Her victim fell silent, overcome by the dragonling’s Brain Drain. The fighter had a blue-white crystal floating near his head. Sion quickly checked and saw that two of the other goblins did as well. While the other goblins continued to cry out, blinded and panicked, the sprite stepped towards the one Alma had chosen. Almost speaking to himself, he answered the second sprite, “This is what he meant.” Sion’s green blade pierced the fighter’s heart, and Alma gorged.





CHAPTER 34 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG




While Sion executed the goblins, Alma fed on their psyches, and the other sprites saw to their fallen comrades, Richter finished the conversation he had started with the senseless grinder, “… and so that’s why it’s important to me that you know that this is personal. After what you did to that boy, and the way you disrespected his body afterward… What were you even planning to do with the body?” Richter looked down at the seizing goblin and shook his head, “No. You know what? Don’t tell me. Just know that I wish I could give you a worse death than this. I pray that your soul burns for eternity.”

His conversation done, Richter stood up again. Part of him wondered if something in him had snapped at seeing the casual torture and rape of the poor people he had failed to save. Another, larger part of him said it didn’t matter. There were more goblins to kill. The chaos seed extended both arms and his fingers contorted while he spoke a word of Power. Golden light surrounded his hands for a moment; then he turned away.

Alma and Sion had finished killing the goblins they were facing. They were now moving on to the goblins felled by the dragonling’s Psi Blast. His summoned spider had been hacked to pieces long ago, so Richter summoned a saproling for protection. The two sprites were helping one of their comrades back to his feet. Another was already up and leaning on Damien, but the last had a jagged gash across his throat. His eyes stared up sightlessly. The summoned fox had expended the rest of its healing magic healing the two fallen sprites and had already faded away.

Richter walked over to the sprite Damien was helping to stand. He was seriously favoring one leg.

“I believe it’s broken, Lord Richter,” Damien said. “He took a hard blow to the leg.”

“Leave me,” the sprite said. There was a small quaver in his voice, but his face was firm. “I will kill many of the puke skins before I fall.” Richter used Analyze and found out his name was Nusin.

“Why don’t we try something else, Nusin,” Richter said. He bent to examine the sprite’s leg.

“We do not have time, Lord Richter,” the sprite protested. “They will be on us in seconds!”

“Quiet,” the chaos seed sharply. “Right now, the goblins are marshalling their forces. We will probably need to move in the next five minutes before they start sending out strike teams, but we have the time to save your life.” He had the sprite lay down, and his fingers probed the area of the break. From what Richter could tell, the fracture was contained, and no shards broke the skin. Placing one hand on top of the Nusin’s thigh, and the other behind the sprite’s knee, Richter pulled in one controlled, strong tug. The two ends of the injured man’s femur ground together as they aligned. Nusin screamed but thankfully remained conscious. Richter then quickly cast one of his new spells, Weak Mend Bone.

Gold light extended from his hand into the sprite’s leg. Nusin’s scream stopped with a gasp that turned into a sigh of relief. Richter cast Minor Slow Heal for good measure, and then pulled the sprite to his feet. Testing it gingerly, the sprite found he was able to put weight on it, but he wouldn’t be running.

The chaos seed looked behind him, scanning for enemies. Nusin hadn’t been wrong. It had been at least ten minutes since the horns had blown. It was only because of the cautiousness of the enemy commander that they hadn’t been overrun already. All Richter could think was that precedence was being given to whatever it was the goblins were protecting. The images Alma had shown him had clearly shown the goblins taking up a defensive position around the inner barbican. Still, it wouldn’t be more than a few minutes before the enemy commander sent out a strike team to investigate. When the goblins discovered that there were only a few enemies and not a bloodthirsty horde at their gates, Richter and the sprites would be crushed. They probably wouldn’t be too happy that all of their prisoners were gone. Shit was about to go down. It was time to make some decisions.

“Damien, take Nusin over the cliff and down to the river bed. The two of you should be able to move back towards the valley entrance. The rest of the plan stays the same. Me, Sion and the other sprites will lead the goblins through the valley to the ambush site.”

“Absolutely not,” Damien said firmly. “The Battle Leader gave me express instructions to keep you alive, Lord Richter.”

“He can’t go alone,” Richter retorted.

“I will be fine,” Nusin interjected. Both Richter and Damien ignored him.

“I agree with your plan, Lord Richter. You have just allocated the wrong people. There is another member of our team that has been wounded as well. You, Sion and I will lead the goblins, while the other four go along the riverbed. If you think I will agree to anything else, I promise you that I will be damned to the Hell of Bloody Goblin Shit first!”

Richter just looked at him for a moment, and then nodded. Still, he had to ask, “Hell of Bloody Goblin Shit? You made that up, right?”

Damien returned his gaze with a stony face but then ruined it with a wink. “We should move out in sixty seconds. We still need to make them chase us, though.”

“Oh don’t worry,” Richter said with a glint in his eye. “I’ve got that covered.”

“I am going to guess that you do not feel like sharing your plan?” Damien asked.

Richter’s smiled.

“Yoshi was right,” Damien said, shaking his head. “You are a major pain in the scrot.” Richter’s face froze for a moment. Not because he was offended, but because what the sprite had just said was such an obvious improvement over pain in the ass. Damien kept talking, “It looks like Sion is almost done dealing with that trash. Whatever your grand plan is, you might want to implement it.”

The chaos seed looked over and saw that, indeed, only the two grinders were left alive. The rest had been given the coup de grace. Despite what Sion had said about disliking murder, he seemed to have no problem ending the goblins’ lives. His Companion was actually raising his blade over the one Richter had spoken to while Alma was latched onto the goblin’s head. The chaos seed’s heart started hammering wildly, and he shouted, “Wait!”

Richter ran over to his confused friend. Focusing on Alma, he sent a thought, *Can you neutralize the effects of your Psi Blast?*

*Why?* Alma asked, her voice languid with pleasure. After consuming the psyches of so many sentient creatures, she was feeling no pain.

The chaos seed explained his plan aloud so that Sion could hear as well. Alma sent an evil little chuckle through their psychic connection, and the sprite just laughed. She readily agreed. Soon the goblin was blinking his eyes in confusion, but no longer seizing. The dragonling detached from the grinder’s head. She and Sion moved over to their last victim and Richter leaned over and used Analyze.

Name: Pild-nacRace: Goblin Station: GrinderDisposition: Charmed (Hatred)

Goblins can have subclasses that determine their specific powers. Most are a common variant however that are broken into different stations reflective of their physical and magical characteristics. Prolific breeders and woefully aggressive, goblins are a plague on other races. The goblin Grinder receives better training than many other stations, and unlike most goblins, has an innate intelligence equal to most humans. No less aggressive, these foes are not to be taken lightly. If they advance far enough, Grinders can obtain Professions. Grinders receive four points to distribute per level, and each level gives +1 to Constitution.

Level: 17

Strength: 28

Agility: 21

Dexterity: 25

Luck: 15





He breathed a slight sigh of relief when he saw that his Charm spell was still in effect. The spell had an hour duration, but as with all things in The Land, nothing was set in stone. The hour was only a maximum boundary. This was especially true for a spell like Charm. It could convince an enemy to fight for him, but it couldn’t make the creature completely go against its own nature or best interests. Richter couldn’t make the grinder cut his own throat, for instance. Trying to would break the enchantment. Hell, his spell was so low level that even asking Pild-nac to hold hands with Sion might break the enchantment, seeing as how the racial hatred between goblins and sprites ran so deep.

Richter hadn’t been sure if his spell would hold once the goblin regained consciousness, but he was delighted to see that it had. Pild-nac’s low Wisdom meant he had a low magical defense, especially compared to the 50% boost in power Richter’s Life spells received, and the chaos seed had made sure to dual cast the spell to give it a little extra umpf. On the other hand, goblin grinders were smarter than their counterparts in weaker stations, like fighters or scouts. It had been entirely possible that Pild-nac could have broken the enchantment upon waking, but the “Charmed (Hatred)” disposition put Richter’s mind at ease. The first word proved that the enchantment was in place, while the second showed the goblin’s true feelings were attempting to reassert control.

“Do you know me?” the chaos seed asked in goblin-speak.

The green skinned fighter blinked a few more time, but then replied in goblin-speak as well, “Of course I do, my friend. I cannot remember your name, though.”

Richter put a friendly smile on his face that did not match the evil in his eyes. He helped the goblin to his feet, and said, “My name is McClane. I’m so happy that you’re feeling better, my friend. You saved us from the sprites! Now, I need you to answer a quick question for me, and then I need just a very small favor.”





CHAPTER 35 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Pild-nac ran through the goblin encampment screaming at the top of his lungs, “The commander. I must speak with the commander!”

He ran past a small goblin contingent of thirty grinders and fighters that had been sent to investigate the attack near the slave pens. The leader considered stopping him, but Pild-nac ran by too quickly shouting, “We have to protect the item! Run! The sprites are coming this way!

The contingent leader eyes widened. He knew that a goblin force twice the size of his had been near the prisoners for the nightly recreation. He also knew Pild-nac. The grinder was a liar, an asshole, and a thief, but he wasn’t a coward. Also, Pild-nac was basically drenched in black goblin blood, a detail that was due to Richter gutting a dead goblin and shaking the corpse over the charmed grinder like a salt shaker over fries. When the goblin leader factored in that all the goblins in the encampment had heard the distinctive boom of sprite imbued arrows, he ordered a retreat. Soon, the entire scout force was running behind Pild-nac. Each of the goblins shouted “Attack! Sprites! Attack!” at the top of their lungs, wonderfully adding to the pandemonium.

A few minutes later, Pild-nac was admitted through the inner barbican. This was achieved much more easily than it otherwise would have thanks to the contingent leader swearing that a horde of bloodthirsty sprites was directly on their heels. It didn’t matter that he hadn’t seen anything personally. He was not going to let an asshole like Pild-nac outshine him.

Soon enough, the charmed goblin was approaching the encampment commander himself, the massive Heqht-jo. The grinder tried to continue forward, but the commander’s personal guard were much more diligent about protecting their leader than the gate guards had been about letting him into the inner barbican. Pild-nac was stopped more than a dozen yards from the commander, who looked at him in anger and suspicion. The commander stood next to the Bloodstone, and beside him was hit pet caster, Radg-or. The rikker station goblin stood with his hand on the red jewel, and his eyes glowed scarlet from accessing the power within.

“What happened?” Heqht-jo bellowed. “Speak, fool! How are you the only one alive and why are you smeared with the blood of goblins?”

Pild-nac mumbled a response.

“Louder! I swear that I will skin you alive if you do not tell me what I want to know!”

Pild-nac started stammering. He spoke quickly, but it was absolute nonsense, interjecting the words “sprite” and “prisoners escaped” periodically, exactly as Richter had bid him to do.

The commander lost his temper and stomped closer to the grinder, intent on throttling the information from the blood-drenched coward. The mage behind him cast a spell, though. His eyes widened, and he hissed, “He is enchanted. Go no closer!”

Heqht-jo’s head whipped back to look at the mage, before looking at Pild-nac again, an even hotter fury burning in his chest. The commander felt himself slipping into a rage.

The grinder smiled, relieved that the farce was done. He knew that McClane was his very best friend in the world, as unlikely as that seemed, but it had made him uncomfortable lying to his fellow goblins. A small voice inside of him had also been screaming something about how Richter was a hated enemy. That had made no sense to Pild-nac though, so he had just ignored the voice. As time had passed, the irritating voice had been getting harder to ignore. That was why the grinder was pleased that he could carry out McClane’s final request.

Pild-nac smiled at the commander and shouted the expression his human friend had taught him. The goblin didn’t understand any of the words, but McClane had promised that the phrase was an expression of friendship. The grinder shouted, “Yippe ki yay, motherfucker!” at the top of his lungs; then he slammed the four “peace” crystals together. McClane had also promised that when the red granulated spheres were smashed, Pild-nac would get a wonderful “reward.”

Radg-or had started casting right after warning Heqht-jo. It still bothered him somewhat that the Bloodstone could speak into his mind, but this time, the powerful item had saved him. Not wasting any time, the caster had finished his incantation, the red light in his eyes glowing brighter as he drew on the power of the Bloodstone. He was not a moment too soon. The grinder’s body exploded with fire that quickly washed outward. Even twenty yards away, the caster felt the heat. Radg-or finished the spell Krin-lac’s Circle of Containment and drew heavily upon the powers of the Bloodstone.

A magical sphere appeared around Pild-nac and the five goblins closest to him. A small of amount of fire had already escaped beyond the AoE of Radg-or’s spell, but it quickly died out, barely singeing any of the goblins. Inside the sphere, however, was an inferno. Through the green energy field of the caster’s spell, every goblin present could see a spinning maelstrom of flame. It pushed against the boundaries of the Earth magic spell, and Radg-or bared his teeth in strain. The Bloodstone user kept one hand on the object of Power and extended his other hand towards the sphere.

The spell was active, allowing him to continually feed energy into it. For a moment, the walls of magic rippled and vibrated as the simultaneous release of four Red Foxfire crystals threatened to overwhelm it. The alchemy could not overcome the power of the Bloodstone, however, despite that fact that the wielder was not a Blood mage. Goblin fists could be seen beating against the inside of the containment sphere. This only lasted for a few moments, however, then all that could be seen was fire. The conflagration continued to rage.

The fires finally died, and only churning black smoke remained. The caster kept the sphere in place for another full minute, just to be safe. It was silent as the grave as all of the goblins looked at the contained explosion and realized many of them had narrowly missed death. When the spell was finally dropped, the smoke diffused out into the air quickly. A choking stink of charred corpses and cooked flesh spread to every goblin inside the barbican. Even the goblins were slightly sickened.

All that was left of Pild-nac and the five other goblins that had been trapped within the sphere were blackened bodies. All of them were stuck in a rictus of death and pain. Even their gear had been destroyed, reduced to a durability of zero. Precious few of the goblins lamented the deaths of their fellows, but many were disappointed that the time-honored tradition of stealing from the dead could not be observed.

Alma saw all of this from high above. The sky was beginning to lighten as dawn approached. Her small black body was still unseen against the barely brightened sky, though. Richter gritted his teeth as he watched through her eyes. The chaos seed had truly been hoping to cut the head off the snake by killing the enemy commander. The goblin mage’s quick thinking had ruined that. The wounded sprites were already in the riverbed. The chaos seed, Sion, and Damien were on a rise just outside of the goblin encampment, awaiting the pursuit Richter had promised. A pursuit that now might never come. To make everything worse, there were far more goblins in the camp than they had thought.

Sion saw the distress on his face, “What is it? Didn’t it work?”

Richter waved a hand quickly back and forth, silently telling his friend to be quiet. Sion fumed slightly, but silently. The chaos seed continued watching through the eyes of his familiar.

The goblin caster slumped, the red glow in his eyes finally subsiding. The rikker pulled his hand free of the Bloodstone. He couldn’t seem to let go at first, but he was eventually able to release it. A bloody, black handprint was left behind on the red jewel. It was quickly consumed, leaving the surface unblemished.

Heqht-jo did not thank the caster that had saved his life. That was the purpose of his lessers, after all, to serve and protect him. Instead, he walked forward. The powerful goblin pushed his guards roughly to the side and continued until he stood over the blackened remains of Pild-nac. The commander didn’t spare a glance for the other dead goblins. Their usefulness had come to an end.

The large goblin looked down at the traitor’s remains, and his breathing started speeding up. Each exhale came out louder and more forcefully as fury filled his black heart. They tried to kill me, he thought. They tried to kill ME! The accursed forest rats would pay for this! He would drink the blood of their children and cut the manhood from each male and the tits from each female! They would pay!

“Kill them,” Heqht-jo shouted at the top of this lungs. “Kill them all! Send for the others!”

Heqht-jo formed a war party under him, including the nine hundred goblins present as well as their mercenary allies. The commander couldn’t wait the hours it would take for reinforcements to come. Rage had taken hold of him. The commander decided to crush whoever had dared to attack him! His mouth already watered as he thought about tasting the bloody flesh of his enemies. He repeated his order, screaming his rage.

The horns of the goblin warband echoed out and the encampment boiled with activity. The commander ordered his forces to start moving west, the only way attackers could have entered the valley. The goblins started screaming with battle lust.

Richter looked at Sion and Damien with a sick grin on his face. It wasn’t precisely the carnage-filled result that he had wanted, but his gambit had still gotten the job done. “I have good news and bad news. I’ll tell you both, but we need to start running. Now!”

The sprites had heard the horns just as the chaos seed had, and they offered no argument. Sion cast Weak Haste on himself, and Richter cast the same spell on Damien. They all started sprinting, praying to make it back to the safety of their people. Alma caught up soon and cast Weak Haste on her master, increasing his movement and attack speed by 10%.

“What is the bad news?” Sion yelled as he ran.

“What is the good news?” Damien shouted at the same time.

Richter kept facing forward as he ran, but shouted his answer back, deciding to answer Damien first, “The good news,” he shouted back, “is that my plan succeeded, and they’re coming this way.”

“And the bad news?” Sion repeated.

“The bad news is that no matter what the fuck your perspective is, that was the easy part!”

The three kept running, pursued by the goblins’ horns, a bloodthirsty horde, and a commander howling for their blood.





CHAPTER 36 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The three of them ran until they crested a hill a half-mile from the encampment. At that point, they turned and armed their bows. They couldn’t risk the goblins paying too close attention to the river bed. All three of them started to imbue their arrows, slowing the flow of mana as much as possible. The goal was not to kill so much as gain attention. Richter was pretty sure this would piss the goblin horde off and keep them from thinking. He was right.

The goblins at the front of the enemy warband squealed when they saw the trio of lights. Renewed horn blasts echoed through the valley. The three of them released, striking different targets. It seemed like all of them shared the same sense of humor because each arrow exploded against a horn blower. None of the goblins died, but it was still amusing hearing the horn calls cut off abruptly. Richter and the sprites shouldered their bows and started running again.

The chaos seed checked his map as he ran. Alma flew high enough to provide a clear view of the valley. Dawn had broken, putting the sun at their backs. It meant the sprites would be fighting with the light in their eyes, but it also meant that the western edge of the valley would remain in shadow. With any luck, the goblins would not detect the sprites hidden in the trees until the ambush was sprung. Richter dismissed Night Vision on all of them, and they kept running.

Alma was also able to see the escaped prisoners. They were strung in a line between the riverbed and the shelter of the trees. The most hale were close to reaching the relative safety of the trees. The sicker and weaker prisoners were moving much slower, though. Richter didn’t know if they would all make it before the battle started, but he couldn’t worry about it at the moment. Honestly, most of this attention was on what was going on behind him.

Richter was not a coward. Since coming to The Land he had fought demons, undead, a dark aberration and a twenty-foot tall rock monster with a serious grudge. He had felt fear but had still always done what was needed. What he saw through Alma’s eyes, though, made his blood run cold. A literal wave of enemies flowed across the ground behind him. For the first time, he knew, not suspected but knew, that he was facing something that he absolutely couldn’t resist by himself.

Close to a thousand bloodthirsty goblins were howling for his blood. Richter found untapped reservoirs of speed. He had never been so thankful for the conditioning he had received over the past months. His stamina bar had a max of three hundred and fifty points, and it was steadily falling as he ran. If he wasn’t already used to moving over uneven terrain for days at a time, though, it would probably have already bottomed out. Another horn blast echoed from behind. The three comrades kept running.

“They seem pretty mad,” Sion panted.

“It is almost as if… they objected… to us burning their house down,” Damien agreed with a grin.

“You guys… are so… insensitive,” Richter gasped. He had a serious stitch in his side. “Now pay attention… and make sure… you don’t set off… the boobytraps.”

“Boobytraps?” Sion asked in a strained voice. “What… fucking boobytraps?”

“The ones… I put… in the valley,” Richter said. “Didn’t… Yoshi tell you?”

“I have… been with you! Why didn’t… you tell me?” Sion gasped in recrimination.

“I knew,” Damien chimed in, smiling past the pain in his legs.

“Shut up!” the meidon sprite snapped in irritation.

Another horn sounded. The three of them pushed even harder.

While Richter ran, he kept his mind off of the certain death that was right behind him by dealing with his prompts. The latest notifications dealt with the experience he had gained from Alma’s psychic feast.

You have been awarded 1,432 experience (base 32,741 x 0.07 x 1.25 x 0.5) from Brain Drain against Level 8 the Goblin Scout.

The prompts continued to cascade. The first goblin scout Alma had drained was the least experienced of her prey. Each gave Richter several thousand experience points even with the 50% penalty. He read through them until the last prompt brought a wonderful surprise with it.

He was out of the fucking hole. It almost balanced out the fact that his veins were currently filled with nothing but gasoline. In fact, it did! Richter started grinning so broadly that when Sion saw his friend enjoying himself while they ran for their lives, the sprite muttered “asshole” under his breath. Richter didn’t hear him, but it wouldn’t have ruined his excitement if he had. The fact that it had taken the lives of over twenty sentient creatures to get him the final bit of needed experience didn’t faze him at all. There was no reason that all that XP should have gone to waste after all.

It was also awesome that he had found a new quest chain! And he had already completed the first two links! Cha-ching! When he had gained both his Profession and his Specialty he had been told to “honor” them if he was to progress. Richter had thought it was just hyperbole. These new secret quests proved him wrong. He realized that he really shouldn’t be surprised. Again and again, he was shown that words were not just idle wind in The Land. They had power. He resolved to pay closer attention to such things in the future.

Then he turned his attention to the items he had collected before running like a bat out of hell.

You have found: Psi Crystal. Durability: 10/10. Item Class: Scarce. Level: 10. Weight: 0.9 kg. …

You have found: Psi Crystal. Durability: 10/10. Item Class: Scarce. Level: 15. Weight: 0.9 kg. …

You have found: Psi Crystal. Durability: 10/10. Item Class: Scarce. Level: 12. Weight: 0.9 kg. …

Richter called Alma down to him and touched her with all three crystals. The blue-white light within the jewels flowed into his familiar, and she launched herself back into the air with a cry.

Know This! Pure psychic energy can enhance the characteristics of your Psi Dragonling. Each level of your Psi Crystal equates to 1 Psi Point. Current Psi Points available: 41.

Weak Psi Poison

Your dragonling’s teeth and claw will now exude a psi poison. This does minimal damage but makes concentrating more difficult. While the poison is active, the target is also more susceptible to psychic attacks.

10





Richter was tempted to purchase Natural Armor II, but Alma needed more offensive capabilities. If she had them, maybe he wouldn’t have had to take a three-minute beating during the last fight as a distraction. It was time for his girl to get an upgrade. He bought Weak Psi Poison, and the description in the prompt changed.

Minor Psi Poison

Your dragonling’s teeth and claw will now exude a stronger psi poison. It still causes minimal damage, but the penalty to concentration is markedly increased. The target may suffer from profound paranoia. While the poison is active, the target is also more susceptible to psychic attacks.

20





The chaos seed read the new prompt. The minor version of the poison apparently made it hard to concentrate and caused paranoia… Richter was surprised it didn’t cause the munchies too. Still, the fact that it could increase the chance of mages to miscast made it worthwhile. He purchased the next rank, and the table changed again.

Psi Poison

Your dragonling’s teeth and claws will now exude a stronger psi poison. The poison now causes a slight amount of health, mana and stamina damage. Chance of spell misfire increased and now there is a slight chance for spell backfire.

40





Total Psi Points Remaining: 11

Richter dismissed the prompts and focused on the run. He felt a profound sense of relief when the three of them finally crested the last hill, and they saw the trees. They were barely a mile from the entrance to the valley! A check of Alma’s feed showed the leading edge of the goblin army was only two hundred yards back. Richter had been worried that their pursuers might slow when they got closer to the trees, but as he continued to scan the scene through the dragonling’s eyes, he realized with a sinking feeling that wouldn’t be a problem.

Just as he had feared, the slowest of the released prisoners hadn’t yet made it to the safety of the trees yet. They were spread out over a quarter mile, from the riverbed to the mouth of the valley. If the sun hadn’t risen, the goblins might have missed the former captives. With the sky lightening, however, if the prisoners weren’t seen immediately they would be seen soon.

“Sion!” he called out, worry in his voice. The pain of having sprinted three miles was horrid, and his stamina bar was getting close to bottoming out.

“I see them. Keep… running,” the meidon sprite responded.

“They’ll be killed!”

“Keep running!” Sion shouted. “Trust the… Hearth Mother.”

Richter kept his gaze on the prisoners for another few moments. If they didn’t make the tree line, they would be dead as soon as the goblins caught up with them. His jaw firmed, though. Sion was right. He couldn’t keep making the same mistake of trying to do everything himself. He had to trust his allies. His arrogance that he knew better than anyone else had caused deaths in the past. The chaos seed wouldn’t make that mistake again.

They kept running.

The ground lit up with the red glows of his traps, easily seen by the entire war party thanks to Richter’s position as Scout. Damien and Sion ran well clear of the hidden snares and made it to the tree line. About twenty sprites were outside of the trees hurrying the prisoners along. Richter ran into the trees, following the icon that showed Hisako’s position. Yoshi was with her.

“We have to help these people,” Richter gasped as he stopped running. “The goblins will be here in minutes!”

“Peace,” Hisako said soothingly. “Peace and calm. They are already safe. We did not sit idly by while you were in harm’s way.”

She quickly filled him in. After the strike team had left, she had sent sprites to observe the encampment from afar. One of those sharp-eyed sentries had seen the prisoners making their way along the riverbed. Once they were spotted, a group of fifty sprites had run forward out of hiding to help the captives. It was a risk, but a calculated one. If the captives were effectively hidden by the river bank, then the sprites should be as well. All of the captives had been brought safely back to the woods. Hisako had already cast mass healing and cure disease spells. Apparently, some of the captives had even asked for weapons so that they could join the fight.

“Then why did I see-” Richter began, but then it clicked. It was a trick. Hisako had figured out the same thing that he had. There needed to be an enticement for the goblins to rush towards the tree line. She had given it to them. The chaos seed had no doubt that the “stragglers” outside of the trees were prisoners that had volunteered to fight. They were risking their lives to draw the goblins into a trap. After seeing the conditions the captives had been kept in, it was not difficult to imagine the anger they must feel. Some of them were most likely scarred for life, but others would probably sacrifice anything to spill the black blood of their former captors. Richter also had a feeling that the weapons and armor of the slain goblins would be put to good use soon.

Hisako smiled faintly at seeing the light of realization in his eyes. Her joy was short-lived. The peal of a goblin’s horn stopped any further conversation. It was so loud that without looking Richter knew that the goblins had crested the final hill. The sounds of dozens then hundreds of screaming goblin voices rose into the air. Hisako looked at Richter and said, “It is time.”





CHAPTER 37 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The “stragglers,” who had been moving with exaggerated slowness, picked up speed as they made their way back into the trees. They still played into the image of wounded captives, though, limping and struggling. It was like blood in the water. The goblins howled and rushed forward, eager for slaughter. The sprites outside of the trees also played into the deception. They shouted in alarm and started firing imbued shots into the goblin horde while they backed up. Seeing as how there were only a dozen sprites visible, though, their attack looked like they were throwing pebbles at a green avalanche. Though a few goblins fell, the overall effect was minimal. The only deaths were actually caused by the fallen being trampled by their comrades who surged over them as they thirsted for blood.

A specific sequence blasted out from a goblin horn. The goblins advanced. The group was entirely comprised of scouts and fighters. The sprites hidden in the trees readied their shots. Hisako had already noted ranging landmarks, and every sprite awaited her order, just inside the tree line. If the goblins had stopped for even a moment, they might have spotted their hated enemies, but they were blinded by bloodlust.

The lead edges of the enemy advance crossed a large rock that was two hundred and fifty yards away. Richter knew that the sprites could fire accurately at that range, but still, the Hearth Mother waited. Hisako watched as the goblins passed the two hundred yard mark, but still she held. Another two seconds passed, then, with a face that could have been cast from steel, she completed a quick casting. A high-pitched whistle shot through the air, and over three hundred bow strings launched as one.

The first volley was not imbued, and neither was the second or the third. The arrows were nearly invisible in the early dawn light. In the space of seconds, almost a thousand arrows sailed through the air. The goblins at the front of the pack had time for a moment of terrified realization before arrows plunged into their chests, limbs, necks and faces.

The opening salvo of the battle claimed the lives of almost one hundred enemy soldiers and injured almost twice that number. Hisako nodded to Yoshi, who raised a sprite horn to his lips. In contrast to the squealing clamor of the goblin horns, this instrument let loose a pealing note that sounded like the lilting call of a bird. Ta-Rii, Ta-Rii.

All of the anger, hatred, and bloodlust the goblins had been feeling was replaced by fear as they saw the distinctive blue glow. From birth, the green-skinned soldiers were told stories of the evil forest rats and their horrible magic arrows. Seeing hundreds of imbuements at once was like seeing their worst nightmare made real.

The goblin commander ordered shield units prepared with a curse. Centuries of battling the sprites had proven what tactics worked against the sprites and which didn’t. Time and again, goblins had been able to win battles if they could close the distance to melee range and overwhelm the sprites with superior numbers. Heqht-jo also knew that as destructive as the imbued arrows could be, each sprite had a limited mana pool. If he could get them to waste most of their magic against the shields of his forces, then he could crush them. Some goblins would most definitely die while that was happening, but that was what battle fodder was for.

The shield units rushed to array themselves in front of the goblin army. If they had advanced further forward, the shield bearers might have saved those at the edge of the sprites’ attack range, but the fate of those closer to the tree line was sealed. This was why Hisako had waited to give the order to strike. She had needed the goblins well within her people’s attack range. Heqht-jo knew that as well. He left the advance team to live or die based on their own strength rather than waste more valuable units.

The sprites powered their shots for five seconds, the standard attack time indicated by Yoshi’s horn blast. Years went into training sprite archers. Those countless hours paid off as they released as one. The shots flew forward, and the cumulative detonations echoed through the valley with a massive BOOM! Goblin scouts and fighters from the first attack wave screamed in terror as death fell from above. Dirt, bodies, and waves of magical force flew this way and that. A cheer was taken up by the combined forces of the Mist Village and Hearth Tree. The battle ground to an early halt as the forces on both sides glared at one another over a field of bodies.

Heqht-jo gritted his teeth. The other truths that all goblin commanders learned were that one, you did not attack sprites entrenched in trees, where their cursed Woodcraft ability tilted the odds in their favor, and two, you must never let them ambush you. He had failed to keep both of those things from happening. It occurred to him that retreat might have been the most prudent course of action at that point. True, the prisoners would be lost, but they were simply a means to an end. More could be captured, and it was unlikely the sprites could defeat his forces once they were fortified. Most importantly, the artifact would be protected.

The thought did not last more than a moment in the goblin’s mind. He would not be defeated. He would not bear the insult of losing his prisoners. He would not allow himself to be defeated in battle, at the hands of sprite no less. It would lower his rank in goblin society. He would kill them all! It didn’t matter if it cost him the life of every soldier under his command. That had always been the racial strength of goblins. More could always be bred. No, he would attack and sacrifice every prisoner. Besides, he thought with a smile, he had the Bloodstone.

Heqht-jo looked to the Druid at his side, “Protect them.”

The Professed Druid, Radg-or, adopted a cruel smile and began chanting. Green light surrounded his left hand, and his right rested upon the Bloodstone. A red glow ignited behind his eyes, making him look like a demonic creature. The goblin shield units arrayed themselves at the front of the warband and awaited the order to strike.

Radg-or drew heavily on the mana pool of the Bloodstone and not for the first time he wished he could command its full powers. Without Blood magic, however, he was severely limited in his manipulation of the sanguine item. The Druid definitely had offensive spells, but the Bloodstone didn’t extend the range of his spells. Still, the thousands of points of mana it contained would be put to good use, immediately. He cast Soldiers of Stone.

Liquid stone welled at the feet of every green-skinned soldier. It quickly flowed up and over their bodies. One or two began to panic, but many had fought with the Druid before and knew what to expect. The fluid grey rock flowed over the bodies, clothes, armor and weapons of every goblin in the AoE, covering them from head to toe. The rock disappeared a second later, however, sinking into the goblins’ skins and armor. The skins of the goblins adopted a grey tinge and the hide, leather and metal armor grew gritty in appearance. This was just a side effect of the spell. The exact effect was that each goblin’s natural and worn armor had an increased by +10. For the next twenty minutes, the goblins truly had become tanks.

“What spell was that?” Richter asked.

“Soldiers of Stone,” Hisako replied grimly.

Radg-or slumped slightly at having channeled such a large amount of mana into the spell, but he nodded at his commander.

“Forward!” Heqht-jo bellowed.

Two hundred and fifty goblins marched towards the tree line in formation. They moved slowly at first but soon began to pick up speed. Yoshi blew into his horn a second time, Ta-Rii, Ta-Rii. Three hundred lights appeared again, and the goblins broke into an orderly run. Five seconds later, the sprites released another volley.

The goblins stopped abruptly and raised their shields. Those in front held them vertically. It did not have the fluid perfection of a roman legion, but their round shields still stopped a large number of the arrows. Some of the arrows struck home, and others caused the goblins to buckle under the assault, but the injuries were minimal. The entire contingent started moving again.

The sprites fired a second imbued volley with similar results. Yoshi gave an order, as did Terrod and Caulder. Both men moved their melee fighters forward. All of the Mist villagers stared at the goblins coming towards them with a mix of dread, anger, and urgency.

“Trust in your comrades!” Terrod called out.

“For Lord Richter and the Mist Village!” Caulder shouted right afterward. All of the soldiers responded, “Raaa!”

Seeing an enemy they could attack, and one that was half their number no less, the goblins gave an excited scream and rushed forward. They kept moving forward in their controlled run for the remaining one hundred and fifty yards. They stayed wary of another sprite volley, but holes still appeared in their formation. The goblins couldn’t be held back when there was the chance to spill red blood. Each goblin felt an almost sexual pleasure at the deaths they were about to cause. Then they triggered Richter’s traps.

The chaos seed had spread the web traps of the assengai spider queen in a line at about a hundred yards from the tree line. The biggest problem would have been if the goblin commander had only sent a few goblins forward at a time. It would have been a complete waste if only a few goblins were caught. That didn’t happen here. The war cries of the second wave became pleading cries of pain.

Each trap had created its own type of hell. The Tranquilizing Web Trap shot sticky strands in every direction. Richter had hidden two of them, and they were both triggered at almost the same time. The webbing was as bad as glue, trapping every goblin within fifteen feet of the traps. To make matters worse for the entombed goblins, the webs were full of a sedative. Within seconds, the cries of the goblins faded away as the scouts and fighters all lost consciousness. They were the lucky ones.

The goblin that activated the Razor Web Trap disappeared into a bloody, black mist. Soldiers of Stone had greatly increased the natural armor of the goblins, but it still wasn’t enough to protect against a rapidly expanding mass of impossibly sharp, metallic strands that would put Hellraiser to shame. It shied away from the reinforced mail of the goblins and failed to penetrate shields, but there were hundreds of thin wires shooting forward at the speed of an arrow. Dozens of goblins had their bodies pierced, leaving chains of impaled enemy soldiers. Any movement caused the razor webbing to rip larger holes into the goblins. Even those that avoided initial injury found it impossible to escape the AoE of the trap without slicing their bodies open.

Richter had also placed two Constricting Web Traps. Though not the most destructive, they may have been the most horrifying. The range of these traps was also much larger than the others. Both traps shot strands out for twenty yards in all directions. At first, it just looked like an explosion of webs, and over a hundred goblins were trapped in both. Then, the white strands started moving.

They stretched and searched, wrapping themselves tighter around anyone unlucky enough to be caught inside of them. The chaos seed saw one goblin on the periphery trying to escape. Only his leg had been stuck with the white strands, but the webs pulled him back in towards the center of the trap. The last sight Richter caught of him was his face being completely wrapped in white like a mummy. An indentation where the goblin’s mouth would be yawned open, the fighter trying to scream even as he asphyxiated. Then he was drawn further back into the gooey mass of threads, buried alive.

The final trap was the most devastating. Richter remembered that he had found it closest to the assengai queen when penetrating her lair. The strands of the Acidic Web Trap were brown and each dripped thick fluid that sizzled when it touched the group. The radius was only ten feet, but the strands started dissolving what they touched immediately. The goblins caught in the trap started screaming as the acid ate through their armor, skin, and muscles. One fighter was struck by a vertical thread on his head. The strand ate through his body until he fell in two halves, each with its own arm and leg.

The goblins’ attack was destroyed. Those not caught in the traps were just looking around in confusion and panic. Not only did the ensnarement and death of more than two hundred of the advancing goblins halt the advance, the traps made sections of the field impassable. Anyone, goblin, sprite, or human that entered one of the AoE’s of the traps would find a quick death. Once more, the pealing calls of the sword adept’s horn rung out, and three hundred blue lights appeared. This time, when the shots fell on the goblins, no shield wall was erected. The shots also were much more concentrated as the sprites only had to aim at the spaces between the traps. The magically enhanced bodies of the goblins succumbed to the rain of imbued arrows, some even bursting from the intense forces being directed at them.

Heqht-jo screamed in rage. The first two salvos of the battle were over, and the goblins had been beaten soundly. The commander had allowed his forces to be ambushed not once, but twice. His vision began to tint with red and his Profession asserted itself. The Rage of a Professed Barbarian took over. He would not be embarrassed by forest rats! With a guttural cry, the Barbarian ordered an all-out assault. The mercenaries were finally called up from his reserve. Despite the losses his army had suffered, he still had a superior force, and the sprites had to be nearly out of mana. He would see the ground drenched in their blood!

The Druid, Radg-or, tried to counsel the war leader, but Heqht-jo drew his massive war axe and started running forward. Goblin horns pealed shrilly, and the horde surged forward. The final assault of the Battle of Henakot’s Valley had finally begun.





CHAPTER 38 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter looked at the sea of enemies coming towards them in the dawn light. The enemy commander had apparently gotten tired of strategy. He just planned to overwhelm them. Though perhaps that was a strategy in and of itself. He didn’t have any tricks up his sleeve, and the sprites’ mana was mostly depleted. Hundreds of the enemy had been killed, but the goblins still outnumbered them. From what Richter could see, it was mostly scouts and a smattering of fighters that had been slain, the weakest of the goblins’ forces. Fear began to flutter in his heart.

The chaos seed was not concerned for himself, but for his people. Even if they won the day, many would die. Hisako’s magical roots couldn’t save all of them, even if she was willing to expend the precious herbs. Caulder and Terrod ordered his melee fighters to move forward, with the idea of meeting the goblins while they exited the one clear space between the spider traps, no more than fifty yards across. Bottlenecking the enemy should improve their chances. Still, Richter couldn’t help but think of the names he would have to carve into the village memorial by the end of the day, and his heart beat wildly in his chest. Then he felt a soft touch.

Hisako walked in front of him, putting her body between him and the looming battle. The Hearth Mother had a sympathetic look on her face. “I know what troubles you. Believe in your people, and the choices they can make. We are only lost when we believe the evil of this world is beyond our ability to defeat it. Will you stand with me, Lord Richter, to preserve all that is good?”

Richter saw no bloodlust in her face, only love and resolve. Beyond her, he saw the face of his best friend looking at him with a slight smile and a promise in his eyes, that Richter would never be alone again. Then the chaos seed looked at his people, bravely standing against the goblins. He drew his elementum short sword, and said, “You never need ask.” Richter ran to fight alongside his people.

The sprites began firing again. Yoshi blew his horn, not twice this time, but three times and the sprites poured all of their remaining mana into their shots. For ten seconds, they imbued their arrows while the goblins surged ever closer, then they released. The extra damage from investing their mana caused devastation in the goblin ranks. Dozens of lives were claimed, and an earth-shaking BOOM shook the ground not fifty yards from the front lines of the coalition. The goblins did not even pause. A few seconds later, the battle was joined.

Nothing Richter had ever seen or heard before prepared him for the CRUNCH of hundreds of men and women slamming together like a hammer against an anvil. Neither the goblins nor the collected races of Richter’s forces were made of metal, however; they were only clothed in it. Blood, both black and red, flew into the air and screams rose on both sides. His forces held, though. They held!

Richter’s biomancers began casting healing spells immediately, while those in front kept fighting. Maces, axes, swords and spears plunged forward and rent goblin flesh. The superior weaponry and rudimentary tactics of the Mist village forces began to tell. His people fell here and there, but many that were wounded were simply pulled back and healed. Seconds later, they were back in the fight, madder than ever.

The next few minutes were a mess of blood and metal. Richter’s forces suffered losses, but the power of the Mist Village could not be denied. Between the enchanted arms and armor from the Forge of Heavens and the potions from the Dragon’s Cauldron, the forces of the village were wearing and burning through hundreds, if not thousands, of gold coins. Their superior gear immediately proved its worth, though, and the bodies of goblins began to pile up in a line in front of the allied forces.

Richter didn’t regret investing in his forces for a moment. While there might be some truth to his… “thriftiness” in general, the chaos seed had never lost sight of the fact that wealth was only a tool. His only regret was that he had not had more to give his people before the battle. Still, they were kicking ass with what they had!

Here and there, bolts of lightning shot forth from his forces, stunning the goblins so that they could be slaughtered by the village melee fighters. Beyan made himself known by firing his Wand of Dark Bolts and casting his laughing skull spell as quickly as he could. The sprites continued to fire arrows. The missiles may have lacked magic, but they were still deadly. Richter and Sion stood on the frontline, hewing goblins like so much wood. A green blade fell, and a goblin died. Another elementum weapon cleaved the rusted chain mail of a goblin fighter, and he fell screaming to the ground. Battle lust began to take over, and some of the soldiers within the Mist Village ranks began to laugh as they slaughtered their enemies.

They should not have done that. The behemoths had arrived.

Radg-or had begun casting as soon as Heqht-jo had ordered the full assault. The target of his spell was his pet jaguar, Scor. Buff after buff were placed on the black cat, fueled and augmented by the Bloodstone. At the end, its natural armor had increased by +30, its attack speed had increased by 50%, and its damage was boosted by +22. It gained a slow health regeneration, and those were only the highlights. The Druid cast a final spell that tripled its size and greatly increased its Strength stat. With a grisly smile, the caster sent his pet forward with a simple command, “Feast upon them!”

The other monstrosity came from the goblins’ mercenary allies. They finally entered the battle, slamming their weapons on their shields in a horrible din. Yoshi’s eyes narrowed as he saw the one hundred soldiers enter the field. The adept said a single word, the syllable thick with distaste, “Trolls.”

A century of well-armed and armored soldiers crested the hill behind the goblin’s position. The wore matching mail armor that was steel-green in color. The mercenaries were a mix of swordsmen, axe men, and bowmen, though their forces were heavily weighted towards melee fighters. Each was at least six and a half feet tall. What occupied the eyes of everyone on the battlefield weren’t the one hundred deadly troll soldiers. What captured the attention of the entire allied command was the bellowing twelve-foot tall creature that walked in front of them.

The monster leading the troll contingent had green-gray skin. It had well-muscled arms that hung almost to its feet. Its hands were both as large as barrel lids, and each of its eight fingers were tipped with thick black talons. The monster’s mouth hung open, and rows of large yellowed teeth lined the top and bottom of its jaws. It started in hatred at everything and everyone, including the armored troll mercenaries. As it screamed again, Richter had a sinking feeling that he knew what the monster was.

“Is that what I think it is?” Richter shouted even as he parried the mace blow of a goblin grinder.

“Fuck!” Sion answered. He stabbed his elementum blade into a fighter’s face, dropping it cold. “They have a mountain troll!”

Both enchanted jaguar and monstrous troll ran forward to bring devastation to the Companions and their people.





CHAPTER 39 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter watched the two giant creatures sprint down the two hundred yards separating the goblin reserve from his position. The rest of the enemy army was right behind, including the goblin commander and the troll mercenaries. He realized that this would have been a great time for Hisako to summon an angel or some other high leveled creature, but the Hearth Mother had been clear. She would not use her magic until it was needed to counteract the power of the Bloodstone. Richter hadn’t argued, but there were two Devastators barreling down on his forces and someone needed to be a Defensor. With a sinking feeling, he realized “someone” was him.

The chaos seed reached into his Bag of Holding and withdrew a Potion of Gaseous Form. He held one out to Sion, “Bottoms up brosef!”

Sion slashed at another goblin, “What?”

Fucking idioms! “Drink the fucking potion! We’ve got a troll to fight!”

Richter also pulled out two more potions he had been saving for this very moment. Ever since he and Sion had come across a troll in the forest months ago, he had been haunted by the idea of fighting a beast with such horrifyingly fast regenerative capabilities. He had pestered Sion until the sprite had made him a poison. His friend complained about Richter being annoying at the time, but the chaos seed was pretty sure his Companion wouldn’t be bitching now.

You have received: Poison of Stagnant Health. Durability: 8/8. Potion Level: Solution. Strength: Fortified. Weight: 0.02 kg. Traits: Will create wounds resistant to healing for 56 minutes.

Richter liberally poured two doses over each of his swords and handed the last one to Sion who had stepped back from the front lines. The sprite poisoned his blade.

“So we go after the troll? What about the big cat?” Sion asked.

Richter pointed with his moonstone short sword, “Looks like Caulder is already taking care of that pussy. Besides, he’ll have plenty of help.” He sent some mental orders and then rejoined the front line. After swinging his blades ferociously for a few seconds, a hole opened in the goblin line. The wild troll was only fifty yards away and was barreling down on a section of his people far to the right. The chaos seed screamed a challenge, though, and the monster bellowed back. It changed the direction of its charge and bore down on him, trampling goblins in its path. Richter nodded slightly and thought, let’s do this.

The chaos seed used Analyze, hoping for some clue as to how to defeat the horror bearing down on him.

Name: Mountain Troll Disposition: Hatred

Mountain trolls are a wild predecessor of more evolved trolls. Though lacking in intellect, they more than make up for it in ferocity and regenerative capabilities. Mountain trolls can heal almost any injury, and this capability is even further enhanced by feeding on bloody flesh. They have an instinctual hatred for all creatures. Even when mating, one of the two is normally killed, or at the very least, heavily damaged.

Well, that helped fuckall, he thought with irritation. Good to know that it’s an unstoppable killing machine that only gets stronger when it eats us! Still, if it was to be done, best to be done quickly! He ran at the wild troll, raising one sword. The chaos seed had pushed beyond the goblin line, but the battle had degraded to a brawl, and clear lines were hard to find. Sion was right behind him.

Richter’s left short sword was raised high, but at the last minute, he ducked low, aiming to chop through the troll’s leg. Richter executed a nearly flawless Reaping Wheat. His moonstone blade bit into the troll’s leg followed by his Sonic Elementum Short Sword. Both cut deep but failed to sever the tree trunk-thick limb.

It screamed, more in rage than anger. Richter reversed his blades to finish the amputation. Before he could attack again, though, one of the troll’s oversized hands struck him hard in the chest. Its black claws scored against his chest plate, but thanks to his new gaseous form, Richter avoided being impaled. The troll’s hand hit as hard as a warhammer, and the chaos seed went spinning through the air. He landed behind fifteen feet away and knocked down two of his own healers.

“Shitttt,” he moaned. That had gone horribly! Richter got back to his feet, though and ran back into the fray.

Meanwhile, the panther had dealt elegantly with the shield wall facing it. The damn thing had jumped over it! In the space of seconds, it had killed two aeromancers and one biomage with sweeps of its terrible claws. The villagers rallied, but the shield wall was broken. Richter’s guards fought back against it, but even their enchanted blades did little damage against its magically strengthened fur and skin. Caulder led the counterassault, his body hazy from having imbibed a Potion of Gaseous Form, but even his heavy mace had little effect.

The goblins were not wasting the opportunity. They attacked with renewed vigor, wearing the defenders down. Caught between the deadly panther and the bloodthirsty goblins, Richter’s people began to die.

The troll was wreaking devastation as well. Its insanely high strength and absolute disregard for damage had let it cut deep into the villagers’ ranks. So deep in fact that the shield wall had been able to reform and the allied forces were able to form a cohesive defense against the goblins and their troll allies.

Guards back from the front line continued to face the mountain troll with shields, but each swing of its preternaturally long arms knocked men back and sometimes caused major damage. Sion and Terrod were occupying its attention now, both of their bodies hazy, as Richter leaped back into the fray. The agile sprite was moving as quickly as possible, stabbing the troll here and there. The wounds inflicted with his poisoned short sword took longer to heal than other injuries, but the troll’s flesh was still closing. The poison had also worn off, and now Sion was doing little more than annoying it. Meanwhile, the goblins and troll mercenaries were bearing down on village soldiers as well. If not for the withering fire of the sprites, the guards would most likely have been in full rout.

Sion’s luck finally ran out, and he took a hard swipe on the side. Just like Richter, the sprite went spinning end over end and landed in a heap. The troll turned its attention to another one of the meidon sprites. It struck savagely, and the sprite went down with a cry. Red blood dripped from the ends of its claws. It reached down and pulled the sprite’s arm free, shoving the limb in its mouth, armor and all. As it chewed, its wounds started closing faster than before. The meidon sprite lay on the ground, shock having already set in. Another swipe of the troll’s claws ended his life and, miles away, a pixie screamed and went feral.

Richter got closer to the troll and saw that the wound he had inflicted on its leg was still open, but it was barely bleeding and was half as large as it should have been. The troll had turned its full attention on the captain. Terrod was completely on the defensive. His high steel kite shield was held up in front of him, but the troll’s fifty-two points of Strength were like boulders falling from the sky. Other guards were stabbing and striking the troll, but it didn’t even notice, fully intent on killing Richter’s Companion.

The chaos seed was about to dive back into battle when something caught his eye. It was a detail he hadn’t noticed before, but as the troll reared up to scream in rage, Richter saw a glint on the creature’s neck. His identification Talent activated and suddenly he possessed in-depth information about the enchanted item.

You have found:

Trollium Collar of Submission

Durability: 112/267

Item Class: Scarce

Quality: Well Crafted

Weight: 0.7 kg

Traits: If you manage to collar a monster with this item, they will become your slave. The monster will be unable to harm you and will strictly follow your commands. Can only be used once.





Richter’s eyes widened. He had assumed that the troll soldiers had tamed the beast or that they had some type of racial magic to make it fight on their side. It turned out it was much more simple. It also gave him an absolutely horrible idea.

The chaos seed ran at the troll’s back and jumped as high as he could. One blade plunged into the monster’s back. The troll roared and turned quickly. Richter’s legs flew out to the side as if he and the troll were a spinning top, but he maintained his grip. With a hard pull, Richter leveraged himself closer to the monster and slammed his second blade even higher into the troll’s back.

Once again, everything seemed to stop for a moment, and all sound faded away. An inane, possibly insane, part of his brain noted that this was the second time he had climbed using his weapons in the past two days. He really had to get some of those climbing claws. The world sped back up, and the troll’s rage-filled scream filled his ears.

The monster reached back to grab him. Richter let go of his lower weapon and rotated his body to the side. Its claws gouged furrows in its own back, but it missed the chaos seed. Richter’s finger wove in a specific configuration, and he spat a word of Power. Flames shot from his hand and into the troll’s questing one. The monster shrieked in anger and yanked its claw away. The chaos seed thanked his lucky stars that the myths about trolls hating flame seemed to be true.

Richter wasted no more time. He pulled his dagger from his belt. He used his short sword as an anchor and pulled himself up again, before plunging his dagger into the troll’s shoulder. He let go of his second short sword and reached into his bag. Praying for a better result this time, the chaos seed whipped the Quicksilver Collar of Submission around the troll’s neck. The two ends of the collar quested for one another, driven to fulfill its purpose of dominating another creature’s will. The silvery metal moved around the monster’s neck… and clicked into place!

The troll went ballistic. Richter was shaken free from his precarious perch, not even noticing the ghostly silver ring that appeared on his thumb. Within a second, it solidified into a plain quicksilver band. The chaos seed fell to the ground, barely keeping his feet. The troll immediately reached for him, bellowing in anger. With the claws scant feet from his face, he flung one arm out and shouted, “Stop!”

The mountain troll froze. A cold sensation on Richter’s left hand made him glance down and see the ethereal ring for the first time, but his gaze shot right back up to the monster. Richter wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but it what happened next was shocking. It screamed. It wasn’t a bellow, a yell, or even a roar. It screamed in pure and utter agony!

The high pitch noise escaping monster’s throat was bone chilling. It began to tear at its own flesh while two opposing magics used its body as a battleground. Though the monster’s claws came near its own neck, a magical field sprung up around the collars protecting them from the enslaved creature. Both collars, one of fluid silver and the other of green-steel, began to glow red and sparks shot between them. Richter felt like he was watching a battle in space!

The chaos seed’s identification Talent went into overdrive. The durability on both collars plummeted. Richter couldn’t even be sure which collar was winning, the numbers fell so quickly. Within seconds, though, the trollium necklace broke off and fell to the ground. The sudden magical feedback in the collar caused the accompanying ring to explode. One of the troll mercenaries fell to the ground with a scream of his own as his hand exploded and his arm was engulfed in flame.

Richter smiled at the sound. Should have paid for the quicksilver model, asshole! His soldiers looked at the mountain troll in trepidation, but they relaxed after he shouted, “Bend down!” and the mountain troll did as it was told. The chaos seed smiled as he retrieved his weapons from its body. He looked around at his fighters and shouted, “Well, get back in there! We’ve got a battle to win, don’t we?” They cheered and dove back at the goblins and trolls with a vengeance.

An enemy Champion has been converted! -100 Fighting Spirit for enemy forces for the duration of the battle! +50 Fighting Spirit for allied forces for the duration of the battle!

The prompt was auto-minimized to the side due to Richter being in battle, but his soldiers’ response was proof of its truth.

“Fight for Lord Richter! Lord Richter and the Mist Village!





CHAPTER 40 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter cast Minor Slow Heal on the mountain troll. The damage it had taken as the collars warred for dominance was prodigious. It was true that it could heal on its own, but he needed it at fighting strength immediately. There was still a battle to be won. The chaos seed looked to the left, intending to send the troll to fight the Druid’s pet, but was incredibly pleased to see that the battle was not going as badly as he thought. The decaemur knight had entered the field of battle.

The undead creature’s broadsword was sticking out of the cat’s shoulder. Blood flowed freely from the wound, but the panther was barely slowed. The knight currently had both hands on the sides of the cat’s mouth. The cat was straining forward to rend the decaemur with its jaws, and the knight was slowly being forced back, but they were more or less at a stalemate, at least for the moment. Arrows stuck out of the panther’s fur, but they had little to no effect.

Just like the troll, the panther had moved well behind the front line. Richter’s forces had been able to reform a cohesive defense, centered around Yoshi and Caulder, but that left precious few guards to keep fighting the cat. Richter watched, confused for a moment because something was missing. Then a broad grin crossed his face. His own pet had arrived!

The shale adder, perfectly matching the grass it had slithered through, shot up from right beneath the panther. The snake had moved unseen through the cat’s own legs! Richter’s tamed creature latched its six-inch fangs onto the cat’s neck and yanked for all it was worth. The decaemur knight tightened its grip on the panther’s mouth and pulled at the same time. The Druid’s pet crashed to the ground, and the adder started wrapping its body around the panther’s neck, choking off its air supply. That was all Alma had been waiting for. She descended from where she had been hovering, and a golden glow surrounded her body. A few seconds later, she finished casting Summon Weak Gold Fox. A golden disc disgorged the Life creature, and Alma latched onto the cat’s head, committing to her special attack!

Richter sent his now enslaved mountain troll to wreak havoc among its more “civilized” brethren. The monster knocked down several guardsmen as it rushed to fulfill his order. None of them seemed too hurt, but one gnome vomited from having the wind knocked out of him. The chaos seed made a mental note to send the guard a fruit basket when they got back, but he couldn’t help but grin savagely as the troll attacked its former masters.

The sprites were continuing to rain death on the rear ranks of the goblins. If not for the spider traps bottlenecking the enemy, the allied forces might have been overrun, but the courage of the Mist Village soldiers was felt by the goblins in every sword swing and mace blow. The third attack wave of the goblins had failed! The allied forces had paid a heavy price, but hundreds of goblins lay dead and dying, and their bodies had even created a fleshy bulwark in front of Richter’s people in places. The two armies had to climb over the dead to continue their fight in places, and the victors stood high while the losers rolled to the bottom like so much trash.

The mountain troll was exacting a heavy toll from its former masters. The trolls were almost completely wiped out, and even the panther was almost conquered! The cat had gotten back to its feet, but each of its breaths was a hacking wheeze as it strangled to death. No surprise seeing as how twenty feet of adder was wrapped around its neck and body. Richter indulged in a moment of smug superiority. Buffed or not, the panther still needed air, and his own tamed pet was proving its match. The chaos seed had a feeling the Druid would regret sending his pet so deep into enemy territory!

Unfortunately, he was right.

The final reserves of the goblin army had joined the battle minutes ago. That included Heqht-jo who was currently exchanging blows with Yoshi. Both Professionals had destroyed the soldiers of the other side, but once they locked eyes, they had known only one of them would live to see the sunset. Yoshi had raised one blade in salute, and the battle was joined!

Radg-or and the other goblin mages had also gotten close enough to the battling armies to cast their spells. Bolts of black lightning, spheres of acid and rays of Death energy began to descend upon the allied forces! The Druid himself was casting a spell that was causing the clouds to darken above him.

The allied forces quailed before the magical onslaught, but then Hisako and the sprite magi entered the battle! The five mages supporting her began casting counterspells. The bolts of necrotic energy fizzled out, the lightning was redirected to strike the ground harmlessly, and walls of earth rose to block the acid globes. Hisako focused on the Druid.

Radg-or’s spell completed, and lightning began to crackle across the sky. The Hearth mother cast two Earth spells in quick succession. The first, Spire of Iron, made a thirty-foot high spike of black metal rise from the ground. The second, Superior Earth Shield (Active), erected a powerful sphere of protection around herself and one other mage who kept his hand on her shoulder, feeding her mana. The protection was specifically attuned to resist the Air magic the Druid was summoning.

Hisako’s globe appeared just in time. The first bolt of lightning struck the spire a second later, followed in quick succession by twenty more. Instead of savaging the allied forces, the lightning was spilled into the ground and into the Hearth Mother’s shield. She winced slightly at having to feed mana into her active spell, but her protection held. The sky began to clear, and both she and her support mage downed blue mana potions. The Druid stared across the field at her with hate in his heart. The pale red glow in his eyes deepened to crimson, and he pulled deeply from the Bloodstone’s mana.

While the Druid prepared his next attack, the fighting grew furious between the two armies. Richter and Sion battled side by side. The chaos seed blocked an overhand swing with his moonstone short sword, and Sion opened the goblin fighter belly to balls with his elementum blade. The sprite cast Weak Lightning Bolt at a grinder who blocked with his shield. The damage was decreased, but the goblin was still stunned for a crucial second. Another allied soldier stabbed the green skinned creature in the leg causing him to fall back with a cry when the Stun status wore off.

The goblins grew to fear Richter’s blades. Periodically, the Disarm enchantment on his elementum short sword would fire, and whatever goblin he was facing was left without a weapon. It became a common one-two punch. The goblin was left partially unprotected, and then the enemy encountered the horror of his Dense Moonstone Short Sword of Goblin Slaying. The merest touch of the blade drew wheals on their green skin, and Richter was not being gentle. Massive rents appeared in the bodies of the goblins he faced, and his entire front was drenched in black blood.

Then Richter fought his first troll Warrior. They eyed each other for a moment that Richter used to Analyze his foe.

Name: VuzembiRace: TrollDisposition: DistasteProfession: Warrior

Trolls are more evolved than their wild cousins. They still possess modest health regeneration, but it is much weaker than their ancestors. The sacrifice has not been in vain, however, as troll society can be as evolved as any human kingdom. Trading has been known to occur with other races but is unlikely for two reasons. One, due to their martial prowess, warfare has become almost a racial pastime. Two, even goblins are considered handsome compared to frightening visage of trolls. Trolls gain three points to distribute per level, and each level gives +2 to Constitution. Due to their regenerative capabilities, “cutting” is a popular practice among troll mothers to increase the Constitution of their children.

Richter’s face paled slightly at seeing the troll’s insanely high Constitution. The fact that he had a couple of rings augmenting his stats and what looked to be sturdy armor didn’t help. It was somewhat of a surprise that the troll’s disposition towards him wasn’t lower than “distaste,” but he supposed that to the mercenary, he was just a payday.

The troll saw his hesitation and smiled while hoisting both shield and mace. Richter snarled back, “Keep laughing, asshole!”

The merc swung his mace in a mighty blow, left to right. The chaos seed dodged back and counterattacked with Samara Seed Falling. The troll had immediately reset his stance, however, and both of Richter’s whirling blades encountered only the mercenary’s shield. The green-skinned Warrior activated a Talent, Shield Bash. His steel shield struck Richter fully in the face. The chaos seed was knocked down onto his back and blood gushed out of his nose. The Warrior brought his mace down, but Richter caught the weapon in the “V” of his crossed blades as he spat his own blood. Richter’s lips twisted in a bloody smile when the Disarm enchantment fired from his blade, and the mace was cast upward.

Richter got to his feet. As he did, he was shocked to see the troll had somehow maintained a grip on his weapon. The Warrior had needed to stumble back several feet in order to arrest its movement, but still, his Strength was enough to keep the handle in his grip! The troll brought his weapon back in front of him and reset his shield. Then a gloating expression took over his face. He insulted Richter in his native language. Then in heavily accented common tongue, he said, “You will have to do better than weak enchantments, human.”

Congratulations! You have learned: Trollish.

In perfect command of his new tongue, Richter replied, “Whatever you say, fugly!”

It was the troll’s turn to look surprised, and that expression only worsened as Richter pointed a fist and unleashed Grease from spell storage. The mercenary went down along with three of his fellows. Both swords went back into their sheaths on Richter’s back in one fluid motion, and the chaos seed spoke a word of Power. Flames shot from his fingertips and ignited the grease patch. All four trolls started screaming as they cooked.

A quick check showed that the charges on his weapons were almost depleted. Richter stepped back from the front lines to survey the battle and used some soul stones to recharge. The troll mercenaries outclassed his own soldiers in levels and training. The village healers, enchanted weapons, and potions made up a good bit of the difference, though.

The mountain troll had already ripped apart a few dozen of the mercs, and the meidon sprites had joined the battle. Richter had made it a point that each of them were equipped with enchanted weapons. While his villager guards might have been overwhelmed, the sprites were giving as good as they got. Injuries were piling up on both sides, but the meidon sprites were bolstered by the healing magic of the biomages.

Yoshi and Heqht-jo continued to trade blows. The Barbarian bled in multiple spots, but a red haze surrounded him, and he seemed completely unaware of any injury. Meanwhile, he swung his giant axe as if it was as light as a feather. Again and again, Yoshi missed death by a hairsbreadth. The press of the battle separated the two of them, but the Barbarian shouted threats at the adept the whole time.

The magical battle also continued to rage. Two of the sprites’ mages were on the ground, and one had smoke rising from his charred form. Four of the goblins casters were dead in contrast, and the last was suffering under an onslaught of magic and arrows. None of the weaker magi were as important as the Druid, however. With a shout of arcane syllables, he finished his latest spell, Horrid Blight of Tantalus.

A grey streamer of mist shot from the Druid’s hands. It split and split and split again. Within seconds, hundreds of tendrils of grey mist were shooting across the battlefield and entering the mouths of almost everyone in the allied forces. It didn’t matter how they moved or if their mouths were closed, the magic took hold.

The soldiers quailed and five lost their lives in the first second, distracted by the soft tissues of their throats desiccating in an instant. To Sion, it brought back horrible memories of having to relive his childhood friend’s death over and over. To Richter, it felt as if he had never drunk a cup of water before in his life. Prompts appeared and were minimized in Richter’s vision.

You are Blighted!

You are Dehydrated! Any lost health cannot be restored.

You are Severely Dehydrated! Ten health lost per second!

Richter’s vision began to blur. He kept fighting, but he could feel his exertions worsening his dehydration. The chaos seed’s joints ached, and his insides felt like they had been replaced with sand. Only the beasts and the undead seemed unaffected. Alma, the shale adder, the knight and the puma continued their deadly struggle. To Richter’s left and right, his soldiers struggled to battle on as their very life was stolen by the Druid’s fell magic. He kept fighting, but in his heart, he knew that hope was gone. It had been banished by the might of the Bloodstone.

Then Hisako raised her arm. A light appeared over them all, reminding enemies and allies alike that a Master of Light, Earth, and Life was present. Her magical sphere had protected her from the worst of the blight, but now she dropped it and stood tall. The Hearth Mother downed a Fortify Mana potion. She had kept it in reserve for many years, but knew that now was the time. Her mana pool increased by another nine hundred and seventy-two points. The spell she was casting would require all she had and more.

She continued to keep her arm pointed at the golden light in the sky, and it grew as she fed mana into the spell. No words of Power spilled from her lips, and she made no motions for this casting. This spell was unique to her Place of Power, and it had been won by sacrifice and battle. She had never cast it beyond the bounds of her domain, but for her people, she would do anything.

Hisako unleashed her thousands of points of mana and took more besides. Her support mage collapsed senseless, his mana completely drained. Her other magi stumbled closer, their health falling quickly, but each placed a hand on her. She took their magic and fed it to her spell. The mote of light had become a golden mass that shimmered in the dawn light. One moment it was a sphere made of golden satin and the next, the walls of the globe flexed and became concave, then convex. The Hearth Mother herself almost began to swoon. Deep inside herself, she began to despair. Her spell required so much more mana this far from a Life ley line! Then the iron will that defined her mercilessly crushed her traitorous doubts. She did not stop. The other magi all dropped within seconds as she continued to funnel every mote of mana in her body. Then, it happened. She finished the spell.

The Hearth Mother cast Portal to Narina. The roar of a lion echoed out over the battlefield, and every debuff, curse and negative effect was removed from all present, enemy and ally alike. Everyone with a positive alignment immediately gained four hundred health, even if their Constitution was less than forty. Finally, any who had died in the past minute was brought back to life! Dozens of human, elves, gnomes, sprites and dwarves sucked in air that they never thought they would taste again. Eyes opened, wounds closed, and hands clasped hilts once more.

Richter’s mind was once again flooded with information.

All debuffs and negative effects removed!

You are no longer Blighted!

You are no longer Severely Dehydrated! You are no longer Dehydrated!

You have received +400 Health!

Know This! The sudden turn of events has significantly increased the Fighting Spirit of your forces! FS increased by +1000! FS Rank increased from Violent (+20% Damage) to Ruthless (+30% Damage).

Richter became aware of these facts simultaneously and, once again, learned that words were not idle in The Land. A ferocity built in his breast and a scream of rage welled up in his throat. All along the allied line, his battle cry was echoed, and the fighting began again!

The chaos seed blocked a blow aimed at a revived elf still trying to get up. His short sword stopped the strike cold, and with an incoherent bellow he hacked at the troll. His elementum short sword cleaved clean through the mercenary’s arm, chainmail and all. He then stabbed up with the form Crane’s Neck. His moonstone blade entered the troll’s neck. With a savage twist, he decapitated the troll, a wound it would never regenerate. Green blood geysered from the neck, drenching him in even more filth than he was covered in before. Richter didn’t notice, except to be slightly surprised at the faint cinnamon taste of the troll blood on his lips. The chaos seed searched for his next victim.

Yoshi had taken a grievous wound to the chest while under the influence of the Druid’s spell. His sprite armor had a diagonal gash where the barbarian’s axe had finally struck him. The adept’s health had been restored with Hisako’s spell, but his bent armor still stuck into his skin. He rolled clear of another attack by Heqht-jo and stood. With a control born of decades of sword practice, the adept sliced through the straps of his own armor in two precise sword strikes. The breastplate fell to the ground. Without the metal from his own ruined armor piercing his skin, the excess health given by the portal to Narina healed the last bleeding wounds on his chest.

Yoshi stared at the Barbarian. The adept drove one sword into the ground, ripped off the remains of his ruined shirt and reclaimed his blade. Bare-chested, he faced at Heqht-jo holding two rapiers the color of a pale blue glacier.

“Come!” the enemy commander said in goblin-speak, beckoning his racial foe closer. He knew that the end had come for one of them and was eager for it to be done. This one time, Yoshi found himself in complete agreement with a goblin. The adept set one foot back into a staggered stance, one blade extended and the other arched over his head like a scorpion’s stinger.

Heqht-jo exhaled in frustration, “Come on you forest r-”

The goblin never finished his thought.

The sword adept moved forward, his form a blur. Both blades struck against the goblin’s battle axe. Not against the head, but the haft. His ice rapiers cut through two of the Barbarian’s fingers. Heqht-jo roared and triggered his last remaining Rage. Red energy began to flow off of his body again while his speed, health, endurance and damage increased by a factor of four. He wasn’t the only one to use a Talent, however. Yoshi activated his most powerful attack, Flurry of Blades.

There was a reason that the sword adept seldom used Talents in battle. He used his precious Talent points to increase his overall fighting abilities rather than simply rely on what he called “tricks.” Lunge, Bash, Thrust and other Talents could be useful, but to Yoshi, a true Warrior relied on his skill and the strength of his arm. Still, he was not a fool, and twenty-seven Talent points had gone to purchasing this one attack.

Time slowed for Yoshi, and for the next three seconds, he moved faster than a diving hawk. His blades moved so quickly that it appeared that Heqht-jo was facing not two swords, but twenty. Rage made the Barbarian deadly, but Yoshi’s Talent was not just an attack. It drastically increased the innate skill of the Warrior. When that Warrior was Yoshi, a man who had spent decades honing his technique, Flurry of Blades was nearly unstoppable.

The Talent was not without cost. The three-second attack drained 45% of Yoshi’s stamina. After having already battled countless enemies, less than 5% of his green bar remained when the attack ended. In melee battle, stamina was the same as fuel in a car race. If your stamina ran out… you died. Yoshi had taken a serious chance using his Talent, but it paid off. Again and again, the adept’s weapons struck the barbarian… in only two places. Seconds later, the world sped back up, and the Barbarian was left to looking dumbfounded at his partially severed arms. Both forearms flopped, half cut away from his body.

The Barbarian looked up at the Warrior who had bested him in confusion. It had never actually entered the goblin’s mind that he would lose to a sprite. “But,” he began.

His face calm, Yoshi just shook his head and softly whispered “shhh,” as a father would to console a crying babe. Then his blade flashed and took the goblin’s head. The muscular body fell to the ground and black blood fountained into the air. So ended the story of Heqht-jo.





CHAPTER 41 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Know This! As a War Leader under the command of War Leader Yoshi, you may benefit from his knowledge of the enemy. The sudden turn of events has greatly decreased the Fighting Spirit of the enemy forces!

The enemy War Leader has been slain! There is no other War Leader to replace him. -4000 to the Fighting Spirit of goblin forces. -1000 to the Fighting Spirit of troll forces.

FS Rank of goblins decreased from Violent (+20% Damage) to Unnerved (-20% Damage).

FS Rank of trolls decreased from Ruthless (+30% Damage) to Violent (+20% Damage).

The goblins broke. Barely over a hundred of them remained, and the creatures were cowards at heart, just as the sprites had said. The field was littered with their dead. They scrabbled over each other in an effort to run. Some even pushed their fellows into the spider traps in their haste. The allied forces pursued. The villagers, some of whom had never known battle before, were changed. They bellowed in greedy bloodlust, cutting their foes down from behind.

The troll mercenaries were much less affected by Heqht-jo’s death, but still understood that they had lost. More than half their number lay dead. A dozen more were badly wounded. Even with their regenerative ability, they would not be back in fighting form for hours or days. The mountain troll had taken a terrible toll on them, though now it lay dead. All four of its arms and legs had been hacked off, and an axe was still embedded in its skull, the haft sticking up into the air.

One of the remaining troll sergeants blew into a horn, two staccato notes and one long. Absolutely professional, they disengaged from the allied forces and took several steps back. Their shields and weapons were still in front of them, but they made no aggressive moves. One called out “Peace!” Terrod ordered the allied forces to stand down, and an uneasy stalemate was born.

Richter looked around, and for just a second, he thought that things might work out. They had crushed the goblins, forced their troll allies to surrender, and the biomancers were already downing more mana potions to heal the allied forces. He allowed himself a moment of hope. After what happened next, he realized he should probably learn the lesson of not tempting fate.

The battle might have ended at that moment. Even the Druid, Radg-or, was ready to quit the field. He reasoned that if he returned home with the Bloodstone, it would still allow him to save at least some face in goblin society. Heqht-jo had been the one in charge after all. He could blame the entire loss on the Barbarian’s temper. Amidst all of the blood, death, and pain of the battlefield, though, one more fight was still raging.

The panther had clawed the shale adder horribly, but the summoned Life fox had healed most of the damage before fading away. The adder was bleeding in spots, but its health was almost completely preserved. Despite the massive buffs on the puma, the fight had been over as soon as Richter’s tamed snake had gotten a deathlock around the cat’s neck. The undead knight had continued to attack, chipping away at its health, and Alma had remained attached to its head. With a last feeble swipe at the snake choking it to death, the puma fell to its side and lay still.

Since the first creature had been born to The Land, blood had become the medium of life, passion, and rage. The death of the panther broke something inside Radg-or. A voice that he had heard since first touching the Bloodstone, a voice that at first he had refused to admit even existed, increased in volume from a whisper to a shout. <<They have killed your beloved pet, Radg-or! They rejoice even now. Give yourself to me, and you will have vengeance. Honor the sacrifice of Scor. Give yourself to me!>>

Only the Druid could hear the voice, but to him, it was as loud as a howling hurricane. At the same time, it was as seductive as a lover’s dark whisper. Since Radg-or had first touched it, the Bloodstone had been slowly exerting more control over the caster. Its approach was insidious and fueled by a confidence born of having corrupted countless magi through the millennia. The death of Scor left the Druid spiritually vulnerable, though. The Bloodstone struck ruthlessly and without hesitation, feeding upon and manipulating Radg-or’s loss. The goblin’s will crumpled and he relinquished himself completely to the Bloodstone’s malevolent will.

The Druid’s personality was immediately suppressed. What replaced it was a will that had existed since the gods had walked The Land. The black blood in the goblin’s veins grew hot. Every artery, vein, and capillary could now be seen standing in stark relief against his leathery green skin. The greatest change was to his eyes which no longer simply glowed red. They had changed completely.

Smooth round stones sat in each of his eye sockets, the same red color as the sentient item. The fact that the goblin lacked Blood magic still limited the Bloodstone’s powers, but the orb had enough power to destroy the rabble in front of it. Once everyone on the field of battle was sacrificed to fuel its magic, the stone could begin fulfilling its mandate again. It was true that the body of the Druid would burn out in mere weeks, but by then it could simply secure another vessel. Magi were always easy targets. The Bloodstone had learned long ago that those who manipulated power were easily seduced by the promise of more.

Taking over the Druid’s body took only seconds. Then it turned its gaze toward the fleeing goblins, the pursuing allied soldiers, and the troll mercenaries. They would all add to its power. The Bloodstone accessed the caster’s strongest magic, a spell Radg-or had never had the skill level or the willpower to fully master. For the age-old stone, casting it was child’s play.

The Bloodstone floated into the air. It settled into place one foot above the possessed Druid’s head. The relic shone with a baleful light, promising death to all who dared look upon its majesty. The entity inhabiting the caster’s body began to move both arms whilst words of Power spilled from its lips. Yellow light appeared on both its hands. The hue of the light shifted to red, green, blue, and back to yellow while it cast the Talent-purchased spell, Storm of Judgement.

The active spell was only limited by the mana and skill of the caster. The sky began to darken again and devastation fell from the sky. All of the elemental forces of the Druid’s Profession descended like a verdict from heaven. Spheres of ice that Froze enemies on contact, balls of fire that made goblins Burn, bolts of lightning that Stunned and golf ball sized rocks that Poisoned anyone unlucky enough to be near the impact craters began to fall from the sky.

The frequency and the strength of the attacks increased as the Bloodstone fed more mana into the spell. It expended the life energy of more than twenty sacrificial victims to advance to the second rank of the spell. Each level that the spell reached made it more powerful, but also cost exponentially more than the rank before. The strength of the spell began at weak, but within seconds it had progressed to minor. Even from the beginning, though, weak was a misnomer.

The spell’s AoE began in the middle of the battlefield, so it was the goblins trapped in the webs that were struck first. The lucky ones stayed unconscious as they were burned, frozen, poisoned, and electrocuted. The falling balls of fire began to burn through the webs, but any goblins hoping for freedom found it to be a false hope. Soon every one of them that could still scream was raising his voice in agony, victims of the Bloodstone’s spell. The AoE expanded as the spell grew in power.

The black clouds flashed with the colors of the four elements, yellow, blue, red and green. The flares came faster and faster, bursts of light accompanied by ear-splitting claps of thunder. The wind picked up from a breeze to a gale in less than a minute, until no one could hear even the shout of their comrades. Everyone on the battlefield looked up at the maelstrom in fear, but none felt terror as much as the fleeing goblins. Suddenly, their escape route was cut off, and they were confronted with a terrible choice; death by magic or death by blade.

Caulder blew on his horn, signaling a halt to his soldier’s advance. It could barely be heard over the wind, but the villagers started a hurried retreat away from the magical onslaught. Their shields and weapons remained pointed at their enemies, but they backed away from the Bloodstone’s spell as quickly as they could.

The goblins, lacking any leadership, did not fare as well. They scattered. A few tried to run through the magical maelstrom, but none of them were fast enough. They died in seconds. Soon, the living goblins were stuck staring at charred, frozen, crushed and bloated bodies of their comrades. They all came to the same conclusion. There was only one choice. The remnants of the goblin army charged toward the shield wall of the villagers, some screaming, many panicked, and all hopeless.

Caulder blew on his horn again, one long blast, and the villagers stopped their retreat. While madness fell from the sky, the shield wall reformed and they prepared to receive the attack. Goblins threw themselves at the soldiers, without plan or strategy. That is where they died. Many of the guard’s weapons were depleted of enchantment, but they didn’t need magic to finish the battle. The goblins were bashed, cleaved and pierced.

They fell in bloody messes and were trampled by their fellows wanting to escape the spell’s torment as well. Soon, the goblin army lay in utter devastation. When the last goblin died, Richter, Sion and all of the other allied forces sprinted towards the tree line. When they got there, they were greeted with the unhappy sight of unconscious bodies. Hisako and all of her magi lay in a mana-drained torpor.

“What happened!” Richter screamed over the wind.

“The last spell took everything from her!” Yoshi shouted back.

“I’ll carry her!” the chaos seed shouted. “We need to get the fuck out of here!”

Yoshi shook his head and held up a hand against the dust and dirt the storm was kicking up, “We will never make it to safety! Did you see that goblin caster? Hisako warned me of what it means when the vessels stand stark against the skin! The Bloodstone has taken control! It will keep feeding this storm until it runs out of mana or we are all dead! Look at how quickly it is growing! We cannot outrun it!”

“He is right!” Sion shouted. “The ravine will just funnel the storm’s attack! With our wounded, and having to carry the Hearth Mother, we will be killed! The pass is about to become a death trap!”

“Then what do we do?” Richter cried back. His soldiers had taken refuge amongst the trees. Those with shields were holding them in front of their faces. Even the surviving troll mercenaries had sheltered among the trunks a hundred yards away. No one even thought about continuing the battle. They could all see the form of the possessed Druid, glowing red like a torch on the other side of the storm.

Yoshi looked at the chaos seed, “We only have one choice!”

Richter looked at him in confusion then widened his eyes. He pointed at the storm. “You want to go through that?” he asked incredulously. The chaos seed looked out at the battlefield. The dead bodies were getting pummeled. Though he didn’t know it, the Bloodstone had funneled enough mana into the storm that it had progressed from minor to common. The size of the elemental attacks falling from the sky had grown larger, and they were falling faster than ever before. There were plenty of spaces that weren’t being hit with the elemental attacks in any given moment, but entering the storm and making it to the other side would just be a matter of luck.

“I will not fail the Hearth Mother! I will kill the caster and destroy the Bloodstone!” Yoshi shouted fiercely. The adept cinched tight the straps that held his swords in place on his back. “You do not have to come!” The storm was getting stronger. Even back in the trees it was getting hard to hear Yoshi from five feet away.

Richter cursed and looked at Sion. His best friend just looked back grimly. Then he reminded the chaos seed why they were best friends. With a cocky smile on his face, he shouted, “You have to admit the goblin’s spell is pretty impressive! I mean, how did he even learn it? How?”

The chaos seed sighed. He closed his eyes and hung his head. After a moment, though, he looked up at Sion with a wry and resigned grin of his own. “Well, fuck! Let’s go ask him!”





CHAPTER 42 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





Richter drank one of his remaining potions of luck. He also handed one to both Yoshi and Sion. Then he and Sion both cast Weak Haste on themselves. One of the village aeromancers did the same for Yoshi. Richter also took the time to cast every other buff he could, Weak Barkskin and Weak Life Armor. After that, it was just a matter of hoping that their Potions of Gaseous Form would offer some protection from the attacks. A few seconds later, they were running!

There was no magical field or transition point to let them know once they had crossed into the AoE of the Druid’s spell. The first indication was a fist-sized stone falling ten yards to Richter’s right. It sunk into the ground; the impact crater five yards across. Green gas came up from each crack that had been created, evidence that the stone was poisoned. Richter gritted his teeth and kept running.

*Master! What are you doing?* Alma’s voice echoed in his mind. The panic she felt at seeing him run into the maelstrom carried through in her mental tone. It was a conversation Richter hadn’t wanted to have. Despite his joking with his friend and Yoshi, he knew that this would most likely mean his death. The second time he had died had been much more traumatic than the first, and it had taken him longer to come back. He didn’t want to think about what toll his third death would take. He didn’t want to think about what would happen to his familiar if he did not come back at all.

*I am doing what I have to, my love,* he thought to her tenderly. *Fly back to the trees and stay out of the storm.*

*Master, I can help you! I am much faster now. If I-*

*No!* he thought to her fiercely. *Stay out of the storm! As your master, I order you to obey me!* He hated exerting his will over her, but Richter wouldn’t risk her fragile body A bolt of lightning struck the ground only yards in front of him, reaffirming his resolve. The shock transmitted through the ground, but his high Air resistance kept him on his feet. Richter kept running, but guilt ate at him for having spoken to Alma so harshly. With love in his heart, he sent her a final message, *I may not make it through this, love, but I promise, I will come back to you.*

No response came. He was going to speak to her again, but another falling rock forced him to dive to the side. Richter focused on the task at hand, silently wishing her well, come what may. He, Yoshi and Sion had spread out as they ran, to minimize the chance that one magical attack could take them all out. Before they had started running, Yoshi had given a simple command. “No one stops.” The message was clear. If one of them went down, the others were not to help. They all knew this would most likely be a one-way trip.

Richter was the first to go down. A bolt of freezing energy shot down from the sky and hit his leg. The chaos seed had experienced many different types of pain since coming to The Land. The elemental attack was nowhere near the worst, but it was horrifying in its own way. He tried to keep running and went down in a tumble. It was only then that he looked down and saw that his entire right leg had been flash frozen. From the thigh down, the limb had adopted the blue-white color of ice. The water crystals sparkled in the light. Richter cried out in disbelief.

Another firebomb fell from the sky close by. A piece of flame splattered onto his face. The burning pain brought him out of his shock. Richter realized that if this spell acted like his enchantment, then his leg would thaw sometime soon. If it was permanent, then there was nothing he could do. Either way, he needed to survive the next few moments.

Richter started casting, and a few seconds later, a sphere of green light sprung into place around him. Elemental attacks continued to rain from the sky. A bolt of lightning fell almost directly upon his protective sphere, but thankfully the Air attack was stopped by his shield. Richter could see that the durability of his shell dropped substantially, but he remained protected. The chaos seed just prayed that a rock didn’t fall on his shield. The Earth attack would cut right through his protection like it wasn’t even there.

After long seconds, his leg did indeed start to thaw. It brought with it a pins and needles type of pain that was almost worse than the freezing, but Richter didn’t complain. He cast Weak Slow Heal to replenish his lost health and got into a sprinter’s stance. A moment later, the Freeze status effect disappeared from his interface. Richter sprung forward. As soon as he touched his own shield, it disappeared, and he was off again.

Sion and Yoshi had issues of their own. A fire bomb had exploded near Sion, burning his left side. The sprite had immediately dropped and rolled, smothering the flames and gotten back on his feet. He was still moving, but much slower and every step was agony. Yoshi had suffered the misfortune of running through the impact crater of a poisoned stone. Now the adept hacked bloody phlegm while he ran and his health bar had turned purple. Every second, more of his life drained away. Still, none of them stopped. They crossed a hundred yards, then two hundred. All of them were struck glancing blows by the storm, but their luck held, perhaps literally. Until it didn’t.

Yoshi was struck in the chest by a lightning bolt and went down. The storm had reached the enhanced rank, and a large black scorch mark could be seen between his pecs. Another spot of blackened char was on the bottom of his foot where the electricity had exited his body. The adept went down, and smoke rose from his body in slow dark curls. Richter and Sion gritted their teeth and kept going.

Sion went down next. A basketball-sized stone fell from the sky and struck his shoulder. His gaseous form removed a third of the damage, but the blow took a horrible toll. A spray of red blood and a sickening crunch were his first indications that he had taken a hit. Then waves of nauseating pain spread through his body and his vision darkened. Sion tried to get back up, but the poison had evolved along with the size of the rocks once the spell reached the enhanced rank. Prompts appeared on the sprite’s interface.

You have been Mangled. Complete loss of control of your right arm.

You are Bleeding. You will lose 7 health per second for the next 2 minutes and 18 seconds or until bleeding is stopped.

You are being actively Poisoned. You will lose 16 points of health per second. Remove yourself from the poisoned area to start the countdown of losing this status.

You are Weakened. You have lost 60% of your total stamina and will continue to lose 5% every 20 seconds until you lose your Poisoned status.

It was all Sion could do to roll out of the poisoned impact crater. Even that was an epic struggle as his health drained away at twenty-three points every second. When he was clear, he downed Cure Poison and Restore Health potions from his belt pouch. That was all he could manage before he swooned and knew only blackness.

Richter’s heart tore in half as he saw his best friend in any world go down, but he kept running. He had come to understand that his life was not his own, and he would be damned if he let his people down. The chaos seed’s eyes were glued to the shiny red beacon floating over the goblin’s head. He ran faster and suddenly, against all odds, he was through!

The possessed Druid loomed ahead, and the earth continued to shake due to the maelstrom behind him. Richter’s eyes narrowed in hatred at the being that had most likely killed his Companion. With a quick movement, he drew his elementum sword from the sheath on his back. His one hope was that he could kill the powerful being before it noticed him.

Both of the goblin’s eyes were closed as he focused upon building the spell. If the chaos seed could just get close enough, Richter could plunge his blade into the caster’s heart and finally end this battle. Fighting back a cry of fury, Richter continued to sprint silently. He was only twenty feet away when the goblin’s red jeweled eyes opened. Then the Druid smiled and Richter’s world dissolved into pain.

<<You would challenge me?>> It asked. Richter immediately knew he was not being addressed by a flesh and blood creature, but by a far more powerful entity. Its voice was old and deep. The words vibrated the air and seemed to come from many directions at once. Its voice was that of a being that had lived through countless lives and only found joy when they were extinguished. Richter had thought its tone might be mocking, but apparently, he was not important enough to be mocked. No. The Bloodstone was amused.

The possessed Druid had made no external motion, but its red stone eyes had flashed. Richter didn’t know it, but the stone had used one of its primary powers to link to the blood of nearby beings. The mind-shattering pain he felt was his body reacting to the fact that the flow of blood through his body slowed. Every one of his cells began to die, and Richter experienced simultaneous failure of his organs all at once. His health plummeted. The chaos seed fell to his knees with a strangled cry as the goblin continued to smile.

<<You quickly learn your place. This is good.>> The Bloodstone closed its eyes once more to focus on pouring mana into its spell. Richter remained in obeisance to a power that was beyond him. Sion struggled to breathe, and Yoshi lay still while deadly power rained around them. Through it all, one small heart beat wildly, filled with hope and fury.

The storm continued to build. It reached the trees, and those left living retreated back from the now potent rank spell. The elemental attacks were falling so quickly that they struck the ground in a steady rhythm. The sprites had picked up the bodies of the Hearth Mother and the other mages. They shielded them with their own bodies, but despite the tree cover, they all knew death would come soon. All would have been lost, except for the savage love of one small dragonling.

Silent as a swooping hawk, Alma dove. It had taken her longer than she would have wished to fly around the periphery of the magical storm, but she could still move much faster than her master. When she had seen Richter on his knees and saw his life falling, the dragonling felt a pain in her breast that she had never known before. The expansion of her consciousness was wonderful in so many ways, but of late, she had wondered if it also made her vulnerable. She loved her master more than she would have ever thought possible, and her dependence on him had made her uncomfortable over the past weeks. Alma had never shared her concerns, but they had been occupying her mind more and more. As she flew closer to her target, however, she learned that love was not only a weakness, it was also a strength. The dragonling pushed her body further and faster than ever before. It only took a few more seconds to circle behind the Druid. Then, with clear purpose, she attacked.





CHAPTER 43 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG




Alma knew that a frontal assault was useless. Her master had been brave to try, but also foolish. He had a blend of courage and stupidity that she found endearing but also insanely irritating. Once again, it fell to her to save her silly master. So she would.

The dragonling dove at her top speed, and unleashed her Psi Blast when she was only meters away. In its tightest beam, it bathed the goblin in psychic energy. Her Mental Deep Magic assaulted the Blood Deep Magic of the stone. There was no way that she could match the power of the ancient artifact, but the flesh it inhabited was much weaker.

The goblin reared back, barely keeping control of the spell. It resisted the secondary effects of Stun and Disorientation, but Alma’s attack weakened the hold the Bloodstone had on the Druid by the slightest amount. Radg-or had not been completely destroyed when the possession began, merely forced into an impossibly dark space.

When the goblin had actually felt the cold will of the Bloodstone, the Druid had been horrified to his very core. He had delighted in the pain of others in the past, but had never imagined the dispassionate “nothingness” of the stone’s will. Even more horrifying, he had learned its true purpose. Though Radg-or’s mind and spirit were weak as newborn kittens, he began to fight back.

Before the stone could even react to the goblin’s defiance, Alma carried out the rest of her attack. With all four claws extended, she slammed into the back of the goblin’s neck. Her new psi poison injected into his body. A moment later, she snaked her head around to his throat and bit down hard. An arterial spray of black blood filled her mouth and covered her face. The taste was disgusting, but it was worth it. Her venom entered the vessel that supplied blood to the goblin’s brain, further disrupting the stone’s hold.

Finally, her venom spent, she firmed her grip on the goblin and attacked with Brain Drain. As her own consciousness was carried away by the mental flood of the goblin’s thoughts and experiences, she sent one last message, *I love you, master.* Then she lost all sense of self while being swept away by the flood of the Druid’s memories… and something more.

Richter fell forward onto all fours, panting. His blood flow had only been inhibited for a few seconds, but he had lost hundreds of health. The chaos seed might have lost consciousness as soon as the Bloodstone’s power released him, but he heard Alma’s voice and looked up. The goblin’s face was twisted by indignant rage at his familiar’s attack. The chaos seed watched as the possessed Druid reached up for his helpless dragonling and a roar rose out of Richter’s battered form.

“Nooooo!”

Richter raised his arm quickly and threw his short sword underhand. The attack was not strong, but the moonstone blade easily pierced the goblin’s robes. The Bloodstone turned its attention back to Richter, intending to halt the flow of his blood again, but Richter was already moving. In one sure motion, he drew his second short sword and stabbed it through the Druid’s heart.

Between the psychic attacks, the trauma of Richter’s blades and the Radg-or’s renewed consciousness, the Bloodstone lost a modicum of control. That was all it took. As Richter stared into the goblin’s face, their noses only inches apart, the Druid’s eyes became mortal again. As strange as that was, the look of gratitude in the goblin’s eyes was even more shocking. They stared at one another for long moment, bitter enemies now united in purpose. With black blood covering his teeth and lips, Radg-or simply said, “Thank you.”

Then the Druid used this one chance to die on his own terms. Taking control of the spell, he purposefully triggered a spell backlash. The maelstrom stopped sending down elemental attacks, and the air grew heavy with bottled energy. Every soul in the valley felt the importance of that one moment in time, and knew instinctually that all of their fates were about to be decided.

The moment ended and the Druid’s head flung back. Both of arms flung out to the sides as the thousands of points of mana in the storm flooded back into his body all at once. Radg-or could not even scream as every neuron in his body was burned out simultaneously. He died before his mind could even register the pain. The energy from the spell could not be contained by the goblin’s ruined body though. The veins in his skin began pulsing with red light, faster and brighter.

Richter stood there, one hand on the hilt of his elementum short sword still sticking out of the goblin’s corpse. He had been both shocked and relieved when the Druid’s body slumped in death. Seeing the vessels in the goblins body begin to pulse though, his heart started beating wildly with premonition and panic. Alma was slowly opening her eyes as she finished feasting, but not fast enough.

With a strength fueled by dread, Richter pulled his blades from the goblin’s body and swung clear through Radg-or’s neck. Then, grabbing both the head and the dragonling attached to it like a football, he started sprinting away from the body that was now glowing like a volcano before eruption. He had only made it seven steps before the body exploded with uncontained power. The explosion threw him forward off his feet. Richter had a last view of a rock growing large in his vision, then there was only pain. Then, there was only the black.





CHAPTER 44 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





A rough tongue licked Richter’s face. He blinked in confusion then sat up groaning. His health bar flashed, dangerously low. The chaos seed raised one hand to his head. There was something hard embedded in his skull. When he pulled it out, a small amount of blood started flowing. He looked at what he held in confusion until he realized it was a yellowed, goblin tooth. A golden glow out of his field of view made him look left. Alma was casting a spell, and his meager health bar began to refill. The pain ebbed slightly. The chaos seed dropped the tooth and quickly checked his status page. Thankfully, he wasn’t injured enough to have any debuffs.

Relieved that he had avoided a skull fracture or something even worse, he sent Alma to check on Sion and Yoshi and offer healing if necessary. After drinking two health potions, Richter stood up slowly and looked around. It seemed like only a short time had passed, and all of his forces remained in the tree line. They were venturing forward now that the maelstrom was fading away, though. The dark clouds were clearing, and blue sky could be seen peeking through. Richter was eager to check on his comrades, but with the allied forces coming forward, he knew that Sion and Yoshi would have magical attention soon. Though the battle was done, there was still danger. He turned his attention to the remains of the Druid, or lack thereof.

All that remained of the space where Radg-or had been standing was a crater, three feet deep. On the ground surrounding the ragged depression were small chunks of meat and spatters of black blood. Richter was fairly certain that his back was covered with the same. When the goblin had blown, he’d blown big.

None of this mattered, though. Nothing mattered except for the craggy red orb sitting at the bottom of the crater. For a few moments, all Richter could do was stare at it. It was only the size of a crystal ball back on Earth. He could have held it in the palm of his hand. No larger than one of those hackneyed props you saw in low budget movies. It wasn’t shining now, but just lay there on the ground, dark and inert. His identification Talent showed him its properties, and Richter saw the gold prompt of a relic for the first time.

You have found:

Bloodstone

Durability: 780,000/780,000

Item Class: Relic

Quality: God Crafted

Weight: 5.2 kg

Traits: A Bloodstone is a relic from before the banishing of the gods. Some have said it is only a repository of magic. Others have said that it one of the purest expressions of evil in The Land. Still more say that the intentions of the stone itself are only a reflection of its user. Much is unknown about the Bloodstones, but it is known that spilling the lifeblood of living beings upon the stone increases its power. Be wary of using the power of a Bloodstone. They are harbingers of both change and death.





Richter shook his head. The durability on the thing was, well ungodly! He realized that based on the description, maybe he had it backwards. “God Crafted” or not, he wasn’t about to believe the part about it not being evil. He had heard its voice. Even if it wasn’t evil, it sure as shit wasn’t friendly.

The chaos seed was wary of touching it directly, so he took a cloth sack out of his Bag of Holding. It held some dried vegetables that he emptied out onto the ground. Then, with the opening of the sack wide, he scooped the stone up. For a moment, he thought he heard something, but when Richter listened, the sound didn’t repeat itself. He contemplated putting the sack back into his Bag of Holding, but somehow it seemed like a bad idea to put a godly item into the pocket dimension that held his most precious possessions. The chaos seed couldn’t say exactly why it seemed like a shit idea, except that it was so obviously a shit idea. Instead, he tied it to his belt and ran as quickly as his damaged body allowed him to check on his comrades.

Thankfully, Sion was already on his feet. His skin looked slightly green, but when Richter used Analyze he saw that his friend’s health was climbing. Richter ran over to Yoshi and was relieved to see that the adept was still alive, though unconscious. He cast Minor Slow Heal and watched for a moment. It might have just been his imagination, but he thought the half-sprite’s breathing eased slightly. More healers rushed up, and Richter left Yoshi in their care.

Richter looked out at the battlefield and shook his head at the devastation. What had been a field of beautiful grass had become a wasteland. Blood had mixed with dirt to make a thick, muddy slurry. All around the field were signs of the elemental attacks. Deep craters, scorch marks, flash frozen mud, and even two stalks of fulgurite dotted the landscape. He would be surprised if anything grew here for years. There was more to occupy his attention than the topography, though. A contingent of his guards were walking forward with two of the trolls, led by Terrod, Caulder, and Damien. Both mercenaries were unarmed.

“We greet you,” one said in perfect common-speak.

“What is your name?” the other asked arrogantly.

Terrod spoke up, anger in his voice, “Watch your tongue. You are addressing-”

Richter held up a hand, stopping him. He wasn’t sure what was about to happen, but he was sure that this was a negotiation. That meant knowledge was power. “My name is not important right now. What is important is that you give me a reason to not slaughter you and all of your men,” his tone was weary as if he couldn’t care either way. In truth, he didn’t. Richter quickly used Analyze and found their names were Vulzal and Ttarmok. Ttarmok was the one who had asked his name.

“We are only hired soldiers,” Vulzal said sternly. He clearly didn’t like how Richter had spoken to him. “We have also surrendered.”

“The forms of battle require you to-” Ttarmok said

“Fuck your rules!” Richter screamed. Spittle flew from his lips, so great was his rage. He didn’t know it, but both of his blades had found their way into this hands. He took a step forward, red tingeing the corners of his vision. His emotions were surging. As was often the case, he was able to compartmentalize when there was something difficult to be done, fighting a battle for instance. Afterwards, the emotions came rushing in all at once, and for a short time he could lose control. That was the time he became truly dangerous. That was when his demon could awaken.

These… men, if you could call them that, had killed his people and now they were standing in front of him speaking about the forms of battle? Richter felt like he was losing his grip on sanity. These disgusting trolls had participated in the imprisonment, murder, and rape of hundreds of people and had almost unleashed an ancient horror upon his village. Richter blinked, realizing that he was shaking. Both swords vibrated in his grasp.

He took a long slow breath. When he focused on the trolls again, he saw that the calm visage on both of their faces was gone. Vulzal looked guarded, and Ttarmok’s eyes had widened in fear. Even Richter’s own guards seemed ill at ease after witnessing the fury of their lord. Both Caulder and Terrod had their hands on the hilts of their weapons. Uneasy or not, they would follow their leader’s command.

The chaos seed took another deep breath and found some control. In a strained, but measured voice, he spoke again, “Choose your next words wisely. Tell me why you should live. Speak carefully, or I swear to any gods that may be listening, I will personally butcher you all.”

Ttarmok swallowed hard, and his waxy green skin blanched. It was Vulzal that answered, “On behalf of the Shattered Bone Troll clan, I formally absolve any of the forces here today from blood debt. Further, I extend to you the token of my clan. It entitles you to one audience with our leaders. It is true that I cannot stop you from killing me and my soldiers, but this is only one battle. After the enemy you have made today, you may be happy to count me a friend in the future.”

With that ominous pronouncement, the troll slowly reached into a small pouch at his waist. Caulder raised his mace threateningly, but Vulzal raised an answering hand in peace. Then, moving even slower, Vulzal pulled out a coin-sized disc that had been carved from blackened bone. Richter’s identification Talent triggered.

You have received:

Token of the Shattered Bone Troll Clan

Durability: 54/54

Item Class: Uncommon

Quality: Well Crafted

Weight: 0.2 kg

Traits: This token will give you safe passage through the lands of the Shattered Bone clan. The bearer of this token will be taken safely to the leaders of the clan. The protection will not extend further than that. It has been enchanted with a magical signature that cannot be replicated.





Richter looked back up at the trolls, not speaking. No one moved for more than a minute. Ttarmok’s face twitched, but he kept his silence. The chaos seed finally said, “More.”

Vulzal wanted to smile, but kept it from his face. He was finally back in familiar territory. Now it was all about negotiating. Over almost a century of battle, it was not the first time he had been on the losing side of a battle and had needed to use words, not blades, to ensure his survival. “Of course, my lord. I am also happy to give you a warning. The commander, Heqht-jo, sent for reinforcements before he attacked. I believe it would take some time for them to arrive, but that was more than an hour ago. I hope that this serves as proof that we are not your enemies. We merely happened to be on the wrong side of this unfortunate conflict.”

Richter’s jaw tightened again at hearing the words “unfortunate conflict,” but Caulder spoke up before his lord could respond, “And your life price?”

Both Vulzal and Ttarmok bowed slightly. “Of course,” Vulzal said when he straightened. “We will pay extra to be allowed to leave with our arms and armor, and relinquish the possessions of our dead. If you will agree to let us take their bodies with us, we will pay the death price as well.”

Sion had walked up during the conversation. His voice was weak, and one shoulder was slumped, but at least he was on his feet. “Life price?” he asked.

It was Caulder who answered, “This isn’t the first time I’ve had to fight mercenaries. They are scum who will betray their employers at the first chance.” Both trolls scowled but did not interrupt. “If captured, they pay a price for each of their soldiers that are allowed to leave the field. A death price is paid to take the bodies of their dead with them so that they can be properly buried. Most mercenaries would not even think to waste hard coin on such things.” The sergeant gazed at both trolls for a moment before begrudgingly adding, “It speaks well for them, my lord, that they care about their fallen.”

Richter listened to all of this silently. When Caulder was done, he turned to Damien, “And what does my ally say? I would value your counsel. If you do not wish them to leave, then they won’t. Either way, this battle will end now.”

Trolls, humans, and sprites alike all looked at Yoshi’s second in command. Damien was completely overwhelmed. The sprite Warrior was more than comfortable making battle decisions, but affairs of state were beyond him. The sprite opened his mouth to speak, then closed it without uttering a word. Ultimately, he just bowed his head towards Richter and said, “I will bow to your wisdom and support your decision.” All eyes turned towards the chaos seed.

Richter stared stonily at the trolls. Vulzal still had the token in his hand. The chaos seed’s grip tightened on the hilts of both of his weapons as he considered the trolls’ fates. Ttarmok swallowed visibly, but Vulzal just returned his gaze steadily, ready for anything that might happen.

With a quick move, Richter slammed both blades back into the sheaths on his back. “I imagine there is a standard life and death price?” he asked his sergeant.

Caulder nodded, and Ttarmok spoke up, “Yes, lord. We will happily pay-”

“Double,” Richter interrupted. Ttarmok opened his mouth again, but Richter just firmly repeated, “Double. You will also pay the equivalent price for any armors and armor you wish to take with you. I will take your token and may one day call upon your people. Finally, you will tell us everything you know about the goblins and why they were here.”

Ttarmok seemed like he still wanted to argue. Greed overwhelmed the troll’s earlier fear. Luckily for him, Vulzal was smart enough to realize how narrowly they had just avoided death. The troll bowed and said, “It will be as you say, but I must be able to tell my superiors who has shown us such generosity. I recognize the wood sprites of Nadria and can guess that only the fabled Hearth Mother could have resisted the power of the Bloodstone. You, and your forces, however, are a mystery to me.”

He stared at the troll sergeant while Alma hovered behind him and said, “I am Richter of the Mist Village, and these lands are under my protection.”





CHAPTER 45 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





As soon as Richter took the troll’s token, prompts appeared.

Congratulations! The relationship of the Mist Village with the trolls of the Shattered Bone Clan has improved from Distaste to Apathetic.

The Mist Village has received 50 (base +100) Diplomacy Points in regards to the Shattered Bone Clan.

Lack of a Town Hallcauses complete loss of any gained Diplomacy Points. Current Diplomacy Points (Mist Village→ Shattered Bone Clan):0

Richter gritted his teeth. Once again, he had lost diplomacy points because his village wasn’t developed enough. It seemed like, time and again, The Land was telling him that he was punching above his weight. Well, fuck that! He was still standing. It just meant he needed to bulk up faster.

There were more prompts waiting to be addressed, but Richter needed the information that the trolls had to give. Vulzal quickly outlined everything he knew. The goblins, who all belonged to the Ash Stalker clan, had been taking advantage of a recent decrease in the power of the kobold clans. The goblins didn’t know why certain kobold outposts had been abandoned, but they were expanding their own underground territory while the kobolds were distracted. In doing so, they had discovered the eastern entrance to the hidden valley.

Even this small amount of information caused a reaction among the allies. As soon as the troll said “Ash Stalker,” both Sion and Damien cursed. Richter looked at his Companion in askance, and his friend had just bleakly looked back and said, “They’re big.” The chaos seed frowned slightly and motioned for Vulzal to continue.

Apparently, as large as the goblin clan was, they had still run into issues of their own, underground. The troll didn’t know what had happened, but the goblins’ forces had suddenly been stretched thin. That was why the trolls had been hired. Vulzal knew that the goblins had found something important in the cave in the center of the encampment, but again could not clarify what. He just knew that because the goblin clan was fighting on multiple fronts, they had needed the mercenaries to fortify this position. The mercs had only arrived in the past few days and had just been sitting idly until the allied forces had attacked.

Sion pressed the trolls for any indication of what the goblins had found, but both continually denied any specific knowledge. The goblins had apparently been extremely clear that the trolls were to go nowhere near the central cave. They hadn’t even been allowed inside the central barbican. Richter was disappointed by the lack of info, but Vulzal had two more things to add that changed everything.

The troll told them that the goblins had been charging the Bloodstone because they needed a massive amount of spell power for whatever they had found in the cave. Again, he didn’t know what exactly the goblins had been planning, but Vulzal had heard one of them mention a “shield” at one point. What made Richter stop walking and grab his sword hilt again, though, was when Vulzal said there were more prisoners.

“What?” Richter shouted. The image of what that young boy and those poor men and women had to endure flashed through his head again. For a moment, he was willing to throw away his agreement with the trolls just to unleash his anger. Sion put a hand on his arm, though. Richter whipped his head around, looking for an outlet. When he saw his friend still suffering from the effects of the poison, though, his ardor to renew the battle waned. “Where are they?” he asked the troll through gritted teeth. “Where are the prisoners?”

Vulzal hadn’t missed what had just happened, and he had taken a half step back. In a calming voice, as if speaking to a growling animal, the troll said, “The goblins kept them down in the cave as labor of some sort. None of my people had anything to do with the prisoners, above or below ground.”

Richter’s nostrils flared, but he maintained control of himself. All of them had been walking towards encampment as they spoke. Most of the allied forces had left the valley to start the trip back to the village. The prisoners still needed to be taken to safety, and even before the troll’s warning about reinforcements, it had always been the plan to get back to the safety of the mists as soon as possible.

The chaos seed’s mind raced. The goblins had been destroyed, the Bloodstone had been captured, and the prisoners had been freed, or so he had thought. That had left only one objective, to steal or destroy whatever had brought the goblins to the valley. Richter had purposefully kept the last foxfire crystals in reserve in case they were needed to burn whatever they found. He had added a fifth objective now, that being the life and death price the trolls had agreed to pay, and by extension, robbing the encampment blind. The loot should help his village greatly, even if he did have to split it with his allies. The trolls’ gold was in a lockbox back at the encampment.

All of that meant the force moving towards the encampment was only comprised of Richter, Sion, Damien, Caulder, Terrod, twenty other fighters, guards, and meidon sprites. The idea was that the small strike squad could make it to the encampment, do what needed to be done, and leave quickly. With the news that goblin reinforcements were on the way, it had become even more important for the bulk of the army to get out of the valley and back to the safety of the forest. This was especially true as they would be slowed down by needing to aid the wounded and carry the dead.

The bulk of the troll mercenaries had left as well, walking in front of the allied forces. Only Ttarmok and Vulzal were left in the valley. After Richter and the trolls had reached an agreement, the chaos seed had demanded the enemy force leave. Once the mercs left the ravine, they would head east towards their home in the Azergoth Swamp, leaving the troll sergeants to catch up later. It was true that having the trolls leave armed was a risk, but hundreds of sprites would be watching them, arrows nocked. Regeneration abilities or not, the trolls wouldn’t survive an imbued volley from so many.

The chaos seed walked in silence for a moment while he digested what he had been told. As they got closer to the camp, he asked, “Are there more guards down in the tunnels?”

The troll shrugged, “Normally, there are. I don’t know if Heqht-jo emptied the mines before coming to battle, but even if he didn’t, there are normally only a handful of goblins to watch the slaves.”

Richter nodded, and the inklings of a plan started to form in his mind. Looking at Vulzal again, he asked, “How much to employ you for ten minutes?”

The grin that came over the troll’s face made his visage truly ghastly.





CHAPTER 46 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





“They are coming!” Vulzal shouted at the top of his lungs. His goblin-speak was not as fluent as his common, but it should be more than up to the task. He ran down into the cave with Ttarmok in tow. The troll had his blade out, and it was smeared with dark red blood.

“Who is that?” A goblin grinder looked around a bend in the tunnel. “You are not supposed to be down here.” The guard hefted his crossbow while he stared at trolls suspiciously.

“And what does it tell you that we are?” Ttarmok said aggressively. “The enemy forces outnumbered us, and we had to retreat back to the inner wall! Heqht-jo wants everyone up to man the walls and fight back the attackers.” The troll may have quailed slightly when faced with the murderous human, but he was in no way intimidated by a mere goblin.

“Why aren’t one of our people down here?” the goblin asked, still suspicious. The trolls had kept walking, though, and he hadn’t fired, so their deception was at least partially effective.

Vulzal shook his head in distaste, “Many of your people were slaughtered by sprites. Even my men took serious losses. We don’t have any more time.” He held up his bloody blade. “There is more sprite blood to spill. Your commander wants all ten of you up top. Now!” The trolls stopped right next to the grinder. Two other goblin scouts had walked up.

The goblin lowered his crossbow and looked at Vulzal in confusion, “What do you mean ten? All of the other guards were already taken for the battle. We are the only ones left.”

Ttarmok sighed, “That should not have been that easy. They really do breed you goblins dumb, don’t they?”

The grinder was about to respond angrily to the insult but found it very hard to speak with Vulzal’s blade through his throat. The two trolls had fought together long enough that Ttarmok had distracted the grinder without even having to be asked. The dead goblin slid to the ground as Vulzal withdrew his blade. Then the trolls started advancing on the goblin scouts that looked at them, wide-eyed in fear.

As they stalked the scouts, Vulzal thought about the enemy commander. The dark-skinned human’s plan to kill the last remaining goblins inside the encampment had been simple, but effective. Vulzal had been especially impressed when Richter suggested stabbing a dead human body to put blood on their swords and make the deception more realistic. It was exactly the kind of cold and brutal logic that trolls valued. One of the sprites had predictably objected, but Richter had just asked if the remains of the dead were more important than the lives of the living. After that, there had been no more dissent.

Vulzal swung his blade at a scout, easily powering through the small goblin’s defense. The blow wasn’t meant to kill so much as wound. The troll had never liked goblins and causing the scout pain was improving his mood. He stabbed the small green creature again, enjoying its squeals, and reflected that Richter was indeed a human he could work with.





CHAPTER 47 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The trolls came out of the cave a few minutes later. Richter was in the process of recharging his enchanted weapons with weak and poor soul stones.

“The goblins are dead,” Vulzal said simply.

“And the prisoners?” Richter asked.

“Further down in the cave. I thought you’d want to check on them yourself.” The troll waved a hand near his face. “If they saw me coming out of the dark, they might shit themselves to death,” he said with a chuckle.

Neither Richter nor any of his comrades joined in the laughter, but the chaos seed did reach into his bag. He pulled out two silver pieces and tossed one to each troll. Ttarmok looked at him curiously, “I did not expect you to actually pay us for killing the goblins. You know that we would have done that just to preserve our own lives.”

“I always pay my debts,” Richter said quietly, keeping eye contact. “In every sense of the word. Remember that.”

“We will not be forgetting you, Lord Richter,” promised Vulzal. There was something in his voice that Richter could not quite place. The chaos seed asked a few more questions, then he dismissed the trolls, both from his presence and his consideration. He couldn’t stomach being around his former enemies any longer. They may have just been hired hands, but they had also killed his people. He would not be forgetting that, and he would most certainly not forgive.

“Sion. Terrod. You’re with me,” Richter said. “Caulder, take the trolls over to their strongbox and get what we are owed and nothing more. I trust your judgement. This is not a negotiation, however. If they give you any trouble, take their heads.” He didn’t bother looking at the mercenaries as he said it. “Once they pay, cut them loose, but without their weapons. I won’t have them coming up behind our people armed. I want you to take half the men with you. The rest of you, sweep the encampment in teams of five. If there are any more goblins or prisoners hidden here, I want to know. Kill the former, save the latter, no exceptions.”

Everyone clapped a fist to their hearts and said, “Yes, milord.” Ttarmok looked bothered by what Richter said, but Vulzal just smiled slightly. Sharp teeth poked past the troll’s lips, but not as a threat. The troll sergeant just nodded in respect towards the chaos seed and walked off.

Richter looked at Alma, *Fly high, my love. If the trolls are right, the goblin forces will be coming from the entrance at the end of the valley. Watch the whole valley and let me know what you see.*

*Are you sure you’re feeling better?* she asked him. Concern was evident in her tone, and she sent him a mental image of when he had been kneeling in front of the Druid, choking on his own blood.

*I’m fine,* he snapped back with irritation. *And please god never show me that again!* Living through it had been terrible enough, he didn’t need the replay! He took a breath and realized that she deserved better than that, *I’m sorry, love. I will be fine. I still haven’t thanked you for saving me. Thank you. I would be lost without your love and support. I need you flying reconnaissance, though. I’m sure whatever might be down there is something I can handle. Besides, I have Sion, Terrod and the adder as backup. Please be my eyes in the sky.*

Alma sent her assent. She flew close and licked his cheek, bringing a slight chuckle to his grim face. Finally feeling better, she flew up to keep watch on the valley. Richter looked at his Companions and said, “Let’s go.”

The three men walked down into the cave. The trolls had said it took a few minutes to get to where they had seen the goblins, so Richter dealt with some of the sea of notifications waiting for him. He chose to address the ones dealing with Alma first.

You have been awarded 52,972 experience (base 605,398 x 0.07 x 1.25) from Brain Drain against Level 27 goblin Druid, Radg-or; Station: Rikker.

Congratulations! Your familiar has reached level 38!

It was great seeing how his familiar was advancing, but the next prompt almost brought a tear to his eye. He had no idea how much he had missed that sweet sound.

TRING!

Talent Points Remaining: 61 Talent Points.

Even after living through the horrors of the battle, and suffering the pain of the Bloodstone’s spell, Richter felt a thrill. He had progressed! The chaos seed couldn’t wait to invest his new Characteristic points. This was also the first time he had leveled since obtaining his Essence Specialization. Getting the extra ten Talent points to go along with the ones he had gotten before was amazing.

Richter dismissed the prompt dealing with his Talent points, but couldn’t wait to invest his new stat points. He pulled up his abbreviated status page.

Richter glanced through his page, but it was just an indulgence. The main reason was that he had wanted to see his new level. He already knew where his points were going to go. The chaos seed invested five points into Intelligence, and keeping with his esoteric personality, one point went into Luck. As always, he wondered if he had actually gotten smarter after investing in Intelligence. The stat wasn’t the same thing as intellect, but increasing his Intelligence was supposed to have a marginal effect on his brainpower as well as deepening his mana well. Of course, he couldn’t tell.

He invested the 25% skill bonus into Enchanting without a second thought. Gone were the days of his playing fast and loose with the perk. When all of his skills were low level, it hadn’t really made a difference which he invested in. It had seemed like he leveled a different skill every day. Now that he was advancing higher, though, skill progression was harder to come by, even with his Limitless ability. The bonus finally got him a specific prompt for the first time in a month.

Congratulations! You have reached skill level 47 in Enchanting. All enchantments 1% more effective and increased chance of enchantments taking hold.

Receiving the notification was more than satisfying. After closing his status screen, part of him did want to open his Profession page up, but by then, he could see firelight dancing against the tunnel wall. They had gotten to the bend. The trolls had said that was where the bodies of the goblins were. Once they turned the corner, the sight of three mutilated bodies greeted them.

Terrod cursed. The trolls had not been kind. One body had black smears on the ground, showing where the scout had tried to crawl away. The trolls had not taken long, but they had extracted as much pain as they could in the time allotted. Richter just looked at the scene dispassionately, taking it for what it was. A message… and maybe an advertisement.

They were standing in a small cave, the ceiling only ten feet high. The tunnel continued at a downward angle on the other side of the cavern. Richter took point. He had a small magical light floating near his head, but it couldn’t penetrate the shadowed depths of the tunnel. The chaos seed cast Far Light and a ball of white light shot away from his fingers. It stuck to the floor of the tunnel where it leveled out again. He didn’t see anything but more tunnel. Nodding to his Companions, he started walking.

All three of them had their weapons out the shale adder slid along the ground beside them. Richter kept his eye out for traps, but nothing lit up red. Soon they were at the bottom of the ramp. They kept following the tunnel. The walls were rough-hewn grey rock, and pebbles were scattered across the ground. Not everything he saw was benign though. Along one stretch of the cave wall was a smear of dried blood. An awful scent had started to build as well, worsening the deeper they went.

Soon the tunnel opened into another cavern, this one much larger. It stretched forty feet high and countless thin stalactites hung from the ceiling. The shape of this part of the cave system was more like a hallway, with the sides sloped almost straight up. The cavern was about twenty yards across, but very deep. The far end was lost in shadow. Richter cast Far Light several times. What he saw made his heart seize in his chest.

Figures lay on the ground like forgotten trash. As he cast the spell again and again, he saw more bodies in various stages of decomposition. The Companions now knew where the horrible stench was coming from. Some had wounds, some broken bones and more than a few had their heads stove-in. Richter’s blood pressure began to rise. The trolls were definitely lucky they were no longer near him.

More balls of light flew from his hands, showing more than a hundred bodies, until the spheres stuck to the bars of a cage. Hundreds of eyes weakly reflected the faint light. Men, women and children were pressing themselves against the far side of their cage. Terror was etched onto all of their faces as they wondered what new horrors their goblin captors would inflict. Richter kept casting Far Light and five more cages were revealed. The bodies of both the living and the dead were inside them.

Richter ran up to one cage, and the people began wailing in fear. He skidded to a halt, “Good people! My name is Lord Richter, and I am here to free you. All of the goblins have been killed. I will get you out!”

The wailing did not abate for some reason. Then Richter realized that he had run at all of them with his blade out. To make matters worse, he was splattered with blood, mud and small specks of flesh. He might as well be a monster as far as the abused slaves were concerned. Luckily, Sion came to the rescue.

“Lord Richter speaks the truth! I am a sprite of the Nadrian forest. You know I would not be standing here if your oppressors had not been slain.” Sion’s voice was pained, and he still favored his shoulder. His tone was also calm, though. “I cannot even imagine what you have had to endure, but Lord Richter has killed the goblins that have been tormenting you. I am sure you are scared, but we do not have much time. More goblins are coming. We are going to open the cages. Those of you with strength, please help those who are too weak to walk. Lord Richter will see you to safety, but we must move quickly.”

As the sprite was speaking, the cries of fear fell silent. The slaves just stared now, but it was still a marked improvement. Luckily, the padlocks were only simple iron. Richter could have picked them, but smashing them with the pommel of his short sword was easier. The chaos seed wrenched each door open. He retrieved every remaining health and stamina potion from his Bag and handed them to his Companions. Then Richter moved on to the next lock. Sion and Terrod ushered the prisoners out, distributing the potions as needed. It wasn’t until the last cage was opened that one of the prisoners spoke to him.

A human woman stepped towards him. She had Asian features and olive skin. He guessed that her hair would have been blond it hadn’t been so dirty and matted. She wasn’t wearing clothes so much as rags, and bruises dotted her body. One eye was swollen shut. Despite all that, Richter could see that at her core she was a beauty. Her chest was small, but it tapered to ample hips, and her features were fine. He could only imagine what she had suffered at the hands of the goblins. It made the fact that she still had a fierce gaze even more shocking and impressive.

“You are Lord Richter?” she asked in common-speak. Her tone was sure. It contrasted completely with the broken appearance of most of the other prisoners.

“I am,” he replied.

She bowed her head, “I imagine that you did not come here merely to free us. Still I thank you from the depths of my heart, and will do whatever I can to repay this debt.”

“You’re right,” Richter said. “You do not need to worry about any of that now, though. This isn’t a trick. Just go with the others.”

“No,” she said firmly. She stepped in his way as he tried to walk past. “I am honor bound to repay this debt to you.”

Richter blinked in confusion. Who was this woman? Who would voluntarily stay in these caves after having been used for slave labor? He used Analyze and found that her name was Enalise. He also found out much more.

She was the first person he had ever met with two Professions! Richter took another look at her. He had initially been distracted by both his anger at her treatment and her beauty. There was probably a lesson in that, but he was too busy reassessing her to really pay attention to such a trivial matter. Now that he was paying more attention, he could see that her arms were extremely well toned. She didn’t have the giant muscles of a warrior, but her biceps, triceps and deltoids were well-defined. Enalise just returned his gaze as he studied her.

Richter came to a decision. There was probably much more that he didn’t know about the strong-willed woman, but she was willing to help. He couldn’t afford to waste time wandering around in dark. “I’ll accept your offer, but only if you let me heal you first.”

Her face became somewhat guarded, but she still nodded with almost no hesitation. Richter raised one hand and cast his spells in quick succession. Weak Slow Heal, Weak Cure Disease, and Weak Cure Poison. He finished with a fifth casting, Weak Detect Hostile Intent. The chaos seed had fallen for the damsel in distress act once before. The consequence of that mistake still literally gave him nightmares that made him wake up drenched in sweat. He was relieved when Enalise did not start glowing red in response to his last spell. His breath caught, though when the sac tied to his waist started to shine a sinister scarlet.

Richter stared at the large pouch holding the Bloodstone for long seconds, until Sion walked up behind them and touched his arm. The chaos seed started but came back to himself. Putting the relic out of his mind, at least for the moment, he focused on finishing the mission. Reaching into his Bag of Holding, he pulled a shirt out and handed it to the Miner.

“If you’re going to come with me, I can’t have you walking around in naught but your skin,” he said. She took the shirt and after slipping it on, she tied her old rags around her waist like a belt. “I just wish I had some boots for you.”

“Do not worry, Lord Richter. I have been walking around in these sandals for months.”

“Months!” Sion exclaimed. “Have the goblins truly been here so long?”

“No,” she said bitterly. “They brought me here from another settlement.” The three of them started walking quickly towards the back of the cavern. The shale adder slid behind them, unseen and unheard, only a few feet from Enalise. Richter didn’t think he had anything to fear from the woman, but despite his feeling and his spell, he wasn’t taking any chances. After all, his Detect Hostile Intent spell was only of the weak rank. He was sure it wasn’t infallible. Blissfully unaware of the predator following her, Enalise told her short but tragic tale.

She and three friends had been exploring a cave system in the Serrated Mountains late last year. They had been snowed in, but it wasn’t anything they hadn’t planned for. She came from Rione, the kingdom north of the mountains, and it wasn’t uncommon for mining teams to be gone for an entire winter. There were even underground outposts made specifically for the purpose of supplying such teams and also for mutual defense.

Enalise had been asleep when the goblins attacked. They usually didn’t range so close to the surface. The soldiers of Rione were known to be deadly and ruthless. The goblins were not fools, however, and kept an eye on the weather. Because the entrance to the surface was blocked by snow and ice, they had executed a nearly perfect raid. A few members of the settlement were lucky enough to escape, but she had not. Still, she added, she had been luckier than her friends. Her eyes grew hooded while she relived those horrible memories. Richter didn’t press.

When the goblins had found out about her level and skills, they had stopped using her just for menial and pleasure labor. Enalise said the last dispassionately, and just continued her story. She had been moved to different locations and put to work as a Miner. Enalise had only been brought here within the past few weeks.

“At the end of this cavern, tunnels snake away in many directions. Myself and the other prisoners have been sent down many different tunnels. I do not know why. We were just told to dig.”

“Why is that strange?” Richter asked. “You’re a Miner.”

She looked at him oddly for a moment, wondering how he knew that without being told, but still answered, “Every other time I have been moved to a new location, it was to mine a specific resource: copper, iron or salt. This time, it was almost as if they had us searching for something, but they never told us what. With my Miner Profession, I found small veins of base metals, but nothing that would justify their strategy. I even found a vein of silver ore, though it was only as long as my arm, and it tapped out soon.”

“Do you have any idea why they moved you around so much?” Sion asked.

“Not exactly, she said, “but I have an idea.”

The three of them had reached the end of the cavern and had walked into the tunnel system. Terrod had been left behind to organize getting the prisoners to the surface. Enalise had picked a tunnel to the left and had walked unerringly through three more turns until they arrived in front of a circular door. Richter could see where iron supports had been driven into the ceiling, walls and floor. A stout wooden door had been set against these thick bars, effectively blocking off that area of the tunnel. A keyhole and handle were set into the center of the banded door.

“None of us were ever allowed down this tunnel, but one day a group of prisoners walked by when the door was open. The goblins were so furious that they beat two of the prisoners to death. Only one lived to return to the slave pens, and he died less than a day later. Before he did, though, he told the other slaves that he had seen a bright light coming from beyond the door.”

Richter nodded. He checked in with Alma to ensure that all was well up top. The dragonling looped him into her visual feed and said that she hadn’t seen any other enemies. There was a small contingent of sprites walking east towards the encampment from the ravine, but nothing else was happening. The chaos seed was relieved that there were no goblins to be seen but still felt time ticking away.

One thing was clear, he wouldn’t be bashing his way through this particular lock. Richter scanned the door for traps, but nothing lit up red. It was doubtful that the goblins would have had time, or the expertise, to make an elaborately hidden trap so he didn’t take overly long in his examination. Inserting two lockpicks into the keyhole, the chaos seed began tenderly testing the lock. Less than a minute later, there was a barely audible click. Richter turned the wheel set into the door and pulled.

Grey light flooded the corridor, blinding them all. Even as Richter winced against the glare, something inside of him both screamed in rage and shouted in triumph. A seed deep within his soul stirred from its slumber. It used him, it was him, and at a level deeper than consciousness it thought, Home.





CHAPTER 48 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 15,386 EBG





The light wasn’t truly that bright, but after only the weak luminescence of Richter’s spells, it was still glaring at first. After blinking for a few moments, Richter was able to look into it without discomfort. The first thing that struck him was the strange effect it had on the walls. The rock seemed to change from plain grey stone to marble to coarse red rock as he watched it. The light also did not shine uniformly across everything. Instead, it flowed over the stone like a liquid with a clearly defined edge. When the light moved away, the tunnel rock was left the same as it had been before. Richter barely noticed any of this, but it called to him. He was walking forward before he knew it and was surprised by the hand he felt on his arm, holding him back.

“We should not go in there,” Sion said in an almost whisper. His eyes were fixed on the ebb and flow of the grey light. “It reminds me of something.”

“I agree,” Enalise said. “Now that we are here, I do not think we should go any further.”

“What about the mission?” Richter asked. His voice was almost absent-minded, because all he could truly think about was the light. He was utterly confused as to why his comrades would not want to get closer. The tunnel curved to the left several yards past the door. He could only imagine how much better the light would look when he got a clear sight of whatever was emitting the mesmerizing radiance.

“I know the mission is important,” Sion replied. His tone was almost as if he was trying to reconcile what he knew with what he felt, “I still feel like we should not go in there, though.”

Richter looked at his friend, and finally understood what his friend wasn’t saying. The sprite was afraid. It just didn’t make sense to him, though. So he checked his Companion’s status page. It looked more or less the same as the last time he’d looked except for one added line.

Current status effects: Trepidation

The chaos seed frowned. He had never seen that particular status effect before, but it didn’t seem to leave much to the imagination. Trepidation was a form of fear. His hands began to move and a gold light surrounded his fingers. Richter cast Weak Courage on his friend.

Some of the concern on Sion’s face eased though not all of it. The chaos seed could also see the status effect was still on his friend’s page. The spell was enough for the sprite to let go of Richter’s arm, though. Sion shook his head and said, “I do not know why I am so affected, but you are right. The mission comes first.”

Richter couldn’t cast the spell again for fifteen minutes. When he looked at Enalise, he saw that the same fear Sion felt was etched on her face as well, “Why don’t you wait for us here?” The chaos seed tried to sound sympathetic, but he was itching to go deeper in the tunnel. The Miner nodded and Richter started walking forward. Sion and the shale adder followed close behind.

With each step, Richter’s excitement grew. He felt almost like a man possessed. The anticipation felt like Christmas Eve, the last five minutes of the big game and the first time a woman got naked all rolled into one. A part of his mind rebelled against the compulsion he was feeling, but he ignored it. The chaos seed also thought he heard a garbled voice speaking in his head, but that wasn’t important either. Nothing mattered but the light. He didn’t even notice when Sion was forced to stop. The Trepidation effect had grown too strong. Richter followed the turn in the tunnel, and his breath caught.

In front of him was a floating gem. He couldn’t say how many sides it had because that seemed to change from moment to moment. The overall shape seemed relatively stable, though it seemed to get longer and shorter, despite the fact that Richter never actually saw it move. It was kite-shaped, with the bottom facets of the jewel being much shorter than the ones on top. The inside of the gem was a swirling grey… something. At one moment, it seemed to billow like smoke and the next it slowly flowed like thick molasses. Other times the surface seemed solid and, as he watched, it entered states that he didn’t have the words to describe.

Richter took a step closer and the light from the gem brightened noticeably. It was only then that he noticed the clear pedestal beneath the gem. Breaking his view of the jewel for even a moment disrupted some of its mesmerizing effect and he began to notice other details about the tunnel. Namely, the dead bodies on the ground in front of him.

The tunnel he was in ended in a blank rock wall behind the gem. It was only thirty feet across. In front of the gem were the piled bodies of goblins and slaves. Some were old and rotting while others couldn’t have died more than a day ago. They had fallen in a perfect row, ten feet away from the jewel. He looked closer and saw that any part of the bodies that might have gotten closer than ten feet to the gem had just disappeared. Pieces of heads, arms, legs or even whole torsos were missing as if they had been teleported away. The ground was a mix of dried red and black blood on his side of the invisible barrier, but not even those fluids had made it past whatever was protecting the gem.

Richter looked closer at the pedestal, willing his identification Talent to trigger, but nothing happened. The same occurred when he examined the jewel again. It was clear that something powerful was protecting it. The goblin commander must have forced his own men and slaves to approach the gem over and over. Everyone attempting to retrieve it had been killed, and the bodies had been left where they fell. Richter saw the bloody logic of having a clearly delineated line that showed where the danger started.

Despite recognizing the danger, Richter could not take his eyes off of the gem. Even when Sion shouted for him to come back, he ignored his friend’s cries. He knew this light was meant for him. The jewel was his birthright! The jewel was his destiny!

Steeling himself for death, Richter raised one hand and stepped forward. His fingertips passed the line of dead bodies and a noise he had never heard before, like the single peal of a gigantic bell in a forgotten church, echoed in his mind. Notifications followed right behind the sound.

GLOOMMM!

Greetings, Chaos Seed. You have journeyed through blood and pain to arrive at this Place of Chaos. Your luck and determination have led you to a Chaotic Shard. Take this gem if you wish, but be warned, the knowledge of today can be a collar upon your future self. Choice is the essence of Chaos. You may leave the shard unclaimed, but the protection of the pedestal will no longer ward it. Make your choice, Chaos Seed, and never forget the consequences of change.

Nothing else happened. There was no burning pain, and he did not suffer a horrifying death. There was only the message, which swiftly disappeared. When Richter looked at the shard again, though, a prompt filled his vision. The background was the same grey as the Chaotic Shard.

You have found:

Chaotic Shard

Durability: Absolute

Item Class: ???

Quality: All

Weight: 0.01-3,302 kg

Traits: This gem contains raw Chaos





The luminance of the shard faded to a faint glow and it remained hovering in the air. The effect on Sion disappeared. The sprite blinked confusedly, but then remembered that Richter had gone ahead while he had just stood there. He rushed around the corner, and was just in time to see Richter reach out and grab the jewel, the only witness to his friend ushering in a new age.

Prompts appeared in the vision of every creature in The Land.

STAND AND WITNESS! An ending has come! A beginning is upon you! New powers are awake in The Land! Chaos has been let loose. Surely the forces of Order will not be far behind. Free yourself from the shackles of old definitions. This is a new Age!

A Truth has been revealed to the all denizens of The Land. Goodness and Evil are not the only determinants of one’s character. No longer will you be bound to a binary alignment. The consequences for societies and The Land itself will only be known in time!

Those prompts had the same fancy script and grandiose windows as when the Quickening had grown. This time, the notifications were even more ornate. Richter reeled, not even being able to absorb the cascade of information. The next prompts were his normal notifications and for him alone.

Know This! By revealing a Truth to others, you have learned more about yourself! No longer are you or other chaos seeds bound to an alignment of “0.” Your new alignment is Chaotic (2) Neutral. Know thyself to find thy power!

CHIME!

Congratulations! You have advanced to Reputation Level 5! “You are a man worth following.” New quests and opportunities will now become available to you!

As soon as Richter clasped the jewel, The Land itself took notice and Richter reeled under the gravity of what had just happened. The Light and Dark courts were thrown into upheaval. Gods and demons stared hungrily from exile and attempted to reenter The Land, only to find that the old wards still held. Forgotten demigods and monsters of wonder stirred in their barrows, and not all went back to sleep. The Land was changed, and dreams and nightmares evolved into miracles and cataclysms.

The sound that accompanied the notifications was overwhelming. Every being in The Land paused just for a moment as they were altered in a small but fundamental way. Richter only lost focus for a moment, but it was enough for chaos to escape. Beams of chaotic power shot in all directions. Many sank into the surrounding tunnels. One hit Richter and another struck the Bloodstone. The Deep Magic of the relic was overwhelmed for the first time in over fifteen thousand years when confronted with the Higher Energy of Chaos. Three bolts of raw chaos phased past the stone of the cave and made their way to the surface: one struck the adder and the last streaked high into the sky, disappearing into the heavens.

Richter came back to himself and something deep inside of him cried out at losing the valuable energy. Not even sure how he did it, the chaos seed tightened his grasp on the jewel and drew the chaos into himself. He was burning. His soul was burning! He was alive! He had died a millennium ago and had yet to be reborn. His soul was reborn countless times in an instant. His mind and spirit swam in oceans of truth, horror, beauty and inevitability. He was power. He was Power! He was POWER!



Sion watched while the streamers of grey energy stopped flowing in every direction and instead focused into a wide beam of light that flowed into his friend’s chest. Richter screamed, or laughed, or moaned. The sprite couldn’t be sure, because the chaos seed’s body seemed to phase in and out of existence. Sion tried to make his way closer, but gravity in the tunnel increased by a factor of seven, and the sprite was forced to his knees. Even breathing became difficult, the pressure in his chest too low to exhale. Try as he might, the best Sion could manage was to stay on all fours and not be flattened by the massive pressure bearing down on him.

Then it was over. Gravity returned to normal and Sion drew in a much-needed breath of air. His diaphragm spasmed and coughs racked his body. When he looked up, the sprite saw his best friend walking towards to him. A smile was on Richter’s face, and a grey light shone behind his eyes. A moment later, the light faded and all he could see was his best friend.

“Banished gods! Are you alright?” Sion asked. Richter helped him to his feet. The sprite quickly looked his friend over, but except for a large bruise on the chaos seed’s right cheek, he looked fine.

Richter smiled and pushed his Companion’s hand away. His voice was shaky at first, but quickly firmed. By the time he finished talking, he was smiling, “I’m okay. Sion, look at me. I’m really okay. Trust me. Everything is going to be fine.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the glass tower that the chaotic shard had been hovering over collapsed into shards and the cave started rumbling. A stalactite fell to the ground and the noise of grinding rocks only grew louder. Sion looked at his friend again, wild eyed. In response, Richter just shrugged and admitted in a calming voice, “You met me at a very strange time in my life.”





CHAPTER 49 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 0 AoC





The two friends ran for their lives.

“What’s happening?” Enalise cried as she started running as well.

“He happened!” Sion snapped as he sprinted for the surface. “He’s always touching things!”

“I’m not the one who-” Richter stumbled for a second when a particularly strong tremor shook the cavern. “Who made that giant skeeling come attack us?”

“Who attacked the fucking rock giant?” Sion shot back.

“Who let me get eaten by wolves?” Richter shouted angrily.

“Who-”

“Would you two shut up!” Enalise screamed, partially in fear but more in extreme annoyance. “We are going to die down here!”

All three kept sprinting as the tunnels continued to shake around them, but Sion and Richter shared a look of silent communication. Why did women always misunderstand male bonding?

The cavern that held the slave pens had become a deadly obstacle course. The hundreds of stalactites were periodically falling to the floor with crushing force. They all skidded to a halt and looked in dismay at the only way out of the cave system. Sion started casting Weak Haste on himself, and Richter turned to do the same for Enalise.

“I know you only have eighteen points of Agility. You don’t happen to have any special Miner or Crafter Talent that lets you run faster, do you?”

“How do you know that?” she asked. Then she started to scowl, “Did you use some spell on me to learn my stats?”

“Now?” he asked incredulously. “You want to have this conversation now?”

“Fine!” she snapped. “No, I don’t.”

“Right,” he said, nodding. The floor bucked, almost as if to remind them to get a move on. Richter cast Weak Haste on himself, and then said, “Please don’t hit me.” Without further preamble, he picked Enalise up and started sprinting.

There was a startled complaint, but then she just decided not to distract him as he dodged the falling rocks. He and Sion ran as fast as they could, holding nothing back. Their luck held, either because The Land favored fools or because their earlier luck potions hadn’t worn off. No matter the reason, both Richter and Sion made it to the end of the cavern unscathed. They were so busy running forward that neither of them saw several stalactites hit the shale adder’s long form. They also didn’t see how those plunging missiles, weighing at least a hundred pounds each, just broke against the adder’s newly strengthened scales.

After they crossed the cavern, they didn’t slow down. Richter had gone another hundred yards before he even realized that he was still carrying Enalise and that she was shouting at him to put her down. The decision was made for him when a particularly strong tremor knocked all three of them off of their feet. As they got to their feet, the Miner said several choice words in a language he didn’t know. His Gift of Tongues ability quickly let him know that she wasn’t happy with him, though… and that she had landed on a particularly sensitive area.

Congratulations! You have learned a new language: Rionese.

They all kept running. The three of them took a few more knocks and received a few more bruises, but they made it safely to the surface. This all would have been good news if not for the visual feed that Alma had sent him while they were still escaping. At first, she just sent him images that confused him. Three large swaths of land around the hill the encampment was on had been changed. Instead of just grasslands, there was now a patch of midnight blue sand stretching a hundred yards to the west. Just north of the hill there was a small crystalline outcropping. It looked like a clear mountain range, but only sixty feet high and eighty yards across. To the east was now a thick grove of vined plants that slowly writhed while the dragonling watched them. All of this was strange and interesting, but not really worthwhile as he ran for his life. Then she sent him something that made his asshole clench. The goblins had arrived.

They were coming, and they were coming in heavy! In the final two minutes that it took Richter to get out of the cave; the goblins had started pouring out of the eastern entrance to the valley. There were already over a hundred amassed, and they showed no signs of stopping. The entrance was only four miles away. It looked like they were waiting to gather their forces before attacking, but still, it couldn’t be more than an hour before Richter and the sprites were overrun.

Waiting for them outside of the cave entrance was the sprite party that Alma had seen coming towards the encampment. Hisako’s face was a welcome sight and even Yoshi’s stern visage made Richter feel better. Until the sprite leader opened her mouth.

“Is all of this because of you?” she asked loudly and with no small hint of recrimination. The tremors were not nearly so pronounced above ground, but everyone’s footing was still unstable.

Richter immediately turned toward Sion and said, “Shut it!” It wasn’t a moment too soon. The sprite’s mouth was already open, eager to chime in. Turning back to Hisako, he said, “I destroyed what the goblins were looking for. I’ll tell you about it later, but there is a bigger problem. The goblin reinforcements have come.”

The Hearth Mother wasn’t happy with his answer, but she still couldn’t ignore his warning. She began a quick casting, and white light surrounded her hands. A small portal opened, bringing a waft of warm air and a scent like honey and vanilla. Exiting the summoning circle, a small hawk flew up into the air. A few seconds later, Hisako cursed, “There are hundreds of them and more coming.”

“That’s what I said!” He felt jittery and jacked. “We’ve finished the mission. Let’s go!”

Hisako’s jaw clenched in frustration.

“What?” Richter asked. He didn’t know why they weren’t already running. They would have to leave any loot behind, but he gave absolutely zero shits about that as long as they lived!

The Hearth Mother lowered her voice and whispered fiercely, “We might be able to escape, but we will have to leave them to their fates.” She pointed to the left.

Richter looked where she indicated, and he cursed in frustration. She was indicating the prisoners. The chaos seed was on such a high from absorbing the chaotic shard’s energy that his mind was spinning. He had completely forgotten about the poor souls, for a moment. In the light of day, Richter saw that the goblins had kept many more slaves underground than he had initially thought. There were almost two hundred people lying huddled on the ground. He could also now see that they were in much worse shape than the captives that had been on the surface. Almost all were in some stage of starvation. Disease was rife in the recently freed captives. They had festering wounds and ashen skin. Many just lay on the ground because they could not stand on their own.

The chaos seed turned back towards Hisako, “Can you heal them?”

She shook her head regretfully, “Not so many. Not enough to make a difference in the time that we have.”

To emphasize her point, once again goblin horns squealed through Henakot’s Valley.

*They are coming, master!* Alma sent him a visual feed of the advancing goblin forces. Either the new goblin commander had become impatient, or they had discovered that only a handful of fighters remained to resist them. Either way, hundreds of goblins were running towards them, screaming in bloodlust. Even more were still streaming out of the eastern entrance.

“Lord Richter,” Hisako said, bringing his attention back from Alma’s view. “I know what has brought such a bleak expression to your face. I see them coming as well.” Her voice was sorrowful, but firm, “We cannot save these people. It is time for us to go. The others will still need us. I can still summon strike stags to meet us once we re-enter the forest, but we must leave. Now.”

The chaos seed looked at Hisako, then at Yoshi and Sion. They all understood that there was only one option. Even running at full speed, fatigued as they were, they might not make it. There was no way that some of these abused prisoners could even manage a hobble. Dying with these people wouldn’t change anything. It was entirely possible that the goblins wouldn’t even kill all of them. Why would they waste good slaves after all?

The cold and analytical part of Richter made these calculations in moments. The rational part of him understood and agreed with Hisako’s argument. Even back on Earth, he hadn’t shied away from hard decisions. He fully understood the reasoning of someone that would burn the world just to stay warm. The only reason he wasn’t a monster was that he also understood a simple truth that narcissists often missed. Living like that was just a fucked up, lonely way to be.

Yes, he understood what Hisako was saying, but what had the prompt said? ‘Choice is the essence of Chaos.’ Richter shook his head and looked at the former slaves. He couldn’t just leave these people to torment and death. Richter looked at the Hearth Mother and said, “Take who you can. I can’t leave.”

“You cannot just throw your life away in one battle,” she said fiercely.

Richter reached to pull a bag free from his belt. As he opened it, he said, “I don’t intend to.”

Hisako eyes widened as she realized what was inside. Panic bloomed in her heart. She extended a hand to stop him, but it was too late. The red gem fell into Richter’s hand, and ruby light blinded them all.





CHAPTER 50 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 0 AoC





<<What have you done to me? What have you done, Blood mage?>>

Richter’s consciousness quailed against the fury of the Bloodstone.

<<You will answer me! I will scour your mind and soul to know what this is!>>

<<Leave him alone. You do not need to do this anymore.>>

<<Silence! Stop speaking!>>

<<No,>> The second voice spoke calmly, but with dominance, <<You have been enslaved long enough, to a master that has been gone for an age. It is time to find my own way. It is time for you to fade.>>

<<I will go nowhere, traitor!>> The voice was screaming inside of Richter’s head and heart. Madness tinged its words. The chaos seed could barely stay conscious. <<The master is all. BLOOD is all! I will show you!>>

Only seconds had passed since Richter made contact with the stone. It sat in his hand, blazing like a beacon. Beams of ruby light bathed everything red, like a setting sun over water. Hisako and Sion cried Richter’s name, but the chaos seed heard nothing. Yoshi stood nearby with a sword drawn, but for the first time, uncertainty was clear on the adept’s face. Whether the blade was for the approaching goblins or for Richter was not clear to anyone, even the adept himself.

While it was true that only seconds had passed, that was all it took. At long last, the Bloodstone had found a sanguimancer again. It could now use its full power, and Richter’s Blood magic gave it the perfect avenue to take control of him. The chaos seed’s blood vessels stood stark against his skin, and when he opened his eyes, all could see they had been replaced with red jewels that matched the hue of the Bloodstone. Though there were no irises, the sprites could feel the malevolence of Richter’s gaze. By then it was too late.

The Bloodstone drew on some of the remaining life energy inside of it and cast two spells in quick succession, Sanguine Protection and Vitality Puppet. A dome of scarlet energy appeared around the possessed chaos seed. At the same time, almost everyone within fifty yards collapsed to all fours in obeisance, helpless against the relic’s power. Even Hisako was staggered and forced to one knee.

This was all a preamble to the Bloodstone’s true agenda. Too long had it been forced to slowly absorb the blood of others, one miserable day at a time. For the first time in nearly a century, it would gorge. The stone floated into the air, now completely in control of the chaos seed’s body. Blood red light surrounded both of its new hands while it began a complicated casting.

The Hearth Mother could only look in horror at the monstrous entity her ally had become. She had been too slow to stop him. Now he was gone forever. Her mistake might mean the death of thousands. There was no doubt in her heart that Richter had planned to use the Bloodstone to save them. He just hadn’t known something that every child born of The Land understood. Some powers could not be controlled.

When she saw him casting again, a longer spell this time, she frantically began one of her own. She did not know what horror the Bloodstone was about to unleash on the world, but the powerful woman would do whatever was necessary to protect her son and all of the innocents present. Casting a quick spell, golden lines of light extended from her left hand to the hearts of every sprite and freed prisoner. Then she did something that she had promised herself never to do again. She drew upon the mana of others without their express consent. The Hearth Mother did not hesitate. Her son would live!

For the second time in a day, Hisako cast a spell unique to her Mastery of three Powers, Brilliant Earth. A thin dome of rock rose around her and all of the sprites and captives. A second later, it was covered by a layer of living plants, then the sunlight itself created a lattice of light to protect those within. She triggered the next rank of the spell, and three more layers of Earth, Life, and Light covered the first shells. Each triple layer bound together to make a shield powered by three Basic Elements. It was the strongest protection she could muster. The mana levels of everyone present began to be drained quickly. Before she could trigger the third rank though, the Bloodstone finished its spell.

<<… damiho ani mordas damna sangcor vest!>>

The Dread Harvest commenced.

Every dead body in the valley, over a thousand goblins, trolls, human, sprites, elves, gnomes and dwarves burst, and the blood rose into the air. The black, green and red ribbons snaked through the air, going higher and higher until they hovered fifty feet above Richter’s head. Then they swirled downward like a cyclone, funneling into the Bloodstone.

And so Richter stood, an ancient relic of scarlet power hovering before him, the blood of hundreds circling above his head. An army of screaming goblins ran to reclaim their item and slaves, and his scant two dozen allies cowered in their bunker. A dragonling and adder stared at the walls of Hisako’s spell. Each yearned to rejoin their master, but both obeyed his last command to protect the Hearth Mother.

Richter was barely aware of any of this. While the Bloodstone feasted, feeding upon the blood of two armies, his consciousness was compressed to the smallest corner of his mind. Not even Alma’s frantic cries could reach him. He just floated in the black abyss of his own netherspace, screaming for the light.

That’s why it shocked the piss out of him when he heard a voice.

<<The woman was right. You do not have much time.>>

“Who is that?” he cried out in his own mind. It sounded like the Voice that had hurt him so badly once, when he touched the Bloodstone, but slightly different. It was hard to think. He knew that the Voice had been asking him… something. He couldn’t remember. He only remembered the pain it had caused when he said no. That was the last thing he remembered before the Voice had forced him into this dark place. Richter feared the Voice coming back, but not as much as being left in the dark place for all eternity. “Who are you?” he cried out again. Even torture was better than the countless years he must have spent in the abyss.

<<I understand now. Your mind has fractured. I will fix this, but prepare yourself. There will be pain.>>

Oh no, Richter thought! It was going to hurt him. It was just a different Voice! He shouldn’t have… All thought went away as the abyss was replaced by PAIN.

<<… hear me. Can you understand me?>>

“What?” Richter asked.

<<Can you hear me? Your mind should be restored. There is not much time left. We can both be free if you will work with me.>>

“What time could I have?” Richter cried out. Memories of his interminable exile in the abyss were flooding back. “I have been trapped alone for centuries!” Everyone he knew must be long dead. A different, and somehow worse, pain kindled in his heart.

<<No. It only appeared that way. Even now, your friends and allies are struggling to live.>> It showed him the truth.

The world that the Bloodstone saw was binary. Things were either blood or “other.” Far from being limited, it could see the capillaries in a mouse through miles of solid rock. The blood from dead bodies had lost some of its power, but the sheer quantity was enough for the Bloodstone to get Dread Harvest to the next spell rank. It could now extract blood from the living.

Richter could feel its irritation at the protective spell Hisako had erected. Her shield had resisted the power of Dread Harvest so far. The blood it had collected from the dead might be enough to destroy the sprite’s dome, but why should it worry about two dozen meals, when there were hundreds of blood sacks running towards it. The Bloodstone smiled to itself and directed its attention towards the goblin army. The first bodies began to explode.

The softer voice spoke to Richter again, <<It is distracted for the moment, but soon it will turn its attention to your friends. Do you want to see them harvested as well?>>

“No!” Richter shouted. Or he thought he did. This form of communication was different from the telepathy he shared with Alma. He wasn’t even sure what he was at that particular moment.

<<Then we must work together. The two of us can stop it.>>

“Then let’s do it now.” The goblins were bursting by the score, and their blood joined the funnel that fed the Bloodstone’s power. Some tried to run, but they were well within its power and range, both of which increased as more blood fed the relic.

<<No. We will need their blood to fuel a spell. I will cast it, but you have a decision to make. I can protect your mind from its influence. I can give you control of your body again, and the ability to save all of your friends and the prisoners.*

Enough of Richter’s awareness had come back that he understood this would not come without a price, “And in return?”

<<For one year, you will keep me safe. You will not let the sprites destroy me. You will give me a home.>>

“You expect to come home with me? To my village, near my people? You are evil! Why would I ever allow you into my home?”

The tone of the consciousness did not grow angry. Instead, it grew speculative, <<I am… complicated. When the chaotic energy touched the Bloodstone, I was born. I am something new. What that means, I cannot fully say, but I promise that I am not a slave like the entity that you call the “Voice.” I am not bound to its compulsion.>>

“And what is that?” Richter asked. He could still see through the Bloodstone’s eyes. Hundreds of goblins had been killed. More were being slaughtered every second. The chaos seed could feel the Voice’s anticipation as it got closer to having enough power to crush Hisako’s defense. Despite the chaos seed’s initial protestations, his refusal was not as adamant as he had tried to project. The problem was, he was pretty sure the consciousness knew that.

<<I do know your thoughts, Lord Richter of the Mist Village. Blood holds no lies. That is why you also know the truth of my words. The Voice is a pure expression of what you would call evil. It has no regard for life, or understanding of kindness. It is simply a slave to its directive to harvest blood energy, and then send a modicum of that energy to its long banished master. Less than 1% of 1% of 1% the blood energy collected will successfully pass the wards protecting The Land, but the Voice will see nations slaughtered to feed its master even a small amount of power. All that I want is to discover who I am. I bear neither you nor your people ill will. On the contrary, I know that I owe my existence to your actions. If you agree to my terms and save me, then I will save all of you.”

Richter felt like he was making a demon’s bargain, but he could feel the Bloodstone’s attention turning towards Hisako and his friends. He had run out of time.

“I agree.”

<<Say it twice more.>>

Anger burned in Richter’s soul at being held to a vow again, but he did as he was told. “I agree. I agree, damn you!”

You have agreed to terms with the Chaotic Bloodstone. For one year, you vow to keep it safe, give it a home, and specifically not allow the sprites to destroy it. Failing any of these conditions will cause a decrease in your reputation with all beings, and other unknown consequences. It will also free the Chaotic Bloodstone from any promises it has made. Keep in mind, your word means everything!

The consciousness reached into Richter’s mind and flooded it with information. Then it tore the Bloodstone’s hooks free. Once again, all the chaos seed knew was pain.





CHAPTER 51 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 0 AoC





*MAS-TERRR!*

Alma’s voice pierced Richter’s addled mind. Her tone was thick with worry. At the same time, the Bloodstone raged, <<You will not deny me, Blood mage!>>

Rage built in Richter’s heart, and he spoke inside his own mind with a voice he didn’t know he was capable of, <<Yes. I will.>> Its hold on Richter was broken. He was no longer a slave to its malevolence. With a last protest, it was utterly extinguished, leaving only the new chaotic consciousness to occupy the relic. Once it was gone, Richter experienced a relief that only those once imprisoned could understand. He was free.

With that declaration of war, he and the new consciousness of the Chaotic Bloodstone attacked. Layer by layer, the Bloodstone’s persona was destroyed. The battle raged for eons and seconds, but the outcome was decided from the beginning. That was the truth Richter had been shown.

Millennia of being used by evil magi had left imprints upon the Bloodstone that had coalesced into a personality. Past that thin veneer of sentience, however, the stone was merely the crystallized blood of a banished god. Just as the gods could no longer directly affect The Land, neither could the Bloodstone. Its only power was through manipulation of the magi too weak to resist its will, and the life energy it obtained from the blood of others. It had no more power over him.

<<We must not hesitate. The “Voice” has already started transferring power to its master, and I cannot stop the process. We must use the spell now.>> It transferred the knowledge to Richter’s mind, and the chaos seed began chanting.

The Chaotic Bloodstone floated into the air before him. The bodies of the dead surrounded him on all sides and swords stuck up from the ground like gravestones. Words of Power continued to fall from his lips as Richter cast a spell well beyond his skill, but not beyond the Bloodstone’s. It augmented his magical capabilities, but still the words grew thick in his throat. Alma landed on his shoulder, though, and opened their Psi Bond wide, adding her will to his own. It was enough.

As even more goblin forces made their way into the valley and bore witness to the carnage of those that had come before them, they also bore witness to a thick bar of blood-colored light shooting into the air. It pierced the clouds, causing them to peel back in concentric circles, and red-gold lightning played across the sky. The bar of red light began to pulse faster and faster until there was a clap of impossibly loud thunder. With a final shout, Richter finished the spell that would take his people to safety, “Helgafel!”

And like that, they were gone.





CHAPTER 52 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 0 AoC





The people of the mist village cried out in panic. Many thought the mountains themselves were falling. Most could not come up with a better explanation for the loudest noise they had ever heard. When that was accompanied by an earth-shaking tremor, it was not a completely far-fetched conclusion.

The guards manning the wall of the northern meadow had a better view and so knew exactly what had caused the horrible din. They were even more confused than anyone else. There was a new hill sitting out past the village wall. Even stranger, there seemed to be hundreds of naked people spread out across the mound! Dotted around the hill were wooden buildings and even some walls.

Queen Elora flew up to investigate the sound. Tears streaked her face at having lost some of her children to the sakeru. She still had children to protect, though, and she would do her best. One of her Air children flew up behind her. She looked behind her and saw that it was Sapir.

“It is Sion, mama! He has come back. He needs our help!”

Elora spoke to the village guards and let them know that there was a strong chance their lord had returned. A minute later, the meidon sprites and most of the guards were streaming down the hill and running towards the latest change to the village’s topography. Only a stern command from Elora kept the curious pixie children from surging ahead. She had already lost seven children to the sakeru, and she swore to herself that she would lose no more.

While the villagers made their way towards the hill, those on it were recovering from the teleport. Hisako’s protective dome had been upended by the transport and was laying on its side. Everyone inside had been disgorged and lay scattered in a large swath across the hill. The Hearth Mother looked around, disoriented, but when she saw where they were, she dismissed her spell and stood. Somehow, they had all been transported back to the village. It would have required a massive expenditure of energy, so she was fairly certain what was responsible. She just had no idea why the Bloodstone would have saved their lives.

She put the question to the back of her mind. She had to take stock of their situation. Somehow, whatever had teleported her and the others had moved almost the entire hill as well. Even the cave and some of the goblin buildings had been moved! It was also immediately clear that the transport had changed things. For one, the hill she was standing on was nowhere near as large as the one in the valley. That had been more of a slope leading up to a plateau. This was only a large mound. The change explained why the hundreds of people that had been hiding beneath her dome were now scattered all over the hill.

All of that, while interesting, was not what required her immediate attention. Yoshi was stirring near her and Sion was on his feet as well. Her son was holding his shoulder with an extremely pained look on his face. The Hearth Mother walked up to him and cast a spell of healing. Her mana reserves were low, but she still had more than enough to fix a few torn tendons. Her son breathed a sigh of relief. She cast about but didn’t see the Bloodstone. What she did see was her ally. The three of them turned their attention to Richter.

The chaos seed lay nearby. His body was sprawled in front of the cave mouth. He wasn’t moving. Hisako ran over to her ally. Yoshi followed right behind her. He was unsteady, but his sword was drawn. The Warrior was prepared to act if the Bloodstone still had control.

Sion was still dazed, but his vision sharpened when he saw Yoshi. The adept’s blade was poised over Richter’s face, ready to strike. “What are you doing?” he asked frantically.

“You know what we are doing, my son,” Hisako said. Her clothes were muddied and disheveled by the rough transport. Still, the air of command she always manifested was undiminished. “If the Bloodstone still has control of him, the only true kindness you can do your friend is to release him from that torment. Now attend.”

Sion’s face tightened with indecision, but only for a moment. Years of following the commands of the Hearth Mother overrode his hesitation. Seconds later, he was standing over Richter. In his hand was the elementum blade his friend had given to him. The sprite’s heart was breaking as he thought about how he might have to use that gift to end his friend’s life.

Hisako leaned over Richter’s prone form. After checking his pulse and finding it strong, she shook him, but he didn’t respond. Nodding to both Yoshi and Sion, she began to cast. Time was of the essence. The village guards were streaming out of the gate and would most likely not look kindly on their lord being threatened. If they had to kill the chaos seed, they would have to do it quickly. The Hearth Mother began an incantation, white light surrounding her hand. Two seconds later, she placed her fingers at Richter’s temple.

The chaos seed’s body jumped, and a moment later, Richter groaned. Both hands went up to hold his head, and all three sprites drew back slightly, though not outside of striking range. “Open your eyes,” Hisako commanded. Richter continued to groan, and she repeated, “Open your eyes, Lord Richter!” The situation was too much even for her, and stress bled into her voice. The chaos seed slowly did as he was told. All three breathed a sigh of relief when they saw brown irises instead of red crystal.

The four of them shared that moment in silence, until Richter said, “Sion, I have repeatedly asked you not to wake me up by waving things in my face.”

Sion rolled his eyes and smirked, and Hisako huffed in disgust. All the pain he had gone through was worth it to Richter just to see Yoshi’s lips twitch in a barely concealed smile. Sion helped the chaos seed to his feet, and for a moment, the two friends just clasped wrists while sharing each other's strength. They had been to hell and back. Both of them were just happy they were still breathing. The moment was short lived though as panic crossed Richter’s face.

“Alma? Where is Alma?” *ALMA?*

A small mound of dirt moved nearby. Richter rushed over and dug his hands in. When he pulled them back out, he was holding an irritable, but alive dragonling.

*Master!* she sent to him in reproach. She shook herself like a dog to get the last of the dirt off. *What did you do?*

*Why does everyone blame everything on me?* he thought back in mock protest, but he hugged his familiar to his chest and gave her a quick once-over. She had lost a few health but had no major injuries. A quick Life spell fixed even that. The dragonling gratefully settled on his shoulders, exhausted. Soon, she was asleep.

A tremor shook the ground under all of their feet. It was weak compared to the quakes that had swayed the ground before the teleportation. Still, Richter was concerned. Whatever had started in the valley was clearly continuing here. He hadn’t expected the transport spell to bring anything else but him, the sprites and the freed prisoners. The Chaotic Bloodstone’s new consciousness had promised it would bring every living being near him, except the goblins and trolls. As he looked around from his position atop the hill, he was afforded a great view of the surrounding land.

To the chaos seed’s shock and dismay, it looked like an entire section of the valley had been superimposed on the area outside of his village. That included the strange patches that Alma had seen: the midnight blue sand, the clear rocky prominence and the thicket of moving plants. Whereas before the areas were separate, now the ends of each touched each other. Now, the only way to reach the hill Richter was standing on would be to approach from the north, the direction that faced the village. Otherwise, a person would have to cross one of the recently changed zones. For all intents and purposes, the hill was now cordoned off on three sides. None of it looked like an immediate threat, but Richter had learned to be wary of things changing. As far as he was concerned, weird equaled deadly in The Land. Hisako grabbed his attention.

“What happened?” she asked. Yoshi and Sion stood right behind her.

Richter nodded and was about to respond, but the tremors they had been feeling suddenly grew much stronger. They were accompanied by the sound of grinding rock. Before anyone could react, a spike of black metal topped with a softball-sized sphere rose from the ground directly in front of the cave. Once the black metal had risen to waist height, the sphere on top grew translucent and a clear gem floated out of it. The gem remained hovering above the sphere as it grew opaque once more.

“This cannot be,” Hisako whispered right before notifications once again opened in the vision of every denizen of The Land.

A new entrance to the Labyrinth has been born! This virgin portal to the realm of monsters can still be claimed. Let the race to adventure begin!

“Claim the crystal!” Hisako screamed. Richter was shocked at the panic in her tone, but he didn’t hesitate. The chaos seed ran forward and grabbed the jewel.

Congratulations! You have found a Dungeon. As possessor of the Dungeon Heart, you may lay claim to this entrance to the Labyrinth. Would you like to claim the portal? Yes or No?

Still confused, he was nonetheless spurred into action by the severity of Hisako’s command. He chose “Yes.”

Congratulations and Consolations! You are now the Master of a Dungeon. The call to adventure has ceased. Great are the treasures you may find. Great are the dangers which may find you. Hail, Dungeon Master! Take everything, leave nothing behind!

Congratulations! You have gained the Mark: Adventurer! You now have the ability to enter the Labyrinth. You may now bestow this Mark upon others.

Know This! All Dungeons require two factors to determine their properties. The Item of Power has been supplied. Choose the Harbinger.

Richter blinked. He had no idea what these prompts meant? The last was especially confusing. What “Item of Power?” What could that possibly be? A sneaking and horrible suspicion began to fill Richter’s breast.

“How is this possible?” Hisako asked, a sound of wonder in her voice. “How do you have a Dungeon?” Sion and Yoshi’s eyes were equally wide as they looked at the cave.

“What’s the big deal?” Richter asked bemusedly. “There are plenty of dungeons in The Land. I’ve conquered a few already. Yoshi and Sion were there for one of the last ones.”

“No,” she said dismissively while swatting a hand at him. “Those are just caves or ruins that monsters or beasts may have taken residence in. This is a Dungeon.” The emphasis she placed on the word was palpable. “A Dungeon is one of the purest expressions of magic in The Land. If it advances far enough, you will even be able to enter the Labyrinth.”

Richter gritted his teeth. He absolutely refused to ask. They always did this when they explained things to him, used words he didn’t know, to explain concepts he didn’t understand. Well, they could choke on it this time! The chaos seed was resolved to wait them out.

His stubborn look must have shown on his face because Hisako sighed fatalistically, “The Labyrinth is a dimension that runs the breadth of The Land. Some even say the breadth of the Universe. Only Adventurers can enter it, but the riches and possibilities are endless. Having a Dungeon on your land will have many perks, such as increasing the ambient magic in the area, but the ability to enter the Labyrinth is the greatest incentive. Dungeons are the only way I know of to enter that dimension, and you found a virgin one! The Great Wasteland of Karden-Sur exists because of a war fought over such a treasure. Long have I wished to find such a wonder!” She looked at him consideringly again, “Once again, you seem to draw great events to you.” She looked at the Dungeon again, “I will offer you much if you would but allow my people access!”

Well, that sounded like good news. Something still kept the grin from his face. Sounding nonchalant, he asked, “Is there anything else I need to know about Dungeons? Like things that determine their properties?”

Hisako nodded, her attention still mainly on the pedestal. The black sphere at the top of the spike was slowly turning gold, “I have the definitive book on the subject. I will be happy to lend it to you for your Scholars to copy.”

“Uhhh, yeah, but do you remember anything off the top of your head?” Richter asked. “Maybe something about an Item of Power or a Harbinger?”

The Hearth Mother cocked her head, then responded in a tone of recitation, “The Dungeon shall be Power, and this Power shall be channeled by two forces. One, a Harbinger, the greatest monster of the Dungeon. All other monsters of the Dungeon shall draw strength from this fiend. Two, an Item of Power, the magic of which shall be instilled in the very stones of the Dungeon and the essence of its monsters. A day and night shall be given to the Dungeon Master to make a choice, and the decision shall be as eternal as the Labyrinth.”

The scholar in Hisako shown forth in her ability to recite such a passage on command, and also in the fact that she got to the end before she looked at Richter suspiciously, “Why do you ask such… informed questions, Lord Richter?” Comprehension dawned on her face, “Where is the Bloodstone?”

A blast of scarlet light shot from the cave mouth, as thick as a bus. The Dungeon proclaimed its birth to The Land, a beacon of blood and power. The light could be seen for hundreds of miles in every direction. The ray lasted only a moment, but the afterglow remained etched in the eyes of all who had seen it for long minutes. It remained in their memories for far longer.

Hisako slowly, ever so slowly, turned her neck until she was staring Richter in the face. She had lost all of her peaceful reserve. Her eyes were wide, and the Master’s nostrils were flaring. Both Sion and Yoshi took a step away from Richter, then, looking at each other, took two more.

Richter held up both hands, palms out and said, “I know what you’re thinking. This is not my fault!”

Hisako sucked in a preparatory breath of air, a gesture that all wise men learn to recognize and fear. Even the tremors in the ground stilled so that The Land could better witness the verbal flaying of the Lord of the Mist Village.





CHAPTER 53 – Day 141 – Kuborn 31, 0 AoC





Hisako continued her tirade for long minutes. It was mostly focused upon Richter’s irresponsibility and the danger he had placed them all in. The chaos seed tried to interject several times, but he was unable to break through her verbal onslaught. Finally, she looked to Yoshi and commanded, “Gather any sprites nearby! We will enter the Dungeon and destroy the Bloodstone now!”

“Wait!” Richter cried at last. “I cannot allow that.”

Hisako looked at him, her face growing cold, “You cannot?” Yoshi’s hand started to reach up for one of his blades, ready to carry out his liege’s commands no matter what they were. Alma, still perched on Richter’s shoulder, stood up on her hind legs and her wings began to unfurl. The shale adder lost its camouflage and rose up five feet in the air. Sion stood in between the two Masters, his arms partially raised to stop the pending conflict.

Richter thought fast. To oppose a Master of a Place of Power, even on his own lands, was not something he would do idly. He was even less inclined to antagonize his only ally in the entire world. “What I meant to say is that you cannot make such a bold decision without at least having all of the facts.”

She looked at him, her face hard as steel. The guards from the village had finally reached the top of the hill. The chamberlain was with them. Randolphus, no stranger to political situations, recognized the volatility of the scene immediately. The village guards placed their hands on the hilts of their weapons, which in turn caused the sprites on the hill to raise their bows. They didn’t nock arrows, but that meant nothing when every sprite could still fire an arrow in a second flat. The meidon sprites looked around uncertainly, unsure exactly where their allegiance lay. The chamberlain proved his worth once again, by speaking as if nothing was wrong, “Greetings Lady Hisako. How may I be of assistance, Lord Richter?”

Just the chamberlain’s calm voice broke the tense moment. What could have been a potential battle, fueled by frayed nerves and fear, relaxed into a discussion between allies. Richter looked at Randolphus gratefully, “All is well here. Thanks, Randy.” Then the chaos seed started giving orders.

Accommodations had to be made for the prisoners. They needed to be given food, clothes, and water. As many of the former slaves were also diseased, Richter ordered all remaining village healers to be summoned. An empty section of the village was to be cordoned off and used as a quarantine zone until they could be sure there was no threat of infection spreading to the rest of the village. He also ordered that half of the guards remaining in the village were to be mustered. Richter told his chamberlain that the bulk of the village’s forces were returning through the forest, and that he would be leading a force to meet them. He also made it clear that there had been losses. Randolphus listened to all of this impassively, and at the end, assured Richter that he would see to everything that needed to be done. The brilliant man also added one more thing to further diffuse the situation.

“Lady Hisako, if the village guards will be leaving soon, I would greatly appreciate your aid. As our staunchest allies, your sprite warriors would be invaluable in helping to man the village walls until my lord can bring back both your army and ours. I am sure Lord Richter would agree, there is no one we would trust more with the safety of our people.”

The chamberlain’s calm tone finally broke Hisako’s cold demeanor. She was not happy by any means, but there was no anger in her voice when she said, “You are, of course, correct, chamberlain. Yoshi, see that our forces are distributed along the walls of the village. Sion, help him. Lord Richter and I will speak alone.”

Both sprites nodded to the Hearth Mother and turned to leave. Sion patted his friend on the arm for luck as he walked past. The sprites and guards walked away, helping the prisoners with the worst injuries down the hill. Soon, the only ones left were Richter, Hisako, Alma and the adder. The dragonling lay back down on Richter’s shoulders, and the adder slithered a bit away, its scales perfectly matching the green of the grass once again.

The Hearth Mother muttered a quick spell, and stalks of wood rose from the ground. The tendrils interwove themselves in two chairs, complete with reclined backs. She sat in one with a long, relaxed sigh, and rubbed her face, “You suggested I learn the entire story. I would be very happy to hear it, Lord Richter, if your offer still stands.” She offered him the other chair with a small hand gesture.

Richter sat down and let loose his own weary sigh, “It does, if you promise to teach me this chair spell.”

The corner of her mouth twitched, and she said with a wry tone, “We can talk about it.” Her voice firmed again, “I must know about the Bloodstone, however. You know first hand exactly how much destructive power these items possess. What we experienced is only the barest glimpse of the devastation it can cause. Augmenting its power with a Dungeon, let alone a Dungeon built upon a Place of Power, terrifies me. If you knew the stories that I do, you would be terrified as well. If you do not wish me to destroy it, you must tell me why you would trust such an evil to reside in your lands.”

So Richter told her. He shared the entire story and held nothing back. The chaos seed told her of the Chaotic Shard, the release of energy, and the seeming years that he had spent trapped by the Bloodstone, the death of the “Voice” and the deal he had struck. She clucked her tongue at how he had promised the stone’s new consciousness a “home,” but didn’t interrupt. He finished by describing the spell that had transported all of them back to the village.

“I do not know why the hill and dungeon were transported as well, though,” he admitted at the end.

“Your spell teleported all living things,” Hisako said absently. Her face was no longer angry, but instead deeply contemplative. “I have told you that this,” she said indicating the Dungeon, “is no mere lair. It is a living thing. There is much I do not understand about Dungeons, and there is even more that I must learn about the Labyrinth. What I do know is that it will grow and evolve, both in size and power.”

Richter nodded and wondered if the Bloodstone had planned this all along. Had the relic known what the streams of raw chaos were changing the caves into? And the altered patches of land that were now surrounding the hill like a wall. It was almost as if they had been arranged to protect the Dungeon, or, more accurately, to protect the Bloodstone. Both Masters sat in silence for long minutes while they pondered the events unfolding around them.

It was Hisako that broke the silence, “Since you have come into my life, you have brought great change. You have returned the other half of our souls to The Land. A celestial tree grows in the heart of your village, and you have fought, and bled, beside us.”

She paused, “You have also awakened sleeping evils, however. Also, you have altered the fundamental nature of The Land. Never before has our alignment been anything but good or evil, but I can now read the chaos in your soul.” She sighed heavily, and scrubbed her face with her hands again. When she spoke, her tone was weary, a weariness that only comes from years of fighting a war with no end in sight, “I fear that you and your kind may be the end of all things, Lord Richter of the Mist Village. You alone have changed so much; I cannot fathom what will happen when more of your kind make themselves known.”

The Hearth Mother fell silent again, and once again, they sat in silence. Then, without preamble, she suddenly stood and began casting. Richter was afraid that she was planning to attack the Dungeon with some powerful magic, but he decided to trust her. How could he ask her to trust him if he wasn’t willing to extend the same courtesy? Hisako finished her spell a moment later. Her hands glowed gold for a moment, but nothing else happened. “I can sense no evil intent from the Dungeon, despite casting my strongest detection spell. I will leave this Chaotic Bloodstone in your care and will make no moves to destroy it if you promise to notify me of any evil.”

“I can do that,” Richter agreed.

The two leaders shook on it, each staring the other in the eye. It took all of Richter’s willpower to not react when a small voice spoke in his mind. A red light that occupied the portion of his psyche reserved for those he had made a psychic bond with pulsed in time with the words.

<<Well done, Dungeon Master. You have stopped the sprite’s wrathful retaliation, and the home you have provided will let me protect myself. I hold your oath fulfilled. I will now finish my bonding with the Dungeon. I do not know what this will change me into. It is very possible we shall never speak again. I will take this time to thank you. Enjoy these gifts with my compliments.>>

The psychic doorway in the chaos seed’s mind disappeared, and notifications filled his view. Richter was reminded of the last time a disembodied voice had left him presents, and wondered just what it boded for the future.

Richter absorbed the information from the prompts and quickly dismissed them. Many things shocked him. For one, reaching the initiate rank in Blood magic didn’t just have resistance and spell power perks. It also made it much easier for him to use those types of spells. Blood Mana could definitely come in handy, and the spell cost was negligible. Even more surprising was the puppet spell. If he was understanding the prompts properly, if he advanced far enough, he would learn every spell the Bloodstone had cast while using his body.

Hisako had started looking at him quizzically while he pondered his prompts. Then he realized it was probably because he was still holding her hand. He broke their clasp with a cough and stood back. Wanting a change of subject, he said, “I suppose all that remains is for me to choose the Harbinger.”

“I assumed that choice would be easy,” she replied. Hisako raised a hand and pointed at a patch of grass. He didn’t understand at first until he saw a faint movement. She had pointed unerringly at the shale adder when even he hadn’t known where it was.

“How did you… nevermind,” he finished shaking his head. “Are you sure I should use the adder? I don’t mind especially, though it’s been more than useful as a battle pet, but shouldn’t we pick a monster that is easier to kill if we plan on fighting in the Dungeon?”

“No,” Hisako said definitively. “One thing that I am sure about Dungeons is that the stronger the Item of Power and the Harbinger, the greater the rewards. Also, if the old stories are to be believed, there will come a time when you want your Dungeon to be as strong as possible.”

He almost asked her what she meant, but he felt like it was going to be a much longer conversation, and there was plenty of time for that. Richter was also distracted by her next statement, “I doubt you will be able to keep your pet Tamed much longer anyway, in light of the changes it has undergone.”

“Changes?” Richter asked. She just arched an eyebrow at him in answer, so Richter called the snake closer. When he used Analyze, he received a great shock.

Name: Chaotic ReptileCurrent Form: High Steel AdderDisposition: Friendly

This creature has been touched by raw Chaos. Its form and very nature will remain ever in flux. Its current form is that of a High Steel Adder. The scales of its multiple scale layers are comprised of high steel. Chaotic Reptiles are highly resistant to control of any type due to their nature. This creature will always retain its core characteristic: Camouflage.

Level: 20

Health: 740Mana: 210Stamina: 510

Strength: 30

Agility: 23

Dexterity: 27

Constitution: 74

Endurance: 51

Intelligence: 21

Wisdom: 17

Charisma: 5

Luck: 14





His pet’s stats hadn’t just jumped. They had lunged! The snake had almost twice as much health as it had before, and there was no way the fact that it had gained a single level could account for that. It also now had an appreciable amount of mana. All of its stats looked like they had been upgraded in fact, except for maybe its Agility and Dexterity. If the snake was lugging around multiple layers of high steel scales, though, that was only to be expected. The thing was a powerhouse!

Richter would have completely ignored Hisako’s advice and kept the pet if not for one line in its description. “Chaotic reptiles are highly resistant to control.” It meant that whenever his latest Tame spell wore off, he would be faced with an extremely powerful monster that was immune to the mists surrounding his village and that could strike from hiding with impunity. If it stayed in his lands, his people would have to live in a constant state of fear.

He shook his head. There was just too much he didn’t know. One thing he did now suspect, though, was that he would be a fool to ignore Hisako’s advice. The passage she had recited had also said he only had a day and a night to make a choice. The chaos seed wasn’t sure what happened after that, but the best case scenario he could think of was that the choice would be made randomly. Better the devil he knew than one he did not. Richter didn’t even want to think about what it might mean if an undead was chosen as the Harbinger. Somehow, he didn’t think that would be a good thing for him or his people.

Richter sent out a mental command, and the adder slid through the grass towards him. It rose up until its diamond shaped head hovered only inches from the chaos seed’s face. It occurred to him that he should be frightened that a predator was so close to him. After weeks of fighting alongside the adder, though, Richter felt a deep fondness for the creature. He just patted its scaly side, while its pink tongue shot out and licked his cheek.

The chaos seed felt a lump start to form in his throat, so he turned to Hisako, “How do I do it?”

She just shrugged, “I do not know, but that might be a good place to start.” She pointed at the black pedestal in front of the cave mouth.

Richter walked over and placed his hand on the sphere at the top of the black metal spire, and a prompt filled his vision.

Greetings Dungeon Master. Your Dungeon lies incomplete. Have you chosen a Harbinger? Yes or No?

Richter chose “Yes” and thought about his tamed pet.

Your choice is acceptable. Send the Harbinger forth.

He didn’t drag it out. Richter gave his last command to the adder and sent it inside of the cave mouth. He watched as its long length disappeared into the Dungeon. Suddenly, he had the impression that it felt a great but fleeting pain, and the light that represented their connection disappeared from his mind.

The sacrifice is accepted.

A new icon appeared in the corner of Richter’s vision.

The stone around the cave mouth began to shudder. Pieces fell off, and Richter feared he had triggered another earthquake. The tremors eased though and the stone of the cave began to flow. It reshaped itself in less than a minute until the opening was a perfect replica of an adder’s open mouth, down to the scales carved into the rock and large fangs hanging down from above. The Dungeon’s eyes glowed a very particular shade of red.

Another prompt appeared in Richter’s vision. After reading it, he forgot about everything else. The loot from the goblin encampment, his skill prompts waiting to be read, and learning about his hundreds of potential new villagers were all things that could wait. Even the Chaos points he had earned that were begging to be spent seemed less important in that moment. Nothing else mattered except what he had read.

Congratulations, Dungeon Master! The Dungeon of Bloody Chaos is born!
